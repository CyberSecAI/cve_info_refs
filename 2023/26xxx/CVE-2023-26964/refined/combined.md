### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

A protective and efficient HTTP library for all.

* HTTP/1 and HTTP/2
* Asynchronous design
* Leading in performance
* Tested and **correct**
* Extensive production use
* Client and Server APIs

**Get started** by looking over the [guides](https://hyper.rs/guides/1/).

## "Low-level"

hyper is a relatively low-level library, meant to be a building block for
libraries and applications.

If you are looking for a convenient HTTP client, then you may wish to consider
[reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest).

If you are not sure what HTTP server to choose, then you may want to consider
[axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) or
[warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp), the latter taking a more functional
approach. Both are built on top of this library.

## Contributing

To get involved, take a look at [CONTRIBUTING](/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you prefer chatting, there is an active community in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kkwpueZ).

### **[qinyushun](/qinyushun)** commented [May 27, 2022](#issue-1250904722)

| **Version** hyper-0.13.7 h2-0.2.4  **Platform** wsl  **Description**  **Summary：**  ​ Stream stacking occurs when Hyper processes HTTP2 RST\_STREAM frames. As a result, the memory and CPU usage are high.  **Step：**   1. Send an `HEADERS` frame to open the stream, followed by an `RST_STREAM` frame to request cancellation of the stream     ```    def reset_flood(h2_conn):        for i in range(1, 20000):            if i % 2 == 0:                continue            headers(h2_conn, i)            rst_stream(h2_conn, i)        ``` 2. Create multiple threads for sending.     ```    if __name__ == '__main__':        for i in range(0, 400):            try:                _thread.start_new_thread(send, ("Thread-" + str(i),))            except:                print("Error: Can not start thread")        while 1:            pass        ```   **Result：**  The CPU usage of the Hyper server keeps increasing. As a result, the VM memory is used up. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84489880/170728747-1095f85d-d85e-4198-a58b-c491e77afc94.png)  **Vulnerability analysis:**  When receiving a `HEADERS` frame, the `h2` stores the corresponding stream content in the `slab` and sets a frame index to the `ids`. When receiving an `RST_STREAM` frame, `h2` sets the stream to `Closed` and resets the related statistics. However, the stream memory is released only when `stream.is_released() is true` . When the `RST_STREAM` frame is received, the release is not triggered immediately. As a result, the size of the slab increases continuously.  **Test procedure:**  Add the `slab_len()`,`ids_len()` method for Store to return the length of all flows and active flows. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84489880/170728820-fa8f6353-eda0-4c46-a3c7-aefa945f39a8.png)  Add the preceding two stream lengths to the `recv_reset()` method. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84489880/170728882-b3e4255b-eda8-4cb6-b384-354f104213c3.png)  **After the test, when the HEADERS frame is repeatedly sent to open a stream or the RST\_STREAM frame is sent to cancel the stream, the length of the ids does not exceed the value of max\_recv, but the SLAB increases .The stream in the Closed state in the SLAB is released only after all frames on the connection are sent.** [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84489880/170729057-4dfda2f2-9a28-4c88-9cc4-c62ae23bea20.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84489880/170732474-dc74b544-f53c-4d0b-b797-d3729017ba20.png)  The `max_concurrent_streams` configuration can limit `max_recv_streams`, but it appears that in this scenario, the size of `Slab` is much larger than the `max_concurrent_streams` value and stacks up.  I think it is necessary to limit the size of the `Slab` or ensure that streams in the `Slab` can be released quickly after the `RST_STREAM` frame is received to prevent such attacks. |

| Sounds like something we could try to fix. What is making the slab hold onto the memory? My guess is that it needs to hold the stream info while there is an `Event` that can be polled, so that a user `accept`ing requests will see it was reset, is that it? |

| Um. Ok. I'm sure you just wanted to see this fixed. But this is **NOT** how to do things. Filing a drive-by CVE like this is like seeing a lighter in a school and pulling the fire alarm.  There is a [SECURITY](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/SECURITY.md) policy if you ever feel something is a vulnerability. Then we can better coordinate.  [Be Kind](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). That includes considering we're all humans contributing, and respecting time is part of being kind.  I'm also extremely disappointed that [@github](https://github.com/github) facilitated this.  That said, fire alarm time.   ---   **If you're here from a dependabot warning, or similar**: I'll be working on this today. I will update this issue when there is a version you can upgrade to. Some things you can do to determine if you can just safely ignore the dependabot warning:   * If you're not using HTTP/2, ignore. * If you're using a client, with HTTP/2, but you're talking to your own servers, or you at least control the URLs to talk to servers you trust to not attack your client (most businesses), ignore.   The fix will likely be an `h2` version, hyper will not need to be changed. |

| This CVE is going to cause a flurry of unnecessary emergency response work across the ecosystem--even for use cases that are totally un-impacted by the bug. Every application that depends on Hyper is now going to have to ship out-of-cycle fixes to address the CVE, even if the application has **nothing** to do with HTTP/2.  Going through the documented SECURITY process isn't a feel good exercise: it allows stakeholders to coordinate about the severity and breadth of an issue's impact. |

| An update: from what I can tell, the report is that the slab store of streams grows because its holding two events, `[HEADERS, RESET]` essentially, so that the user can notice them when they call `conn.accept()`. I have the skeleton of a unit test, it's not that great, but it lets me adjust the conditions a bit: <https://github.com/hyperium/h2/compare/sean/reset-streams-growing>.  It appears that as long as the server is accepting requests, the slab is actually cleared out. Looking in the original report, I can't find what the server is doing (it's `target/release/server2`?).  Also, here's the chat thread for this: <https://discord.com/channels/500028886025895936/1095696565689122967> |

| This CVE is going to cause a flurry of unnecessary emergency response work across the ecosystem  What do you mean with "unnecessary"?  Finding out whether or not you are affected isn't unnecessary. Updating to an unaffected version is not possible, because there is no unaffected version as of now; every version of hyper is potentially vulnerable. The only thing people *can* do is to disable the "h2" feature if they have it enabled, which would prevent this attack. |

| What do you mean with "unnecessary"?  The whole point of a SECURITY policy is to respond in a reasonable way - reproduce identify scope, write tests, prepare fix, etc. Should we really report a CVE before confirming with the maintainers that it's 1. reproducible and 2. something that has an available fix ready to deploy? It would have been better to follow the requested SECURITY policy so that the response can be more coordinated. It's better to be sure first before declaring a vulnerability. |

| This issue was opened almost a year ago. The maintainers had more than enough time to reproduce the bug and prepare a fix.  It is still very unclear whether there is a vulnerability or an issue. The submitter claims there is one but needs to provide a report by which they achieved that result. The maintainers have yet to reproduce under normal conditions. The only way to reproduce seems to be either a) misusing `h2` or b) an application that lags behind and explicitly is asking for the state to be held (though it could be that the implication of the API is unclear). |

Does the issue not show how to reproduce this. I'm sorry but I don't exactly blame the person who made the CVE here. This was reported and was marked as moderate on the CVE website.  I can't imagine it's that rare of a situation for people to use http2 streams here, so I don't know why it's being minimized so much.  Be kind should also apply to not scolding your community members. I'm sure this wasn't meant out of malice and was simply meant to bring awareness to the issue at hand.  That being said, i'm seeing people refer to it being marked as high severity, but both github and nist are reporting as moderate, which I think is fair. |

| Does the issue not show how to reproduce this. I'm sorry but I don't exactly blame the person who made the CVE here. This was reported and was marked as moderate on the CVE website.  No, it looks like the maintainers/contributors were having a hard time figuring out exactly how to reproduce it/where the vulnerability is, or if it's just an API misuse. As I understand from the fire alarm discord thread, the large number of requests needed to reproduce in OPs case also confuse it. In general it's not very clear how/where the vulnerability lies. and this is emergency work that the maintainers now have to perform, without even a super concise repro case, instead of it being disclosed properly.  It's generally good practice to at least mention to the maintainer that you'll be filing a CVE, even if just to give advance warning, but also just to see if you are misunderstanding it. **Even if it turns out to be severe,** it's still best practice to communicate with maintainers about it for all of the reasons above. |

| Does the issue not show how to reproduce this.  It unfortunately does not. About 4 people have been working on this all day trying to figure out what the actual reproduction of this is. This makes it quite stressful to just guess at what a fix is, when we can't confirm that's what they meant in the first place.  I'm sure this wasn't meant out of malice and was simply meant to bring awareness to the issue at hand.  I acknowledged in my first comment this morning that I assume the person just wanted it fixed, not assuming they were being evil. But this is not the right way to get attention. There were several more steps that could have been taken. |

| Another update, this should be classified as **low severity**. The attack requires sufficient bandwidth to overload Hyper's accept loop. The original submitter 400 threads over localhost against hyper's 1 thread. This would not be easy to trigger over a network (though possible). Additionally, systems return to normal once the attack completes.  In practice, I don't expect many to be vulnerable to such an attack due to the difficulty of triggering it via remote network and in terms of severity, a botnet attack triggering a DOS by overloading the pipe would be a greater risk.  That said, the Hyper maintainers are currently investigating a patch that could mitigate this specific attack. |

Just one question: why is it not easy to trigger 400 client threads over the network against 1 server thread? Seems dead simple and is what every ddos framework can do, no? Am I misinterpreting your answer maybe?  Thanks for all the work from everyone involved again! It's appreciated! |

| It isn't a matter of threading, but of bandwidth. You can only send so many bytes as the pipe allows, snd that has to be enough to saturate the hyper accept loop.  This is easy enough to do over localhost, where bandwidth is arbitrarily high, not so much over the public internet |

| why is it not easy to trigger over the network against 1 server thread?  This is our current theory (can't confirm it's what the original reporter meant): if you can flood the network faster than the server is able to "accept" requests, the queue of pending-to-accept-but-reset requests can keep growing. This is because the accept method is basically `read_from_socket(); yield_pending_request()`. The task in hyper that is "accepting" requests is very tight: it's simply focused on `accept(); spawn_task_to_handle_request()`. If you could fill up the TCP read buffer again with a bunch of more requests before we did that simple loop, over and over and over, that could keep growing the internal queue.  So, if it is over the network, not local, then latency, backpressure, and TCP flow control would make it harder to fill up the server's buffer faster than it can spawn a task to handle the request.  But again, this is just our best guess. |

Streams that have been received by the peer, but not accepted by the
user, can also receive a RST_STREAM. This is a legitimate pattern: one
could send a request and then shortly after, realize it is not needed,
sending a CANCEL.

However, since those streams are now \"closed\", they don't count towards
the max concurrent streams. So, they will sit in the accept queue, using
memory.

In most cases, the user is calling `accept` in a loop, and they can
accept requests that have been reset fast enough that this isn't an
issue in practice.

But if the peer is able to flood the network faster than the server
accept loop can run (simply accepting, not processing requests; that
tends to happen in a separate task), the memory could grow.

So, this introduces a maximum count for streams in the pending-accept
but remotely-reset state. If the maximum is reached, a GOAWAY frame with
the error code of ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM is sent, and the connection marks
itself as errored.

Affected Functions
Version
`openssl::x509::X509NameBuilder::build`

* `<0.10.48, >=0.9.7`

### Description

OpenSSL has a `modified` bit that it can set on on `X509_NAME` objects. If this
bit is set then the object is not thread-safe even when it appears the code is
not modifying the value.

Thanks to David Benjamin (Google) for reporting this issue.

0](/advisories/GHSA-f8vr-r385-rh5r/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

h2
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.3.17

## Patched versions

0.3.17

## Description

Hyper is an HTTP library for Rust and h2 is an HTTP 2.0 client & server implementation for Rust. An issue was discovered in h2 v0.2.4 when processing header frames. It incorrectly processes the HTTP2 `RST_STREAM` frames by not always releasing the memory immediately upon receiving the reset frame, leading to stream stacking. As a result, the memory and CPU usage are high which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).

This issue affects users only when dealing with http2 connections.

### Description

If an attacker is able to flood the network with pairs of `HEADERS`/`RST_STREAM` frames, such that the `h2` application is not able to accept them faster than the bytes are received, the pending accept queue can grow in memory usage. Being able to do this consistently can result in excessive memory use, and eventually trigger Out Of Memory.

This flaw is corrected in [hyperium/h2#668](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/668), which restricts remote reset stream count by default.

| [@seanmonstar](https://github.com/seanmonstar) As described in the issue in hyper, I think the size of the slab should be limited to max\_concurrent\_streams + max\_concurrent\_reset\_streams . When the size of the slab exceeds the upper limit, the recv\_frame method should discard the received Headers and PushPromise frames and send the protocol error to the client. [hyperium/hyper#2877](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2877)  Drop the Headers and PushPromise frames here and throw a GoAway error.

### Description

`tokio::io::ReadHalf<T>::unsplit` can violate the `Pin` contract

The soundness issue is described in the [tokio/issues#5372](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/5372)

Specific set of conditions needed to trigger an issue (a !Unpin type in ReadHalf)
is unusual, combined with the difficulty of making any arbitrary use-after-free
exploitable in Rust without doing a lot of careful alignment of data types in
the surrounding code.

The `tokio` feature `io-util` is also required to be enabled to trigger this
soundness issue.

Thanks to zachs18 reporting the issue to Tokio team responsibly and taiki-e
and carllerche appropriately responding and fixing the soundness bug.

Tokio before 0.2.0 used `futures` 0.1 that did not have `Pin`, so it is not
affected by this issue.

### @seanmonstar **[seanmonstar](/seanmonstar)** commented [Apr 13, 2023](#issue-1665434843)

Streams that have been received by the peer, but not accepted by the user, can also receive a RST\_STREAM. This is a legitimate pattern: one could send a request and then shortly after, realize it is not needed, sending a CANCEL.

However, since those streams are now "closed", they don't count towards the max concurrent streams. So, they will sit in the accept queue, using memory.

In most cases, the user is calling `accept` in a loop, and they can accept requests that have been reset fast enough that this isn't an issue in practice.

But if the peer is able to flood the network faster than the server accept loop can run (simply accepting, not processing requests; that tends to happen in a separate task), the memory could grow.

So, this introduces a maximum count for streams in the pending-accept but remotely-reset state. If the maximum is reached, a GOAWAY frame with the error code of ENHANCE\_YOUR\_CALM is sent, and the connection marks itself as errored.

Closes [hyperium/hyper#2877](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2877) (we assume)

| Since this seems like something that occurs due to several dynamic factors or behaviours, a single hard coded limit *on paper* seems too restrictive. Not least because it isn't immediately obvious where the value `20` comes from. This might be an entirely reasonable value but without some wider testing, who knows? A default value that can be tweaked via API seems like a decent middleground to me. |

I'm in favor of merging this now as is, but we should in the future make the threshold configurable.

| I'm summarizing a conversation [@seanmonstar](https://github.com/seanmonstar) and I had in Discord here:  There is a non-zero chance that the threshold we set does trip on real (and non-malicious) traffic. We have a log line in here for if this goes off, but it might be worthwhile for us to expose an actual metric for these GOAWAYs so that users of the library can better understand how frequently this trips. |

| Given that I've been at this for 14 hours, I'm going to go knock out. Since the assumed problem is quite hard to trigger, and that the fix here is a guess, and that there's always some amount of risk when publishing new versions, I'm opting for leaving this open for the night. |

`[fix: limit the amount of pending-accept reset streams](/hyperium/h2/pull/668/commits/d5f31859f071c8e91839bc9cdd8a75e4d2159bd6 "fix: limit the amount of pending-accept reset streams

Streams that have been received by the peer, but not accepted by the
user, can also receive a RST_STREAM. This is a legitimate pattern: one
could send a request and then shortly after, realize it is not needed,
sending a CANCEL.

However, since those streams are now \"closed\", they don't count towards
the max concurrent streams. So, they will sit in the accept queue, using
memory.

In most cases, the user is calling `accept` in a loop, and they can
accept requests that have been reset fast enough that this isn't an
issue in practice.

But if the peer is able to flood the network faster than the server
accept loop can run (simply accepting, not processing requests; that
tends to happen in a separate task), the memory could grow.

So, this introduces a maximum count for streams in the pending-accept
but remotely-reset state. If the maximum is reached, a GOAWAY frame with
the error code of ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM is sent, and the connection marks
itself as errored.

## Hey, this is us 👋

[![An illustration showing a variety of differently themed Octocats. Monuments from different cities are indicated in the background like the Space Needle, Berlin Fernsehturm and Transamerica Pyramid.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)

Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **October 19th, 2007**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 2.5 million commits**, opened **over 1 million issues**, submitted roughly **650k pull requests** across **4357 repositories** from over **50 countries**. 🤯 But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system. 🪐 Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
* Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
* **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things, ☝️ are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

* [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
* [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) - A visual approach to using Git with GitHub
* [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
* [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system

### 👓 Appendix

See what's next on our [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap) ✨ and [let us know](https://github.com/github/feedback) if you have any suggestions. 🙇‍♂️ Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to [join our team](https://github.com/about/careers). 🙌

"Tell me more, I can't get enough!"

* GitHub is built using mighty 🔨 open source technologies like [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails), [Go](https://github.com/golang), [Primer](https://github.com/primer), [React](https://github.com/reactjs) and [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) among others.
* The three open source projects GitHub members have most contributed 👩‍💻 to are:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
  + [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
  + [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew)
* By the way, our [documentation](https://github.com/github/docs) 🤓 is also open sourced.

* `<0.10.48, >=0.9.7`

### Description

`SubjectAlternativeName` and `ExtendedKeyUsage` arguments were parsed using the OpenSSL
function `X509V3_EXT_nconf`. This function parses all input using an OpenSSL mini-language
which can perform arbitrary file reads.

## Hey, this is us 👋

[![An illustration showing a variety of differently themed Octocats. Monuments from different cities are indicated in the background like the Space Needle, Berlin Fernsehturm and Transamerica Pyramid.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)

Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **October 19th, 2007**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 2.5 million commits**, opened **over 1 million issues**, submitted roughly **650k pull requests** across **4357 repositories** from over **50 countries**. 🤯 But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system. 🪐 Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
* Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
* **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things, ☝️ are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

* [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
* [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) - A visual approach to using Git with GitHub
* [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
* [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system

### 👓 Appendix

See what's next on our [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap) ✨ and [let us know](https://github.com/github/feedback) if you have any suggestions. 🙇‍♂️ Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to [join our team](https://github.com/about/careers). 🙌

"Tell me more, I can't get enough!"

* GitHub is built using mighty 🔨 open source technologies like [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails), [Go](https://github.com/golang), [Primer](https://github.com/primer), [React](https://github.com/reactjs) and [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) among others.
* The three open source projects GitHub members have most contributed 👩‍💻 to are:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
  + [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
  + [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew)
* By the way, our [documentation](https://github.com/github/docs) 🤓 is also open sourced.
