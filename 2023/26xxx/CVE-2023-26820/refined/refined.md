The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26820.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of path traversal checks in `index.js` when serving local files. Specifically, the code does not sanitize or validate the requested file path, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Path Traversal vulnerability: The application does not properly validate user-supplied file paths, enabling attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read any file on the server that the application user has access to. This can lead to information disclosure, including sensitive data like configuration files, source code, and user data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the server. An attacker can send a request with a crafted file path containing directory traversal sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No special access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
The attacker can be on the same network or send HTTP requests to a public server.
The vulnerability could be exploited whether the instance is being proxied by nginx or not. The original vulnerability was for the direct access, whereas the second form of the vulnerability was when being proxied by nginx.
