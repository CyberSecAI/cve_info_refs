- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM Web UI is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering the intended functionality. This could lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI, attackers can exploit the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
