{
  "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue present in markdown-it-py versions prior to 2.2.0. The vulnerability can be triggered if an attacker provides specially crafted input that leads to null assertions within the code, causing the program to crash.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "CWE-173"
  ],
  "impact_of_exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service, potentially causing the application to crash and become unavailable.",
  "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker needs to provide a crafted input string to the markdown parser, which implies a remote attack.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "A low level of privileges is required, meaning the attacker doesn't need any particular access level to trigger the issue. Also, no user interaction is needed.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the presence of unnecessary assertions within the code. These assertions, when triggered by specific input, cause the program to crash. The fix involves removing these assertions and adding checks to handle cases that could have been previously lead to crashes."
