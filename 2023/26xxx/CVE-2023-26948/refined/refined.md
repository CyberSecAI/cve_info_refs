```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `app\\admin\\controller\\File#download` method directly does not filter the incoming `url` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file reading vulnerability due to lack of input validation on the `url` parameter in the file download function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, including sensitive files like the database configuration file (.env).",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user can send a crafted HTTP GET request to `/admin1/file/download` with a `url` parameter that contains a relative path (e.g., `../.env`) to access arbitrary files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, `/admin1/file/download`."
