Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Cacheservice "registerGroup" API. Specifically, parameters injected into this API were not sufficiently sanitized, allowing for the injection of SQL syntax. This unsanitized input was later executed during the creation of new cache groups, which introduced a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  By injecting malicious SQL code into the "registerGroup" API, an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Accessing and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data, causing data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with access to the local or restricted network where the vulnerable service is running.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Cacheservice "registerGroup" API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same local or restricted network as the vulnerable server.
*   **API Access:** The attacker must be able to make calls to the Cacheservice API.
*   **No user Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that no public exploits are known.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2023-02-13 and fixed on 2023-03-14.
*   The affected product is OX App Suite office 8.10 and fixed in 8.11
