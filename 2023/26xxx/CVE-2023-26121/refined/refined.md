Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26121

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `safe-eval` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper sanitization of its parameter content. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an attacker to access host error objects during stack trace generation, which can then be used for prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects.
- **Unsafe `Error.prepareStackTrace` usage:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `Error.prepareStackTrace` function and its access to the call stack during error handling, allowing for manipulation of the `__proto__` property

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values, attackers can cause code to fail and result in a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the code evaluates an attribute of an object and executes it, an attacker can leverage prototype pollution to execute code.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties the code relies on, such as security properties, to gain unauthorized access or privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides malicious code as input to the `safeEval` function.
- The provided code manipulates the `Error.prepareStackTrace` function to access and pollute the `__proto__`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input to the vulnerable `safeEval` function.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to pollute the prototype by manipulating the `Error.prepareStackTrace` function during the generation of a stack trace.

The Snyk advisory also provides details on:
-  CVSS scores (7.5 High from Snyk and 10 Critical from NVD)
-  Explanation of prototype pollution attacks (unsafe object merges, property definition by path)
-  Mitigation strategies (freezing prototypes, schema validation, avoiding unsafe merges, using objects without prototypes)

The vulnerability report notes that there is currently no fixed version of the library.
