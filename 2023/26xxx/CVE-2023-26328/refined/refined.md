The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26328.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting memory.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to execute malicious code in the context of the current user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system. The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning that the exploit is relatively easy to carry out. The attack does not require privileges (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R). The vulnerability has a scope of unchanged (S:U) meaning it does not affect other components of the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs to get a user to trigger the vulnerability by opening a malicious file.
