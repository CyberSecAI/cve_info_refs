The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26062.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper access control within the Nokia Web Element Manager, specifically allowing an unprivileged user to execute administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect access control: The system fails to properly restrict access to administrative functions, allowing an unprivileged logged-in user to execute them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user with access to the internal management network of the mobile network solution can execute administrative functions, potentially leading to unauthorized modification or disruption of the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can only be exploited from within the Communication Service Provider's (CSP) mobile network solution's internal BTS management network. Exploitation is not possible from outside the mobile network solution architecture, such as from mobile network user UEs, roaming networks, or the Internet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account (although unprivileged) to log in to the Nokia Web Element Manager.
- The attacker must have access to the CSP's mobile network solution's internal BTS management network.
