{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-26435",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application did not properly sanitize ODT (Open Document Text) files, allowing an attacker to inject malicious references to local filesystem and network resources using manipulated ODT documents and 'draw' XML fragments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially discover restricted network topology and services. Furthermore, they could access local files on the server with the read permissions of the open-xchange system user. This was limited to specific file-types such as images.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, leveraging manipulated ODT files.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A low-privileged attacker is required to upload a manipulated ODT document to exploit the vulnerability."
