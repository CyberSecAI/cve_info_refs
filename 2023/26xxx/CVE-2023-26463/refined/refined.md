To rekey IKE and Child SAs with multiple key exchanges, `IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE` exchanges are used, as defined in RFC 9370.\n\n  In proposals, additional key exchange methods are configured via `keX_` prefix, where `X` is a number between 1 and 7. For example, `ke1_mlkem768` adds ML-KEM-768 as additional KE method (works with any key exchange method, whether post-quantum or classic). As with regular key exchanges, peers have to agree on a method for each round unless no algorithms are defined by both or `keX_none` is configured to make that round explicitly optional.\n*   Support for the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM, [FIPS 203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)), a key exchange method that, at present, is believed to be secure even against adversaries who possess a quantum computer, has been added via Botan 3.6.0+ (`botan` plugin), wolfSSL 5.7.4+ (`wolfssl` plugin), AWS-LC 1.37.0+ (`openssl` plugin), and the new `ml` plugin. The keywords for ML-KEM-512 (128 bits security strength), ML-KEM-768 (192 bits), ML-KEM-1024 (256 bits) are `mlkem512`, `mlkem768` and `mlkem1024`, respectively.\n*   `AF_VSOCK` sockets can be used on Linux to communicate with a daemon that runs in a VM (e.g. via the `vici` plugin).\n*   The file logger can optionally log messages as JSON objects ([a2fba6d](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/a2fba6db4a17d967d425e63212057e921581090c), [bea1f11](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/bea1f1100ee14264808268bd5cdb6df7a8ea382c), see [the docs](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/latest/config/logging.html#_file_loggers) for details), and can add timestamps in microseconds via the new `time_precision` setting ([#2475](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/pull/2475)).\n\n### Enhancements and Optimizations\n\n*   Handling of CHILD_SA rekey collisions has been improved ([d2b2e1b](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/d2b2e1b3fae8b49b4c412ee1492d18638d17e497)). This makes CHILD_SAs properly trackable via `child_rekey()` hook and some corner cases are also handled correctly e.g. if a responder's `DELETE` for the new CHILD_SA arrives before its `CREATE_CHILD_SA` response that creates that SA in the first place. Also handled properly are responders of rekeyings that incorrectly send a `DELETE` for the old CHILD_SA (previously, this caused both, the new and the old SA, to get deleted).\n*   The behavior when reloading or unloading connections that include `start` in their `start_action` has been improved ([#2324](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2324), [#2418](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2418)).\n*   If no identity is configured but a certificate is available, the subject DN is used instead of the IP address ([#2353](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2353)).\n*   The `cert-enroll` script now supports three generations of CA certificates ([f59ca96](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/f59ca9698a39f617db6b6efbcbd7d9b18193a17c)).\n*   IKE ports are now considered when matching connections ([9228a51](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/9228a5109b8d9a6e1469abefba2fdfc44aeabe7a), [6928709](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/6928709886a1872fc91864e531aada1252c57c24)).\n*   The base address of in-memory IP address pools is now reported as configured ([#2264](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2264)).\n*   IKE fragment sizes can be configured for each address family explicitly ([84bd011](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/84bd011752bf6d5fbaf4900dc4037445dd78a4dd)).\n*   The `openssl` plugin can use the `EVP_DigestSqueeze()` API for XOFs, which was introduced with OpenSSL 3.3 ([3d0f695](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/3d0f6958a9f49e8aaae3113eaf0aab51821b1e56)).\n*   The `kernel-netlink` plugin explicitly configures the direction of IPsec SAs when running on 6.10+ kernels ([abdc787](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/abdc7878a4cea0250eb3f46ab9acb906b82245d4)).\n*   The Android app was updated for compatibility with Android 14 ([740cbb2](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/740cbb2c0ab8116753e352cac41dbf922f65e555)), a bug was fixed that affects importing already existing VPN profiles ([9b9cf20](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/9b9cf2001f071eba3bb819cb85db4e5083ed3c83)).\n\n### Fixes\n\n*   The NetworkManager plugin (`charon-nm`) now uses a different routing table than the regular IKE daemon to avoid conflicts if both are running ([#2230](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2230)).\n*   TUN devices can properly handle IPv6 addresses ([fccc764](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/fccc76449dc5f135147c6167739916408753f66b)) and routes via them are now correctly installed on FreeBSD ([bf165af](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/bf165afb780b7ba4edd2092b3348038c0a14b7ae)).\n*   Reassigning a matching online lease is now preferred over an offline lease by the in-memory IP address pool to avoid conflicts with make-before-break reauthentication and multiple IKE_SAs per identity ([#2472](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/discussions/2472)).\n*   To avoid conflicts with other processes when using ephemeral UDP ports, the `socket-default` plugin now always opens IPv4 sockets before IPv6 sockets ([#2494](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/discussions/2494)).\n*   Challenge passwords in PKCS#10 containers are again encoded as `PrintableString` if possible to be compatible with older SCEP implementations ([8e88d56](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/8e88d562064821bbb30e831906e1feed11016389)).\n*   The `vici` plugin now uses the same ESP proposals (AEAD before regular) when configuring `default` instead of not configuring `esp_proposals` at all ([8e020bc](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/8e020bc9e31ecd7e08bdf6116e110d189ce26c90)).\n*   Fixed handling of adopted reqids during IKEv1 rekeying ([d02aea9](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/d02aea9c2cef7c9509fe61f674d3b468e5c7a12f), bug was introduced in 5.9.12).\n*   A typo in the `cert-enroll` script prevented successful signalling of a change of the sub CA certificate ([957aae8](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/957aae8f646d6e4e37d62efc505f2c6f7181c879)).\n\n### Plugin and Configuration Changes\n\n*   The legacy `stroke` plugin is **no longer enabled** by default and must be enabled explicitly.\n*   The `openssl` plugin is now **enabled** by default, while the following crypto plugins are **no longer enabled** by default: `aes`, `curve25519`, `des`, `fips-prf`, `gmp`, `hmac`, `md5`, `pkcs12`, `rc2`, `sha1`, `sha2`.\n*   The following **deprecated plugins** have been **removed**: `bliss` (signature scheme), `newhope` (key exchange method), `ntru` (key exchange method).\n*   `charon.make_before_break` is now **enabled** by default, which initiates IKEv2 [reauthentication](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/latest/config/rekeying.html) with a **make-before-break** instead of a **break-before-make** scheme. Make-before-break creates overlapping IKE and Child SA during reauthentication by first recreating all SAs before deleting the old ones. This behavior can be beneficial to avoid connectivity gaps during reauthentication (unlike rekeying still not completely without interruption), but requires support for overlapping SAs by the peer. strongSwan can handle such overlapping SAs since version 5.3.0.\n\n### For Developers\n\n*   Using the `child_rekey()` hook now allows tracking CHILD_SAs correctly in case of rekey collisions. The event is generally only triggered once after installing the outbound SA for the new/winning CHILD_SA. However, in some cases the event is triggered twice, but it is now ensured that listeners can properly transition to the winning SA.\n*   Refer to the documentation of [`key_exchange_method_t` interface](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/blob/master/src/libstrongswan/crypto/key_exchange.h) to learn how KEMs can be implemented in plugins.\n*   The format of key exchange test vectors has been changed so they can be used for KEMs and classic DH methods ([4067678](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/40676786aa403d0175b48f8f1d902a72755a9ab5)).\n*   The NetworkManager frontend's build files have been updated to not rely on `gnome-common`. It now also uses `gettext` directly instead of `intltool` ([5019e3e](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/5019e3ece012d35132fe6fe17ef7d192968de098)).\n*   Performance of running tests in the [testing environment](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/latest/devs/testingEnvironment.html) has been improved.\n\nRefer to [the 6.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/milestone/13?closed=1) for a list of all closed issues and pull requests.",

The OCSP responses for local certificates are currently retrieved via *revocation* plugin, either from the cache or fetched from an OCSP server (see the developer notes for details). The feature can be controlled via `<conn>.ocsp` setting in [swanctl.conf](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/swanctl/swanctlConf.html). By default, OCSP responses are sent if the peer requests any and a response can be retrieved.\n\n  If sending requests is enabled, the implementation generally sends an empty OCSP certificate request payload. Only if self-signed OCSP signer certificates are found locally will their public key's hash be added to the payload. Such certificates must either have the `OCSPSigning` extended key usage flag set, or be placed in the `x509ocsp` directory so that they are flagged when loaded.\n*   The Android app now supports managed configurations via enterprise mobility management (EMM) systems ([#2005](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/pull/2005)). Besides configuring global settings and VPN profiles (with settings similar to those supported in profile files, including certificates), this also provides management options for disabling certain features of the app (e.g. to prevent users from creating and/or importing custom profiles or to only display managed profiles).\n*   Added support for PSS padding for smartcard-based RSA signatures to the [*pkcs11* plugin](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/plugins/pkcs11.html), using either on-chip or external data hashing.\n*   Added keyid and certid handles to the [`pki --ocsp`](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/pki/pkiOcsp.html) command so that keys and/or certificates can be stored on a smartcard or in a TPM 2.0 device (note that this may add quite a delay to generating OCSP responses).\n\n### Enhancements and Optimizations\n\n*   Validation of X.509 name constraints has been refactored to align with RFC 5280 ([#2114](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/2114)). This fixes several limitations of the previous implementation. Name constraints are now correctly propagated from the root of the certificate chain so that intermediate CA certificates don't have to explicitly inherit the name constraints of their parents anymore. The latter previously prevented adding constraints in an intermediate CA certificate that's followed by another that doesn't contain any name constraints. This is perfectly fine as the set of constraints specified by the parent continue to apply to that intermediate CA certificate and the children it issues.\n\n  Identities also don't have to match all name constraints of the same type anymore, which prevented actually encoding multiple constraints of the same type because e.g. for the permitted name constraints for `example.org` and `example.com` no acceptable certificates could be issued as any SAN with one domain would get rejected by the other constraint. In compliance with the RFC, matching a single constraint is now enough.\n\n  Also resolved is an issue with name constraints for IP addresses (added with [5.9.12](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/releases/tag/5.9.12)), which were previously only supported for a single level.\n*   The [*dhcp* plugin](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/plugins/dhcp.html) has been ported to FreeBSD/macOS ([#2047](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/pull/2047)). The code for BPF handling has been refactored and is now shared between *dhcp* and *farp* plugin.\n*   The *openssl* plugin is now compatible to [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc), a crypto library based on code from BoringSSL and OpenSSL ([#1907](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/1907)).\n*   The identity enforced by the configuration was added to the message logged when identities don't match ([#2088](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/pull/2088)).\n\n### Fixes\n\n*   Overflows of unique identifiers (e.g. Netlink sequence numbers or reqids) are now handled gracefully when the daemon is running for a very long time without restart ([#2062](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/pull/2062)).\n*   Fail the installation of SAs on Linux if replay protection is disabled while extended sequence numbers (ESN) are enabled ([#2117](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/discussions/2117)). This combination is currently not supported by the Linux kernel and strongSwan previously just installed the SA without ESN, causing the other end to drop packets if it was an implementation that didn't do this.\n\n### For Developers\n\n*   The optional
