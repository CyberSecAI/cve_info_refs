- **Root cause:** Access of an uninitialized pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak, potentially leading to further issues if the uninitialized pointer is dereferenced and used in a way that leads to more serious consequences.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally, requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access and to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file.
