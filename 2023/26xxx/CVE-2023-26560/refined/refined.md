Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-26560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Inadequate access control in CFEngine's Mission Portal regarding scheduled reports.
*   Scheduled reports are executed with elevated privileges, allowing users with report access to query the database with functions like `pg_read_binary_file` without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** The vulnerability allows a Mission Portal user with access to scheduled reports to read arbitrary files on the system that the `cfpostgres` user has access to, using PostgreSQL functions such as `pg_read_binary_file`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Scheduled reports are executed with elevated privileges, bypassing normal access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive files such as database contents (including `/var/cfengine/state/pg/data/`), logs, and other files accessible by the `cfpostgres` user.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**
    *   Information about hosts that a user shouldn't normally see due to RBAC filtering.
    *   LDAP username and password used in settings (if LDAP authentication is configured).
    *   Usernames and password hashes for all (non-LDAP) Mission Portal users.
*   **Database Compromise:**  Access to database files could allow an attacker to restore the database and potentially gain control over the CFEngine system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Scheduled Reports:** The vulnerability is specific to scheduled reports within CFEngine's Mission Portal.
*   **SQL Injection (Indirect):**  Attackers leverage SQL functions within a scheduled report's query to read files outside of normal access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Mission Portal Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the CFEngine Mission Portal.
*   **Scheduled Report Access:** The attacker must have been granted permission to use scheduled reports through RBAC settings. This is the most important requirement as it would typically not be enabled for non-admin users.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** While not strictly necessary to exploit, a basic understanding of SQL and PostgreSQL functions such as `pg_read_binary_file` is needed to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects CFEngine versions 3.6.0 and later.
*   The issue is limited to scheduled reports due to the context in which queries are run.
*   The hotfix provided restricts access to the affected files and rotates secrets, but also removes the superuser role from the root database user.
*   CFEngine versions 3.18.4 and 3.21.1 contain fixes for the vulnerability.

The provided cfengine policy file aims to remediate the vulnerability by:

*   Ensuring the `root` database user does not have the `superuser` role.
*   Granting the `root` database user all privileges on all tables and sequences in the `public` schema of the `cfdb` and `cfsettings` databases.
*   Rotating the credentials of the `CFE_ROBOT` user.
