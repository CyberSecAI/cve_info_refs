bundle agent CVE\_2023\_26560
#@ brief Remediate CVE-2023-26560
#@ description On an enterprise hub, ensure that root does not have superuser role and rotate CFE\_ROBOT credentials if necessary
#@
#@ \*\*Manually integrating into policy\*\*
#@
#@ To integrate into policy manually add the policy file to inputs, and ensure the
#@ bundle `CVE\_2023\_26560` is added to the /bundlesequence/. This example
#@ illustrates augments settings (`def.json` in the root of your policy set) for
#@ manual integration and execution.
#@
#@ ```json
#@ {
#@ "inputs": [ "./services/CVE\_2023\_26560.cf" ],
#@ "vars": {
#@ "control\_common\_bundlesequence\_end": [ "CVE\_2023\_26560" ]
#@ }
#@ }
#@ ````
#@
#@ The policy has been designed to limit resource utilization, and is safe to
#@ leave active if desired (though not required). When remediation occurs, the
#@ file `CVE\_2023\_26560\_remediated` will be present in state. A date stamp is added
#@ to the file each time remediation occurs, though only a single remediation is
#@ expected.
#@
#@ \*\*Single execution instructions\*\*
#@
#@ If you do not wish to integrate this policy into your larger policy set, you
#@ can instead execute it manually as a standalone policy file. The following
#@ examples show executing the standalone policy.
#@
#@ - `chmod 700 ./CVE\_2023\_26560.cf && ./CVE\_2023\_26560.cf --bundlesequence CVE\_2023\_26560`
#@ - `cf-agent -Kf ./CVE\_2023\_26560.cf --bundlesequence CVE\_2023\_26560`

body classes results(scope, class\_prefix)
# @brief Define classes prefixed with `class\_prefix` and suffixed with
# appropriate outcomes: \_kept, \_repaired, \_not\_kept, \_error, \_failed,
# \_denied, \_timeout, \_reached
#
# @param scope The scope in which the class should be defined (`bundle` or `namespace`)
# @param class\_prefix The prefix for the classes defined
#
# This body can be applied to any promise and sets global
# (`namespace`) or local (`bundle`) classes based on its outcome. For
# instance, with `class\_prefix` set to `abc`:
#
# \* if the promise is to change a file's owner to `nick` and the file
# was already owned by `nick`, the classes `abc\_reached` and
# `abc\_kept` will be set.
#
# \* if the promise is to change a file's owner to `nick` and the file
# was owned by `adam` and the change succeeded, the classes
# `abc\_reached` and `abc\_repaired` will be set.
#
# This body is a simpler, more consistent version of the body
# `scoped\_classes\_generic`, which see. The key difference is that
# fewer classes are defined, and only for outcomes that we can know.
# For example this body does not define "OK/not OK" outcome classes,
# since a promise can be both kept and failed at the same time.
#
# It's important to understand that promises may do multiple things,
# so a promise is not simply "OK" or "not OK." The best way to
# understand what will happen when your specific promises get this
# body is to test it in all the possible combinations.
#
# \*\*Suffix Notes:\*\*
#
# \* `\_reached` indicates the promise was tried. Any outcome will result
# in a class with this suffix being defined.
#
# \* `\_kept` indicates some aspect of the promise was kept
#
# \* `\_repaired` indicates some aspect of the promise was repaired
#
# \* `\_not\_kept` indicates some aspect of the promise was not kept.
# error, failed, denied and timeout outcomes will result in a class
# with this suffix being defined
#
# \* `\_error` indicates the promise repair encountered an error
#
# \* `\_failed` indicates the promise failed
#
# \* `\_denied` indicates the promise repair was denied
#
# \* `\_timeout` indicates the promise timed out
#
# \*\*Example:\*\*
#
# ```cf3
# bundle agent example
# {
# commands:
# "/bin/true"
# classes => results("bundle", "my\_class\_prefix");
#
# reports:
# my\_class\_prefix\_kept::
# "My promise was kept";

We are writing to inform you about a security issue that was discovered in CFEngine 3.6.0 and later versions.
Our development team found the vulnerabiliy relating to inadequate access control / unauthorized access to system files.
MITRE assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-26560.
We have no indications that this vulnerability has been used or known outside of the CFEngine development team.

## Explanation

The issue is that Mission Portal users can access certain files through scheduled reports, as these reports are run with elevated privileges, without additional checks to limit what can be queried.
Within SQL queries (in PostgreSQL) you can use functions like `pg_read_binary_file` to access files on the file system.
This issue is limited to scheduled reports, due to the different context where those queries are run.

## Impact

Using scheduled reports and PostgreSQL functions like `pg_read_binary_file`, Mission Portal users can read files they should not have access to, such as database contents from `/var/cfengine/state/pg/data/`, logs and other files which the `cfpostgres` system user has access to.
It should be noted that the user needs access to scheduled reports and this is not enabled by default when creating new users.
The concern is around non-admin users which have been granted permission to use scheduled reports through the **RBAC settings**.
The database files could allow someone to restore the database, and among other things, get access to:

* Information about hosts they should not see due to RBAC filtering.
* The LDAP username and password used in settings to set up LDAP authentication (if this feature is used).
* Usernames and password hashes for all (non LDAP) Mission Portal users.

## Remediation

We recommend installing one of the new versions of the CFEngine hub packages listed [on our download pages](https://cfengine.com/downloads/cfengine-enterprise/), as well as rotating users’ passwords and CFEngine secrets.
The newly released CFEngine 3.18.4 and 3.21.1 versions contain only fixes for the mentioned issue, and thus should be non-problematic to install on top of CFEngine 3.18.3 or 3.21.1.
If you have LDAP configured, please also rotate the LDAP user password you have in the **Authentication settings**.
For your information, we do not store Mission Portal users’ raw passwords, they are hashed.

Note that since this issue only affects the CFEngine Enterprise hub, installing the hub package is enough to remediate the issue.
Pay attention to the upgrade instructions, especially if you are upgrading from a version older than 3.18.3, as you should first upgrade your policy set.

### Workaround / hotfix

In the case where updating hub packages is not possible, you can use this hotfix.
The hotfix restricts access to the affected files and rotates secrets.

<https://cfengine.com/blog/2023/hotfix-CVE-2023-26560-v1.0.0.cf>

However, we would like to make you aware that after applying the hotfix, the root database user will no longer be able to make schema changes to the database.
This is because the hotfix removes the superuser role from it.
But you can still manage the database under the `cfpostgres` user.
