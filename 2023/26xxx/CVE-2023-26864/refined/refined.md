- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SmplTools::getMatchingRedirectionsFromParts()` method in the Redirections Manager module contains a SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in SQL queries. Specifically, the `str_querystring` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, leading to a blind SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection (CWE-89). The module doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input used in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to alter the shop's database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of records, or complete compromise of the database. The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via a network attack. A trivial HTTP call can trigger the vulnerable code. The large scope of URL exposed increases the risk, especially if patterns are whitelisted by a WAF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are required for successful exploitation. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected system.
