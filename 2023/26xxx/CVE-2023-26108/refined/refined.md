Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `StreamableFile` objects were handled in the NestJS framework when using the Express adapter.  Specifically, the `pipe()` method was used to transfer the stream from the `StreamableFile` to the Express response, which does not handle stream closures properly in case of errors or premature client disconnection, leading to resource leaks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Resource Leak:**  When a client cancels a request while a `StreamableFile` is being streamed, the underlying stream wrapped by `StreamableFile` is not properly closed, resulting in a resource leak.  This could include open file handles, network connections, or other resources held by the underlying stream.
- **Improper Stream Handling:** The use of the deprecated `pipe()` method, instead of the recommended `pipeline()` method, which automatically closes source stream on destination stream error, was the primary cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated client cancellations of streamed files can cause resource exhaustion on the server, leading to a denial-of-service. This can happen if the server's pool of resources, such as sockets when streaming from an external source, become "poisoned" due to leaked streams.
- **Potential Server Hang:** In the reported case with a S3 client, leaked sockets in the connection pool caused all S3 calls to hang, requiring a server restart to recover.
- **Information Exposure:**  Although the vulnerability is primarily a resource leak, the Snyk report also categorizes it as Information Exposure, likely because the unclosed streams could potentially leak sensitive data held within if they are not properly disposed of.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
- **Client-Initiated Cancellation:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating a request for a `StreamableFile` and then prematurely canceling the request by closing the client connection or aborting the download.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable NestJS application.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server, including the ability to cancel the requests mid-stream.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authorization or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `@nestjs/core` versions prior to 9.0.5.
- The fix involves replacing the use of `.pipe()` with `pipeline()` in the Express adapter.  This ensures that the underlying streams are properly closed in case of errors or premature termination.
- The fix also includes an error handler for `StreamableFile` to return a 400 status code by default, but this can be customized.
- The fix is specific to the Express adapter because the Fastify adapter handles streams internally.
