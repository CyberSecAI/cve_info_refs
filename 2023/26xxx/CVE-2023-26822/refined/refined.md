Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `soapcgi.main` function of the D-Link Go-RT-AC750 router. The `service` parameter from the URL is directly incorporated into a format string using `sprintf` which then passed to the `system` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `service` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the command injection flaw. The `system` function executes the generated string as a shell command, which allows for arbitrary commands execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `service` parameter before using it in the `sprintf` function, leading to the injection.
*   **Use of `system` Function:** The usage of `system` function with user-controlled input is inherently dangerous and facilitates command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Full Control of the Router:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the device.
*   **Network Compromise:** This can lead to the compromise of the local network the router is connected to.
*   **Data Theft, Malware Installation, and Denial of Service:** These are potential malicious activities that can follow, depending on the attacker's motives.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/soap.cgi` endpoint of the router. The malicious commands are embedded within the `service` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the D-Link Go-RT-AC750 router. This could be from the local network or, if the router's management interface is exposed, from the internet.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `/soap.cgi` endpoint and the format of the HTTP request that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker should be able to construct and send the malicious HTTP request containing the injected command.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Product:** D-Link Go-RT-AC750
