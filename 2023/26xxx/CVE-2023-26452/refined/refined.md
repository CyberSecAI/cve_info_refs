Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Imageconverter service. Specifically, requests to cache an image and return its metadata could be manipulated to include arbitrary SQL queries. These queries are then executed without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data when constructing SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject their own malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements within the context of the service's database user account. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially leading to a full compromise of the service and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the adjacent network where the Imageconverter service is running. This service is not exposed to public networks by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Imageconverter service.
- **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located at the `cacheAndGetImageAndMetadata` endpoint of the Imageconverter API.
- The vulnerability is considered critical, with a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.6.
- The fix involves sanitizing and validating the API requests to prevent SQL injection.
- The vulnerability affects OX App Suite office versions 7.10.6-rev5 and 8.12. It was fixed in versions 7.10.6-rev6 and 8.13.
