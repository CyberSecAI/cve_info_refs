The provided content relates to CVE-2023-26234.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of Java objects within the `InterProcessCommunicationUtil` class. Specifically, when the `singleInstance` configuration is enabled, the application listens on port 20156 for serialized objects. An attacker can send a malicious serialized object, which, when deserialized, leads to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization of Java objects
- Lack of proper input validation/filtering of deserialized objects
- Use of a vulnerable version of Java (JDK 8u20/7u21) which allows for gadget chains.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the machine running the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a malicious serialized Java object to the application listening on port 20156.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to port 20156 of the machine running the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to have access to a serialized payload crafted using a gadget chain suitable for the targeted Java version.
- The attacker needs to configure the application to use the single instance config setting (this may be required or an option)

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the `UIMainWindowPreferencesProvider.singleInstance` configuration is enabled.
- The vulnerability is reproducible when using JDK 8u20/7u21, due to known deserialization gadget chains that can be exploited using these versions.
- The fix implements a `resolveClass` method that only allows `String[]` to be deserialized, blocking other malicious object types.
- The CVSS score of 6.6 is mentioned which is Moderate severity.
- The github issues #415 and #416, and the pull request #417 are mentioned. Issue #415 is the security issue related to this CVE and #417 is the PR that fixes it.
