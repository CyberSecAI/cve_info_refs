| Are you saying it doesn't make any sense because you can achieve the same thing using the search path?  I'm not totally against breaking backwards compatibility, but then this should happen with a deprecation warning and in the next release. Not sure if we'd even have to go for a new major version then, i.e. version 4.x. |

| Are you saying it doesn't make any sense because you can achieve the same thing using the search path?  Yes.  +1 for a deprecation warning.  -1 for a new major version. We've made much bigger backward-incompatible changes that justified a new major version. Not on the API level but on the table format level. This change to the API is insignificant compared to those. |

| Well, strictly speaking we are removing some functionality from the public API (as far as I know). And if we claim to do [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), then I guess we should increase the major version. |

| I don't think we (claim to) do semantic versioning. Because it does not make sense to declare an API that does not include the table format in my opinion, and because we've made several backwards incompatible changes to the table format, I can only conclude that we are not pretending to do semantic versioning.  P.S.: We can always change this of course. But that also means precisely documenting the table format, and that happens to be one of the things we struggle with a lot. |

| When long path is given to API `lou_setDataPath()`, there will be a global-buffer-overflow.  Similar to [#1291](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/1291), because liblouis does not check the input length.     [liblouis/liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/blob/63722f0428cd4e98d7446658162fb71732d892bb/liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c#L58-L62)  Lines 58 to 62 in [63722f0](/liblouis/liblouis/commit/63722f0428cd4e98d7446658162fb71732d892bb)   |  | lou\_setDataPath(const char \*path) { | | --- | --- | |  | static char dataPath[MAXSTRING]; | |  | dataPathPtr = NULL; | |  | if (path == NULL) return NULL; | |  | strcpy(dataPath, path); |     Test Environment Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS liblouis (master, [6223f21](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/commit/6223f2134b2d817c6e16fa6ddf3a019fa28c1cd9)) How to trigger  1.

| Thanks for the report. I think we should consider dropping lou\_setDataPath as it seems redundant. |
