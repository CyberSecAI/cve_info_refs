Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros` features in XWiki, which incorrectly allow filtering based on password fields. This allows an attacker to query for users by parts of their password hashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically password hashes, through the `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros` endpoints. These endpoints were not intended to allow filtering on password fields.
*   **Insecure Filtering:** The live table functionality does not properly restrict filtering on password fields, enabling an attacker to progressively reveal the full password hash through a series of queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Hash Exposure:** An attacker can reconstruct full password hashes by repeatedly querying the vulnerable endpoints with incremental parts of the hash.
*   **Offline Password Cracking:** Once the password hash is known, it can be used in offline attacks (e.g., dictionary attacks) to attempt to recover the original password.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Successful offline cracking can lead to the compromise of user accounts, potentially giving attackers access to sensitive data and functionalities within the XWiki platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros` endpoints.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker directly interacts with these endpoints by crafting specific URLs with filter parameters targeting the password fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the XWiki instance where the vulnerable endpoints are exposed.
*   **Basic Knowledge of XWiki:** The attacker requires knowledge of the parameters and structure of the `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros` endpoints to craft the malicious requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication to the XWiki platform.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attack is performed by using the `password` parameter in the request with a specific format like `password=hash:SHA-512:<hash_fragment>`.
*   The attacker makes requests filtering for incremental password hash characters and combines results to reconstruct the hash.
*   Originally, the issue required an average of 1536 requests, but optimized attacks using "OR" conditions can extract the hash with around 768 requests, and potentially as few as 384 for a successful attack on a weak password.
*   The fix involves adding a check in `LiveTableResultsMacros.xml` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros.xml` to skip filtering on fields of type 'Password'.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions >= 3.2-m3.
*   Patched versions are 14.7-rc-1, 13.4.4, and 13.10.9.
*   The issue does not apply to users from external authentication systems.
*   The associated CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2023-26476.
*   The CWE is CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
