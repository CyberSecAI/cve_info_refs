- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed but the CVSS vector indicates local access with user interaction required, suggesting the vulnerability could be triggered by opening a malicious file or through other user driven actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to get a user to interact with a specially crafted file or trigger the vulnerability through other means within the application. User interaction is required, and the attacker does not need special privileges on the local machine.
