Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26488

**Root Cause:** The `ERC721Consecutive` contract, designed for minting NFTs in batches, fails to correctly update token balances when minting a batch of size 1 (a single token).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect balance update in `ERC721Consecutive` contract when minting a batch of size 1.
- The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function in `ERC721` was previously handling balance updates when batchSize > 1, and this logic was removed. Extensions that relied on this behavior are now broken.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Subsequent transfers of the single token can cause the `balanceOf` function to report an incorrect (overflowed) balance for the receiver. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications relying on accurate balance tracking.
- Erroneous balances may be displayed by applications that query them
- The issue presents itself only when batch size equals 1.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by minting a batch of one token using the `_mintConsecutive` function in the `ERC721Consecutive` contract.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to call the `_mintConsecutive` function, typically being a contract owner or having the appropriate permissions.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`  `>=4.8.0` and `<4.8.2`.
- The issue was patched in version `4.8.2`.
- The fix involved modifying `ERC721` and `ERC721Consecutive`.
    -  `ERC721._beforeTokenTransfer` no longer updates balances.
    -  `ERC721Consecutive` now calls `__unsafe_increaseBalance` to update balances.
- The fix includes a breaking change: The internal `_beforeTokenTransfer` function in `ERC721` no longer updates balances. Extensions now have to call `__unsafe_increaseBalance` explicitly.
- New tests were added to `ERC721Consecutive.t.sol` to verify the fix and ensure single mints are handled correctly.
