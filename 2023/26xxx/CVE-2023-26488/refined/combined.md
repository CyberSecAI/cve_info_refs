# ERC721Consecutive incorrect balance update with batch of 1

Moderate

GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q
Mar 2, 2023

## Package

npm

@openzeppelin/contracts
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=4.8.0 <4.8.2

## Patched versions

([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

>=4.8.0 <4.8.2

4.8.2

## Description

### Impact

The ERC721Consecutive contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does not update balances when a batch has size 1 and consists of a single token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may overflow the balance as reported by `balanceOf`.

The issue exclusively presents with batches of size 1.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in 4.8.2.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-26488

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

|  |  | # Changelog |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 4.8.2 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - `ERC721Consecutive`: Fixed a bug when `\_mintConsecutive` is used for batches of size 1 that could lead to balance overflow. Refer to the breaking changes section in the changelog for a note on the behavior of `ERC721.\_beforeTokenTransfer`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Breaking changes |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - `ERC721`: The internal function `\_beforeTokenTransfer` no longer updates balances, which it previously did when `batchSize` was greater than 1. This change has no consequence unless a custom ERC721 extension is explicitly invoking `\_beforeTokenTransfer`. Balance updates in extensions must now be done explicitly using `\_\_unsafe\_increaseBalance`, with a name that indicates that there is an invariant that has to be manually verified. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 4.8.1 (2023-01-13) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `ERC4626`: Use staticcall instead of call when fetching underlying ERC-20 decimals. ([#3943](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3943)) |

> **Note**
>
> This release contains a fix for [GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q "GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q").

* `ERC721Consecutive`: Fixed a bug when `_mintConsecutive` is used for batches of size 1 that could lead to balance overflow. Refer to the breaking changes section in the changelog for a note on the behavior of `ERC721._beforeTokenTransfer`.

### Breaking changes

* `ERC721`: The internal function `_beforeTokenTransfer` no longer updates balances, which it previously did when `batchSize` was greater than 1. This change has no consequence unless a custom ERC721 extension is explicitly invoking `_beforeTokenTransfer`. Balance updates in extensions must now be done explicitly using `__unsafe_increaseBalance`, with a name that indicates that there is an invariant that has to be manually verified.
