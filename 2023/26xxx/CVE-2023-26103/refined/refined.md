  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `upgradeWebSocket` function in the `deno` package uses regular expressions `/s*,s*/` to split the `Connection` and `Upgrade` headers. These regexes are vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted `Connection` or `Upgrade` header can be sent to a web socket server, causing it to slow down significantly due to the regex engine's excessive backtracking. This results in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted `Connection` or `Upgrade` header via HTTP request to a web server using the vulnerable `deno` package."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running the vulnerable `deno` package and control the content of the `Connection` and `Upgrade` headers. No special privileges or user interaction are required."

  "resolution": "Upgrade `deno` to version 1.31.0 or higher. The vulnerable regex was replaced with `String.prototype.trim()`, which does not suffer from catastrophic backtracking."
