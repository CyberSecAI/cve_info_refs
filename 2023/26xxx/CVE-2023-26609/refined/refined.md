Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-26609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from two distinct issues:
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  A flaw in the `/cgi-bin/admin/fileread` endpoint allows reading arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A command injection vulnerability exists in the `/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft` endpoint, enabling execution of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **LFI:** The `/cgi-bin/admin/fileread` endpoint lacks proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to specify any file path to be read.
*   **RCE:** The `/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft` endpoint improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing command injection. The parameter `ap` is used as an injection point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can read any file on the system, including sensitive configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/boa.conf`). This could expose credentials and other sensitive information.
*   **RCE:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with root privileges. This enables them to take full control of the device.
*   **SSH Root Access:** By exploiting the RCE, an attacker can further gain persistent remote root access to the device by manipulating the dropbear SSH daemon, creating SSH keys, adding a user to the password file and starting the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** By sending an HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=[filename]` with a chosen file path.
*   **RCE:** By sending an HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=irrelevant;[command]` with a command to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
*   Knowledge of default credentials might be required in some instances (e.g., `admin:admin` or `manufacture:erutcafunam`). However, even without default credentials the LFI can be exploited and the RCE can be triggered, although the exploitation may require additional steps in the absence of default credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable devices are ABUS Security Cameras, specifically tested on the models TVIP 20000-21150. However, it is stated that other models may also be vulnerable.
*   The device runs on GM ARM Linux 2.6 with a Boa/0.94.14rc21 web server.
*   The provided PoC scripts demonstrates how to exploit both LFI and RCE.
*   The exploit author used the "living off the land" (LOLBIN) approach to achieve persistent remote root access via SSH, by leveraging the existing `dropbear` SSH daemon.
*   The attacker can bypass authentication to trigger the RCE or LFI by using the default credentials `manufacture:erutcafunam`.
