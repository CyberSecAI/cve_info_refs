{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly incorporates user-controlled input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete database takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/index.php/author/comment` endpoint with a malicious `time` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application. No prior authentication seems to be needed."
