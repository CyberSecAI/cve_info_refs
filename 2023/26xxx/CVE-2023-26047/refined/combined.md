# Bypass of IE Octal/Hex/Unicode Entities Detection in Common Web Attack Threat Rule with Case-Sensitive Entities Payload and Special Characters

Moderate

[dwisiswant0](/dwisiswant0)
published
GHSA-p2pf-g8cq-3gq5
Mar 1, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<v0.2.0

## Patched versions

v0.2.0

## Description

### Description

teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version v0.2.0 is vulnerable to a bypass attack when a specific case-sensitive hex entities payload with special characters such as CR/LF and horizontal tab is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application.

### Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions.

### Patches

Version [v0.2.0](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/releases/tag/v0.2.0) includes a patch for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

We advised updating their installations to version v0.2.0 and frontwards immediately.

### Credits

This vulnerability was reported by Aidil Arief ([@aidilarf](https://github.com/aidilarf)), a security researcher who discovered and reported the vulnerability to teler-waf developers. Their efforts have contributed to the improvement of teler-waf development.

```
Modified the regular expression rule for handling escape characters by
adding the case-insensitive `(?i)` flag to the rule. This change ensures
that the regular expression will match escape characters regardless of
their case, making the rule more flexible and accommodating a larger
range of possibilities.
