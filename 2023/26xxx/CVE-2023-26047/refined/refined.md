Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way `teler-waf`, a Go HTTP middleware, handles case-sensitive hex entities payloads, particularly when they include special characters like CR/LF and horizontal tabs. The web application firewall (WAF) failed to properly detect these encoded payloads, allowing them to bypass the intended threat rules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Bypass of threat rules:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass common web attack threat rules due to the case-sensitive nature of the hex entity detection and the presence of special characters.
*   **Insufficient input validation:**  The WAF lacks robust input validation, specifically regarding the handling of encoded characters that can be interpreted differently by browsers.
*   **Case-sensitive regex:** The initial regex used for detecting these entities was case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass it with variations in the case of the characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:**  The injected JavaScript code executes in the victim's browser.
*   **Data compromise:** Attackers can steal sensitive information like login credentials, session tokens, or other user data.
*   **Browser control:** Attackers could take control of the victim's browser to perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests that contain the specially crafted, case-sensitive hex entities payload with special characters.
*   **Web application input fields:** Attackers can inject the malicious payloads through any input field that is processed by the vulnerable web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of payload encoding:** The attacker must be aware of the specific encoding bypass technique using case-sensitive hex entities with special characters.
*   **No special privileges needed:** The attack can be launched by any user able to send HTTP requests to the target application.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to `teler-waf` versions prior to `v0.2.0`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `v0.2.0`.
*   The fix involved making the regex used to detect these entities case-insensitive.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page) and CWE-692 (Incomplete Processing of Security-Relevant Inputs)
