Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26056:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check within the XWiki Context Macro. It fails to verify if a user has the necessary script rights when executing macros within a specific context. The `context` macro, combined with the `async` macro, allows executing macros as another user without programming rights, provided that the target user has authored at least one document accessible by the current user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The core issue is the lack of a proper check for script rights within the Context Macro. The macro only checks for programming rights but not for script rights, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Context Manipulation:** The Context macro allows to execute content under the context of another user.
- **Unrestricted Macro Execution:** When combined with the async macro, it bypasses security checks and allows executing arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can execute code with the script rights of another user, potentially gaining higher access to the system. This can lead to executing scripts as a user who has script rights but not programming rights.
- **Impersonation:** An attacker can modify the content of documents belonging to other users, with the changes appearing to be made by the impersonated user, leading to content manipulation. An attacker could potentially gain full admin rights of the impersonated user.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access documents that they wouldn't normally have access to, revealing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Macro Injection:** Attackers inject malicious macros using the `context` and `async` macros within a document or user profile.
- **HTML Converter:** Attackers can also trigger the vulnerability through the HTML Converter by crafting specific URLs, this bypasses the need to create a document containing malicious macros.
- **Guest User:** Even a guest user might be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to XWiki:** The attacker needs access to an XWiki instance.
- **Document Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a document (or their user profile), injecting the malicious macro code.
- **Knowledge of Document References:** The attacker needs to know the document reference of a user with script rights but not programming rights, and that is accessible to the attacker.
- **No programming rights:** The attacker themselves doesn't need programming rights.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in XWiki versions 14.8-rc-1, 14.4.5, and 13.10.10.
- There is no workaround for this issue other than upgrading.
- The vulnerability is related to the implementation of the `context` macro, and how it interacts with the `async` macro when switching execution contexts.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
