Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-supplied input, specifically within the "User Name" parameter of the Park Ticketing Management System. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability in the application. The application does not sanitize or validate user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the system's dashboard.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker can enumerate user names, personal information, and app functionality.
*   **Account Takeover:** Complete account takeover is possible, indicating a high severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The "User Name" parameter of the login form/authentication page.
*   **Technique:** SQL injection is performed by injecting malicious SQL code within the vulnerable input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions a video PoC (Proof of Concept), but the link isn't provided.
*   The content suggests mitigations such as using a Web Application Firewall (WAF), input validation, parameterized queries, prepared statements, and limiting verbose error messages, indicating an awareness of common SQL injection prevention techniques.
*   The version mentioned is 1.0.
