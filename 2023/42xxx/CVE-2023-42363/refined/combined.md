The affected component is xfuncs_printf.c:344 in xasprintf function. Following is the reproduction process, and we put the poc file in the attachment. [1.] Environment Ubuntu 18.04, 64 bit BusyBox 1.36.1 Clang 6.0.0  [2.] Compilation 2.1 Modify the Makefile: HOSTCC=clang -fsanitize=address HOSTCXX=clang++ -fsanitize=address CC=clang CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address CPPFLAGS=-fsanitize=address LDFLAGS="-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition" 2.2 Modify the Config.in file, switch the following configs to y： DEBUG: y DEBUG_PESSIMIZE: y FEATURE_CLEAN_UP: y DEBUG_SANITIZE: y 2.3 Commands for compilation: export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 make defconfig make install  [3.] Reproduction export ASAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=1 symbolize=0"

2024-01-25 01:21:25 UTC  ``` The relevant part of input that triggers the problem seems to be lines 17 and 18. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=15865#c3)  Valery Ushakov    2024-01-31 01:44:49 UTC  ``` So, the bug is triggered by lines 17 and 18 in the input, b/c the END rule is mangled by the fuzzer to have weird code where collected languages are processed.  Line 128 of the mangled awk program is:    macros[i] = "CL_" langs[i], gsub( "[^A-Za-z0-9_]", "X", macros[i] )  and all awks reject that use of comma as a syntax error, but busybox awk accepts it.  As far as I can tell, this bug can be reproduced with something like:    $ awk 'BEGIN { v = "abc", gsub("b", "X", v); print v }'   aXc  (use asan/valgrind to taste). ``` |  |
