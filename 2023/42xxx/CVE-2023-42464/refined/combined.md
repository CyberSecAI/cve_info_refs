Package        : netatalk
Version        : 3.1.12~ds-3+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-42464
Debian Bug     : 1052087

Florent Saudel and Arnaud Gatignol discovered a Type Confusion
vulnerability in the Spotlight RPC functions in afpd in Netatalk. When
parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value
style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can
be any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of
type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which
returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to
fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote
Code Execution on the host.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
3.1.12~ds-3+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian Bug     : 1051066

Multiple security issues were discovered in Netatalk, an implementation
of the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) for offering file service (mainly) to
macOS clients, which may result in the execution of arbitrary code or
information disclosure.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.1.12~ds-8+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk packages.

# Netatalk Security Advisory

**Subject**
afpd daemon vulnerable to type confusion
**CVE ID**
[CVE-2023-42464](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42464)
**Date of Publishing**
2023/09/17
**Affected Netatalk Versions**
3.1.0 - 3.1.16
**Summary**
A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in Netatalk's afpd daemon.
## Description

A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in Netatalk's afpd daemon.
When parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary
where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the underlying protocol.
Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc\_value\_for\_key() function,
which returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to fully control
the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host.

The underlying code for Spotlight queries in Netatalk shares a common heritage with Samba,
and hence the root cause and fix are logically identical with those described in CVE-2023-34967.

The vulnerable code was introduced in Netatalk 3.1.0, together with the Spotlight feature.

## Patch Availability

Apply the patch with git hash
[a0ee3c2](https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/commit/a0ee3c246ee9e082436192290610a4d812fc0b7f.diff) to hotfix your local Netatalk deployment.

Additionally, Netatalk 3.1.17 has been released which contains the security patch.
Netatalk administrators are advised to upgrade to this version or apply the patch as soon as possible.

## CVSS Calculation

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L (5.3)

## Workaround

Spotlight is an optional feature in Netatalk, and is disabled by default.
If you previously enabled Spotlight and want to disable it, set "spotlight = no" in your afp.conf.

| A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in Netatalk's afpd daemon. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc\_value\_for\_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host.  The underlying code for Spotlight queries in Netatalk shares a common heritage with Samba, and hence the root cause and fix are logically identical with those described in [CVE-2023-34967](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-86p4-vhr6-2vv3 "CVE-2023-34967").  All versions of Netatalk from 3.1.0 through 3.1.16 are potentially vulnerable to this exploit.  The vulnerability is patched as of Netatalk 3.1.17.  Credits to finding and demonstrating the exploit goes to: Florent Saudel, Arnaud Gatignol of @thalium\_team |
