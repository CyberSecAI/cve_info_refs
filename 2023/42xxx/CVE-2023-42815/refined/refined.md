  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Notary verifier in Kyverno did not properly limit the amount of data it would process when fetching signatures, specifically referrers and signature blobs from a registry. An attacker controlling the registry could send a large number of referrers or a large signature blob which would lead to a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation and resource limits"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) of Kyverno, preventing other users' admission requests from being processed.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs control over the registry from which Kyverno fetches signatures/attestations.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Control over the registry from which Kyverno fetches signatures."

  "fixes": [

      "changes": [
         "Added `maxReferrersCount` constant to limit the number of referrers processed.",
         "Added `maxPayloadSize` constant to limit the size of the signature blob payload.",
         "Implemented checks to limit the number of signatures fetched in ListSignatures.",
         "Implemented a check to limit the max signature size in FetchSignatureBlob."
