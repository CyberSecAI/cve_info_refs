Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-42787:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content, especially the Fortinet advisory and the GitHub security advisory, directly references CVE-2023-42787 and describes a vulnerability related to Fortinet FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer. This confirms that the content is directly relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The core issue is a **client-side enforcement of server-side security vulnerability** (CWE-602). This means the application relies on client-side code (like JavaScript) to enforce security policies, which can be bypassed by manipulating that client-side code or the server responses before they reach the client. 
   - Specifically, the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer web interfaces lack proper server-side access controls and permission checks related to the JSConsole.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insufficient Server-Side Control:** The application does not adequately validate user permissions on the server-side before allowing access to sensitive functionalities (JSConsole).
   - **Lack of Permission Control:** Sensitive commands within the JSConsole that should only be available to high-privileged users are not correctly restricted for low-privileged users.
   - **Client-Side Vulnerability:** The JSConsole is made accessible via client-side JavaScript or by manipulating server responses before they reach the browser, making client side code execution possible.
   - **Bypassing ADOM segmentation:** The vulnerability allows users to bypass the intended ADOM (Administrative Domain) segmentation, allowing access to information that should be limited to their specific ADOM.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Unauthorized Access:** Low-privileged users can gain access to the JSConsole/CLI console, which they are normally not authorized to use.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Low-privileged users can execute commands to enumerate and retrieve sensitive configuration data, including encrypted passwords and certificates, for *all* registered FortiGate devices, irrespective of ADOM assignments.
     - This allows for unauthorized viewing of potentially sensitive configuration details.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Web Interface Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer web interface either through:
        - JavaScript injection/execution from the browser, 
        - Manipulation of server responses before they are processed by the client, via a local proxy.
   - **Exploitation of JSConsole Commands:** Low-privileged users can execute specific, insufficiently controlled JSConsole commands to obtain the configurations.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account within the affected FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer instance (e.g., a "read-only user" with limited permissions).
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer web interface.
   - **Web Browser and/or Proxy Tools** : The attacker needs to use a web browser and optionally use a web proxy tool to manipulate server responses and trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
 - The vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity by Fortinet.
 - The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 6.2.
- The Github advisory provides a concise description of the vulnerability and links to the Fortinet advisory. It also references the vulnerable software version and fixed version information.
- The Orange Cyberdefense content mentions "security researchers Mickael Dorigny at Orange Cyberdéfense, Hélène Saliou, Frédéric Prevost, François-Xavier Picard and Orange CERT-CC at Orange group for discovering and reporting this vulnerability under responsible disclosure."

In summary, CVE-2023-42787 allows an attacker with minimal access to gain extensive visibility over the entire infrastructure managed by FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer due to a flawed client-side security mechanism, coupled with insufficient access control on the server-side and sensitive commands.
