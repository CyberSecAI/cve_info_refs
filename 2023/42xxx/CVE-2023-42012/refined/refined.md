- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) Agent installed as a Windows service in a non-standard location is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of service installation locations, specifically when an agent is not installed in the standard location. This allows local users to potentially interfere with the service's operation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can cause a denial of service, disrupting the normal operation of the UCD agent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local, requiring a user with local access to the Windows machine where the vulnerable UCD agent is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable UCD agent is installed. They must also be aware that the UCD agent is installed in a non-standard location.
