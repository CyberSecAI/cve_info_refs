{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cleartext transmission of the Wi-Fi password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Shelly TRV device transmits the Wi-Fi password in cleartext.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can obtain the Wi-Fi password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local network access is required to intercept the cleartext transmission of the Wi-Fi password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same local network as the Shelly TRV device and capable of capturing network traffic."
