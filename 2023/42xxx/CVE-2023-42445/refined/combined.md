This is a patch release for 7.6. We recommend using 7.6.3 instead of 7.6.

This release addresses two security vulnerabilities:

* [Incorrect permission assignment for symlinked files used in copy or archiving operations](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-43r3-pqhv-f7h9)
* [Possible local text file exfiltration by XML External entity injection](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-mrff-q8qj-xvg8)

It also fixes the following issues:

* [#25781](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25781) Backport finalized task performance fix to 7.6.x
* [#25802](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25802) Backport cgroups fix to 7.6.x

[Read the Release Notes](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/release-notes.html)

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 7.6.3 by updating your wrapper:

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=7.6.3

```

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_7.6) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle 7.6.3.

# Possible local text file exfiltration by XML External entity injection

Moderate

[ljacomet](/ljacomet)
published
GHSA-mrff-q8qj-xvg8
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

Gradle
(Java)

## Affected versions

<7.6.3, <8.4

## Patched versions

7.6.3, 8.4

## Description

### Impact

This is a XML external entities (XXE) vulnerability. See [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) and [OWASP XXE](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing).

In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server.

Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle.

Impacted use-cases in the Gradle Build Tool:

| Use case | Vulnerable | Exploitable remotely |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ivy descriptor parsing | YES | YES |
| Maven POM parsing | NO | NO |
| Maven Toolchains discovery | YES | NO |
| Generation of Ivy and Maven metadata for publishing | YES | NO |
| Dependency Verification metadata | NO | NO |
| EAR deployment descriptor parsing | YES | NO |
| IntelliJ, Eclipse, VisualStudio, xcode file generation | YES | NO |

In the use-cases above, only Ivy descriptor parsing is exploitable remotely. This would require an attacker to have control over an Ivy repository used by your build or be able to publish a malicious Ivy descriptor to a repository your build uses for a dependency you use.

Other use-cases are either not exploitable because existing measures protect from the XXE vulnerability or are only exploitable from local files. An attacker would need to modify your build or local build tool configuration files to exploit the XXE vulnerability.

Note that the IDE files generation related use cases only refer to using the relative Gradle plugins to generate their configuration. Project import in IntelliJ, Android Studio or Eclipse are not impacted.

### Patches

In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML external entities.

It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.3 or 8.4, you can disable resolving XML external entities by setting [JAXP](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/security/java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-D97A1F1D-8DDF-4D19-A7E5-99099F27346E) system properties.

This can be done on the command line by adding the following:

```
-Djavax.xml.accessExternalDTD=false -Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=false -Djavax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=false

```

This can be made persistent by adding the following lines in a `gradle.properties` file:

```
systemProps.javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=false
systemProps.javax.xml.accessExternalSchema=false
systemProps.javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=false

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
