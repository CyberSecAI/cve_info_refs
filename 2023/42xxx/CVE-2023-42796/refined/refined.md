- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server in the CPCI85 firmware of SICAM A8000 CP-8031 and CP-8050 fails to properly sanitize user input for the `/sicweb-ajax/tmproot/` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated remote attacker can traverse directories, download arbitrary files, and potentially escalate privileges to the administrator role by exploring active session IDs.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is accessible remotely through the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web server.
