The provided content relates to CVE-2023-42769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient length of the cookie session ID. This allows an attacker to potentially brute-force the session ID, bypass authentication, and manipulate the transmitter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The cookie session ID is too short, which can be exploited to obtain a valid session, bypass authentication and manipulate the transmitter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain control of the transmitter.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation via network access.
*   Brute-force attack on the session cookie ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network access to the affected device.
*   Ability to perform brute-force attacks.
