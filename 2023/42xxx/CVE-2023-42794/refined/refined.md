- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incomplete refactoring in the internal fork of Commons FileUpload within Apache Tomcat resulted in temporary files not being deleted on Windows if the web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but failed to close it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete cleanup of temporary files, specifically on Windows operating systems. The vulnerability is caused by an unreleased refactoring within the Commons FileUpload library packaged with vulnerable versions of Tomcat.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability can occur as temporary files accumulate and consume disk space, potentially filling the disk and causing the system to become unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to a vulnerable Tomcat server through a web application that opens a stream for an uploaded file and doesn't close it. This could result in rapid accumulation of temporary files on the serverâ€™s disk.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to upload files to a vulnerable Apache Tomcat server through a web application. They need to trigger a code path that opens a stream for the uploaded file, and then fails to close the stream.
