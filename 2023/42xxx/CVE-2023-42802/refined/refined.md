**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unverified object instantiation within the GLPI software. This flaw allows for the upload of malicious PHP files to unintended directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unverified object instantiation leading to arbitrary file upload.
- Improper input validation of file uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Malicious PHP files can be uploaded, and potentially executed on the server.
