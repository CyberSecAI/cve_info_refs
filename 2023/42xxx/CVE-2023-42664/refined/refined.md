- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `uhttpd` service on the TP-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting up the PPTP global configuration. Specifically, the `PPTP Hello Interval` and `PPP Hello Interval` parameters are used as arguments to a shell command without any sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) is present due to the lack of input sanitization of the `pptphellointerval` and `lcpechointerval` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device as root, potentially gaining full control over the router.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=[STOK]/admin/pptp_global?form=global` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator on the device.
