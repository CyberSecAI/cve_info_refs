- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the handling of crafted Bluetooth packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient checks when processing Bluetooth packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to perform a denial-of-service attack.
- **Attack vectors**: Crafted Bluetooth packets sent by an attacker in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in a privileged network position to send the crafted Bluetooth packets.
