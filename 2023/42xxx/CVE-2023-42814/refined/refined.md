{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Notary verifier in Kyverno was vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. By controlling the registry from which Kyverno fetches attestations, an attacker could return a malicious response that would cause Kyverno to stop processing admission requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Kyverno Notary verifier did not implement limits on the size and count of data received from registries.",
       "Lack of input validation on the responses from the image registry"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service of Kyverno, preventing it from processing other users' admission requests. This would effectively block any new resources from being deployed or existing resources from being updated in a Kubernetes cluster.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to control the image registry from which Kyverno fetches attestations.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the image registry. This means they can manipulate the response sent to Kyverno during the attestation fetching process.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found during a security audit. This issue was present in the main branch but not in official releases, and no known exploits in the wild. This vulnerability is due to missing input sanitization and limiting on the response from registries. The fix implements the following mitigations:\n\n*  Setting a maximum limit on the number of referrers.\n*   Adding a limit to the maximum size of the payload.\n*   Adding a maximum count limit on the list of signatures.\n*  Adding a maximum signature size limit in FetchSignatureBlob."
