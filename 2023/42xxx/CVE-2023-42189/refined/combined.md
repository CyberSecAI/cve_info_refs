## Description

![@Agatha2333](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62049491?v=4&size=48)[Agatha2333](https://github.com/Agatha2333)opened [on Aug 13, 2023](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/28679#issue-1848760576)
### Reproduction steps

spec reference: 11.2.9.4. KeySetRemove Command

This command SHALL fail with an INVALID\_COMMAND status code back to the initiator if the

GroupKeySetID being removed is 0, which is the Key Set associated with the Identity Protection Key

(IPK).

KeySetRemove Command field with uint16 type

1. use the chip-tool to send the script

```
chip-tool groupkeymanagement command-by-id 0x03 '{}'

```

### Bug prevalence

NA

### GitHub hash of the SDK that was being used

na

### Platform

other

### Platform Version(s)

NA

### Anything else?

It appears that this script deletes the IPK, which could potentially cause a bug to occur on all genuine devices, such as the Govee Light strip, Nanoleaf Light strip, SwitchBot Hub 2, and EVE Energy Matter devices. Once this script is executed, subsequent scripts may prompt the devices to respond with errors like "Invalid CASE parameter" or "No shared trusted root."

**| Device type | Protocol | Vendor | Error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Smart Plug Mini | Matter over Wifi | Tapo | Invalid Case parameter |
| Smart Plug | Matter over Wifi | tp-link | Invalid Case parameter |
| Hub | Matter over Wifi | SwitchBot | No shared trusted root |
| Smart Bulb | Matter over Wifi | OREIN | No shared trusted root |
| Smart Sensor for Doors & Windows | Matter over Thread | Eve | Invalid Case parameter |
| Light strip | Matter over Thread | Nanoleaf | Invalid Case parameter |**
