{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An slab-out-of-bound access in `rsvp_change()` due to missing checks on `RSVP_PINFO` passed from the user. This leads to an out-of-bounds read in `rsvp_classify()` when accessing a memory location using an offset controlled by the user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Missing input validation",
      "Wild pointer access"
    ],
    "impact": "Local denial-of-service (system crash) and potential information leak.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "A local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability in any user or network namespace is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "details": "The `rsvp_change` function does not properly validate the `RSVP_PINFO` data passed to the kernel, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `rsvp_classify` function. The offset used for memory access is fully controlled by the user, making it a wild pointer access, which can cause a kernel crash. The RSVP classifier has been removed upstream to mitigate the issue."
