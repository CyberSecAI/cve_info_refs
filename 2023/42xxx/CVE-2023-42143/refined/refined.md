- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing integrity check during firmware update process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Shelly TRV device does not verify the integrity of the firmware file during the update process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a backdoor by redirecting the device to an attacker-controlled server hosting a manipulated firmware file. The device will then update using the malicious firmware.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves redirecting the device to an attacker-controlled machine hosting the malicious firmware during the update process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to redirect the device to their controlled server during the firmware update. This may involve network manipulation.
