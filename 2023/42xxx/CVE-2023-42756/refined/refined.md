{
  "CVE-2023-42756": {
    "Root cause": "A race condition exists in the netfilter subsystem's ipset functionality. Specifically, a race can occur between the `IPSET_CMD_ADD` and `IPSET_CMD_SWAP` commands. During the `call_ad` function's retry loop, no lock is held when `cond_resched()` is called. This allows another thread to swap the ipset while the first thread is rescheduling.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
       "Incorrect reference counter usage",
       "Lack of proper locking during rescheduling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can trigger a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by sending crafted netlink messages to trigger the race condition between the `IPSET_CMD_ADD` and `IPSET_CMD_SWAP` commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace. Local user access is required."
