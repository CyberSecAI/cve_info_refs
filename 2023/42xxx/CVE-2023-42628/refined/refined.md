Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-42628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper output encoding when rendering content from child wiki pages within the parent page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the parent page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS because the malicious payload is saved in the database as the content of a child wiki page and executed when the parent page is viewed.
*   **Missing Output Encoding:** The application fails to encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the context of a webpage. Specifically, the content field of wiki child pages is not properly sanitized or encoded when displayed on a parent wiki page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the browser of any user who views the affected parent wiki page.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter or deface the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wiki Child Page Creation:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `content` field when creating a child wiki page.
*   **Parent Page Access:** The payload executes when a victim user visits the parent wiki page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify wiki pages.
*   **Privilege Requirement:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges/permissions to create child pages. While the advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be triggered by an administrator, it is not restricted to only administrators, but to those who possess the necessary permissions.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to rely on a victim visiting the parent wiki page that contains a reference to the attacker's crafted child page.

**Affected Versions:**

* Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 83 and above
* Liferay DXP 7.1
* Liferay DXP 7.2
* Liferay DXP 7.3
* Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 88
* Liferay Portal 7.1.0 through 7.4.3.87

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Liferay DXP 7.3 update 34
*   Liferay DXP 7.4 update 88
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.88

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Michael Oelke.
*   Liferay assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.0, which Pentagrid notes might be an overestimation due to the need for administrative privileges, rating it as informational or low-impact. However, the CVSS score reflects the potential impact of successful exploitation.
*   Pentagrid describes the vulnerability as a persistent XSS vulnerability, emphasizing the stored nature of the malicious code within the application.
*   The specific payload is placed within the child pageâ€™s content, and it's rendered as text in the parent page's view of the child page.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the necessary conditions for exploitation.
