# Server-side request forgery

Moderate

[renchap](/renchap)
published
GHSA-hcqf-fw2r-52g4
Sep 19, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 4.2.0-beta1, < 4.2.0-rc2

## Patched versions

4.2.0-rc2

## Description

### Summary

By crafting specific input, attackers can inject arbitrary data into HTTP requests issued by Mastodon.

Found and reported by Gabriel Campana

### Details

Pre-releases of Mastodon 4.2.0 up to 4.2.0-rc1 performed insufficient validation and escaping of URL path components,

Incorrect URL normalization, allowing arbitrary headers injection and HTTP request splitting.

### Impact

This can be used to perform confused deputy attacks if the server configuration includes `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` to allow access to local exploitable services.

### Severity

Moderate

5.4

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-42450

### Weaknesses
