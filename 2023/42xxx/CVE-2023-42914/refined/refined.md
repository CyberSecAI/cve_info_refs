```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the Kernel component, specifically due to a memory handling issue.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An application can exploit the memory handling flaw to break out of its sandbox.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows a malicious app to bypass security restrictions and potentially access sensitive system resources or data outside its designated sandbox.
- Attack vectors: A malicious application could be crafted to trigger the memory handling issue within the Kernel, leading to sandbox escape.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the capability to execute a malicious application on the target device to exploit this vulnerability.
