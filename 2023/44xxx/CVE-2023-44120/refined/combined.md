Update to V23Q4 or later version

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Spectrum Power provides basic components for SCADA, communications, and data modeling for con-
trol and monitoring systems. Application suites can be added to optimize network and generation
management for all areas of energy management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44120

The affected product’s sudo configuration permits the local administrative account to execute several
entries as root user. This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and gain
root access.
