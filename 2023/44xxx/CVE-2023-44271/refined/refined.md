  "CVE-2023-44271": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 10.0.0. It is a Denial of Service that uncontrollably allocates memory to process a given task, potentially causing a service to crash by having it run out of memory. This occurs for truetype in ImageFont when textlength in an ImageDraw instance operates on a long text argument.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the `textlength` method of `ImageDraw` when handling long text arguments with TrueType fonts. Specifically, the `getlength`, `getbbox`, and `getmask2` methods of the `ImageFont` module are vulnerable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
       "CWE-400",
       "CWE-770"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing an excessively long text string, leading to excessive memory allocation and potentially crashing the service or application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks by sending crafted image processing requests.",
         "By providing an excessively long text argument to the vulnerable methods"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the text input to an ImageDraw instance using a TrueType font, or by direct calls to the ImageFont methods.",
        "additional_details": "The fix for this vulnerability involves introducing a `MAX_STRING_LENGTH` constant in the `ImageFont` module and checking the length of the input string in `getlength`, `getbbox`, and `getmask2` methods.  The check can be disabled by setting `ImageFont.MAX_STRING_LENGTH = None`."
