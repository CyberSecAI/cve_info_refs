VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-30527

The affected application assigns improper access rights to specific folders containing executable files
and libraries.

This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.

CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44315

The affected application improperly sanitizes certain SNMP configuration data retrieved from monitored
devices. An attacker with access to a monitored device could prepare a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack that may lead to unintentional modification of application data by legitimate users.
