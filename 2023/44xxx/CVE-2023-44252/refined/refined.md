- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a guessable static JSON Web Token (JWT) secret.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of a static and easily guessable secret for generating JWTs. This allows an attacker to forge valid JWTs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to improper access control, enabling an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access or perform actions as another user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious actor can craft and use a forged JWT to gain access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable FortiWAN device is located and have knowledge of the easily guessable static JWT secret. They also require a valid username to create a malicious JWT. A low privileged user can generate the malicious JWT.
