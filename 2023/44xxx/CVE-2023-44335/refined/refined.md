- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires user interaction
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access and must convince a user to open a specially crafted file.
