The provided content is related to CVE-2023-44255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capacity to filter logs by administrator access within FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer & FortiAnalyzer-BigData. This allows a privileged attacker with administrative read permissions to bypass access controls and potentially read event logs of another ADOM (Administrative Domain).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of personal information to an unauthorized actor [CWE-359]
- Insufficient access control on event log data
- Ability to bypass log filtering based on administrator access
- Vulnerability resides within the GUI component of the products

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure of event logs belonging to other administrative domains
- Potential exposure of sensitive information contained within these logs.
- Impact is primarily information disclosure, no tampering or direct system access is implied.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative read permissions in the affected system.
- The attacker needs access to the network to make the crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests.
