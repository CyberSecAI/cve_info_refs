- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read, which means the software attempts to access memory locations outside the allocated buffer or data structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, which means sensitive information could potentially be exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs local access to the system. The user interaction (UI:R) implies that the user would need to open a malicious file or perform some other action for the exploit to be triggered. The attack is also non-privileged (PR:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the user has to perform a specific action, like opening a specially crafted file.
