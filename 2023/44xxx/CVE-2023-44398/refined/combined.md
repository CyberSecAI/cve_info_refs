# Out-of-bounds write in BmffImage::brotliUncompress

High

[kevinbackhouse](/kevinbackhouse)
published
GHSA-hrw9-ggg3-3r4r
Nov 5, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

0.28.0

## Patched versions

0.28.1

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of Exiv2 are *not* affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

### Patches

The bug is fixed in version v0.28.1.

### For more information

Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.

### Credit

This bug was found by [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-44398

### Weaknesses

[CWE-122](/advisories?query=cwe%3A122)
