- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions they are not authorized to, which can lead to various impacts, depending on the specific function affected.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing the vulnerable function without proper authentication or authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges. The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.
