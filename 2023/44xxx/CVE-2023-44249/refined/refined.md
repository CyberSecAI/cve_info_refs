Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the weak, predictable nature of the `taskid` values used by FortiManager for asynchronous tasks. These `taskid` values are numerical and incremental, making them easy to guess or brute-force.
*   There is a lack of proper permission controls when retrieving task results using `taskid`. This allows a user to access results of tasks not related to their specific administrative domain (ADOM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):**  Users can access task results using a `taskid` that they do not own, meaning that they are able to access other users' tasks results.
*   **Weak Randomness:** The `taskid` values are predictable (numerical and incremental), making brute-force attacks feasible.
*  **Missing Access Control:** There is no proper permission check to ensure that a user is authorized to retrieve results for a particular `taskid` based on the ADOM context, which leads to the ability to view other ADOMs' data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can access sensitive information related to other ADOMs (administrative domains), including:
    *   Names of devices belonging to other ADOMs.
    *   Names of other ADOMs (potentially containing customer names).
    *   Usernames.
    *   Other task related information.
*   This information disclosure can lead to a breach of confidentiality and potentially further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the network via HTTP requests.
*   An authenticated user makes a request to create an asynchronous task which is assigned an incremental `taskid`. Then the user can attempt to access results of other tasks by requesting other numerical `taskid` values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of FortiManager, with low privileges (read-only user or a read-write user).
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the FortiManager server.
*   The attacker does not need any special permissions, since they are able to access other tasks from their own account.

**Additional notes:**

*   The `taskid` values can persist for months without expiring.
*   The vulnerability was found in the "Policy & Objects > Tools > Find Unused Policies" functionality but might be present in other parts of the system that handles asynchronous tasks in the same manner.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as a **Moderate** severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.5 according to the GitHub advisory, and 4.1 in the Fortinet advisory.

* FortiManager VM64 v7.2.2-build1334 230201 (GA)
