- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected applications contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when reading past the end of an allocated structure during SPP file parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious SPP file to the user of the vulnerable application. The user must then open the malicious file with the application.
