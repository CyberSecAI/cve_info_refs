            "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ConcreteCMS team argues that the Header and Footer Tracking Code's sole functionality is to allow an admin to add javascript to all pages. Therefore, using them to add javascript to a website is not a vulnerability but a core feature.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "According to the ConcreteCMS team, there is no vulnerability as the fields are designed to accept Javascript. The reporter argues that unsanitized JavaScript can be injected in these fields, but ConcreteCMS does not see this as a vulnerability.",
            "Impact of exploitation": "The reporter states that an attacker can inject Javascript to steal cookies. ConcreteCMS denies this stating that the session cookies are HttpOnly and not accessible via javascript",
