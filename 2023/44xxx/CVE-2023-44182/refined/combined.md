# User Interfaces to the Junos OS

The Junos OS provides several user interfaces,
including a *command-line interface* (*CLI*), the Junos XML management protocol, the NETCONF management
protocol, and the J-Web graphical user interface. They are described
in the following sections. For more information about the user interfaces,
see the [CLI User Guide](../../information-products/pathway-pages/junos-cli/junos-cli.html).

* [CLI](junos-software-user-interfaces-overview.html#jd0e36)
* [Junos XML API, Junos XML Management Protocol, and NETCONF Management
  Protocol](junos-software-user-interfaces-overview.html#jd0e161)
* [J-Web User Interface](junos-software-user-interfaces-overview.html#jd0e191)
## CLI

The Junos CLI is the user interface available when a user logs
in to a router through the console or auxiliary port, or logs in remotely.
The CLI has two modes: operational mode, which provides commands for
monitoring the Junos OS, routing protocols, network interfaces and
connectivity, and router hardware; and configuration mode, which provides
commands for configuring the Junos OS.

The Junos CLI provides the following functionality:

* Context-sensitive name completion for commands, configuration
  statements, and other text strings, such as filenames and usernames.
  When you type only the initial part of a name and press the Tab key
  or the Spacebar, the CLI automatically adds the remainder of the name
  if there is only one possible completion. If multiple completions
  are possible, the CLI lists them and displays a short description
  of each.

  Similarly, if you type a question mark (?) after the
  starting portion of a term (word) in a command or [configuration
  statement](#jd0e53 "configuration statement"), or after a complete term and a following
  space, the CLI displays the terms that can be specified at that position
  in the command or statement, along with a short description of each.
* Keyword search for commands and configuration statements
  (similar to the UNIX apropos command). The help apropos *topic* command displays all commands or configuration
  statements that include the specified *topic* word or phrase in their names or short description. In configuration
  mode, this feature is context-sensitiveâthe CLI displays only
  the matching terms that are valid at or below the current level in
  the configuration hierarchy.
* Automatic display of one screen at a time when command
  output or the list of possible completions is longer than the screen
  length (similar to the effect of the UNIX more utility).
  You can scroll backward and forward through the screen output and
  search for text strings in it.
* Keyboard sequences for editing the command line and moving
  the cursor on it, and for scrolling through a list of recently executed
  commands. The keyboard sequences are the same as those used in the
  UNIX editor Emacs. For example, when you type Ctrl+b, the cursor moves
  backward one character.
* Tracking of commands issued during the current CLI session.
  To display them, issue the show cli history command.

You can customize your CLI environment in the following ways:

* Define the terminal type as ANSI, VT100, or regular
  or small xterm.
* Disable command completion.
* Display helpful hints about how to use the CLI.
* Enable an automatic prompt for the user to restart the
  router after a software upgrade. Restarting is required for the new
  software to take effect.
* Set the CLI prompt.
* Set the duration that a login session
  can be idle before it is terminated.
* Set the screen length, width, or both.

You can apply filters to command output to change the CLIâs
standard display behavior in the following ways:

* Count the number of lines in the output instead
  of displaying the actual output.
* Display only text that matches or does not match
  a pattern. The Junos OS supports the use of extended (modern) regular
  expressions as defined in POSIXÂ 1003.2.
* Display all output at once (override the default behavior
  of displaying one screen of output at a time).
* Display only the final lines of output.
* Suppress redisplay of the CLI prompt
  at the end of command output.
* Save (redirect) the screen output to a file.

When displaying the current configuration, you can filter the
output in the following ways in addition to those in the preceding
list:

* Compare the current configuration with a previously saved
  configuration.
* Display additional information about the configuration,
  including the version of the Junos OS under which the configuration
  was created.

You can also apply multiple filters in sequence, and write scripts
that customize the output in ways not provided by the CLI. For information
about scripting, see the [Automation Scripting Feature Guide](../../information-products/pathway-pages/config-guide-automation/config-guide-automation.html).

For detailed information about the CLI features described in
this section, see the [CLI User Guide](../../information-products/pathway-pages/junos-cli/junos-cli.html).

## Junos XML API, Junos XML Management Protocol, and NETCONF Management Protocol

The *Junos Extensible Markup Language (XML) application
programming interface (API)* defines XML tag elements that
correspond to all Junos configuration statements and many operational
commands. XML is a language for defining a set of markers (tag elements)
that are applied to a data set or document to describe the function
of individual elements and codify the hierarchical relationships between
them.

The *Junos XML management protocol* enables
client applications to exchange information with Juniper Networks
devices. The Junos XML management protocol defines XML tag elements
that retrieve and change Junos configuration objects, which are represented
by the XML tag elements in the Junos XML API.

The *NETCONF management protocol* is similar
in function to the Junos XML management protocol and is defined in
RFCÂ 4741, *NETCONF Configuration Protocol*. The NETCONF server and client applications use the SSH protocol
for communication in accordance with RFCÂ 4742, *Using
the NETCONF Configuration Protocol over Secure SHell (SSH)*.

## J-Web User Interface

The *J-Web* user interface is a graphical
user interface that enables you to configure and monitor Juniper Networks
devices through an Internet browser. The J-Web interface includes
the following features:

* Quick Configuration pages for performing basic configuration
  operations
* Monitoring tools that display system status, routes, and
  statistics
* Diagnostic tools
* A View Events page that displays system log messages
* File utilities for managing configuration files, licenses,
  and temporary files

# Guidelines for gRPC and gNMI Sensors (Junos Telemetry Interface)

Note:

The logical and physical Packet Forwarding Engine interface sensors report some leaves
inconsistently to the collector. For example, the subscribed path
/interfaces/interface/ producing the streamed path
/junos/system/linecard/interface/logical/usage/ reports key name
leaves `parent_ae_name` and `init_time` (with underscores in
the leaf name). The subscribed path /interfaces/interface/state/
producing the streamed path /junos/system/linecard/interface/queue/
reports key name leaves `parent-ae-name` and `init-time` (with
hyphens in the leaf name).

Starting with Junos OS Release 18.3R1, ON\_CHANGE streaming of LLDP telemetry sensor
information is supported through gRPC for MX Series and PTX Series routers.

Starting with Junos OS Release 18.3R1, QFX5120-48Y and EX4650 switches are also
supported.

routers are also supported.

Starting with Junos OS Release 18.4R1, BGP operational states are aligned and compliant with
OpenConfig data model openconfig-bgp-operational.yang. To stream BGP
operational states, use the resource path
/network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/.
Previously, the path was /bgp/.

Starting in Junos OS Evolved Release 19.1R1, OpenConfig (OC) and Junos Telemetry Interface
(JTI) are supported. Both gRPC APIs and the customer-facing CLI remain the same as for the
Junos OS. As was standard for Junos OS, Network Agent (NA) and OC packages are part of the
Junos OS Evolved image.

Starting with Junos OS Release 22.4R1, sensors are supported on MX304 routers.

The <https://apps.juniper.net/ydm-explorer/> tool
is the best location to search for and view information about telemetry sensors.

For information that is not yet supported by Junos YANG Data Model Explorer (mainly Packet
Forwarding Engine sensors) please refer to [Table 1](#id-guidelines-for-grpc-and-gnmi-sensors-junos-telemetry-interface__system-resource-strings) and [Table 2](#id-guidelines-for-grpc-and-gnmi-sensors-junos-telemetry-interface__bbe-sensors).

To activate a sensor, use the corresponding resource path. Each resource path enables data
streaming for the system resource globally, that is, systemwide. You can also modify each
resource path, such as to specify a specific logical or physical interface. For example, to
specify a specific interface, include the following at the end of the path:
`[name='interface-name']/`

## Supported gRPC and gNMI Sensors

See [Table 1](#id-guidelines-for-grpc-and-gnmi-sensors-junos-telemetry-interface__system-resource-strings) for a description of supported gRPC and gNMI sensors and [Table 2](#id-guidelines-for-grpc-and-gnmi-sensors-junos-telemetry-interface__bbe-sensors)
for a description of supported broadband edge (BBE) gRPC sensors, including the subscription
path you use to provision the sensors.

Starting with Junos OS Release 20.1R1, the on-device gRPC framework is upgraded to version
v1.18.0 and is applicable to both JET and JTI. This version includes important enhancements
for gRPC. Earlier legacy Junos OS platform versions (non-Occam) will continue to use version
v1.3.0.

Starting with Junos OS Release 20.2R1, JTI supports MX routers with dual Routing Engines or
MX Series Virtual Chassis on all Packet Forwarding Engine and Routing Engine sensors
currently supported on MX Series routers. The level of sensor support currently available
for MX Series routers applies, whether through streaming or ON\_CHANGE statistics export,
using UDP, remote procedure call (gRPC) services or gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI)
services. Additionally, JTI operational mode commands will provide details for all Routing
Engines and MX Series Virtual Chassis, too.

Table 1: gRPC Sensors
| resource path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/interfaces/interface/state/forwarding-viable` | Packet Forwarding Engine sensor for non-viable aggregated interface member links. This feature does not support non-LAG link members Starting in Junos OS Evolved Release 21.4R1, streaming statistics by means of gRPC and gNMI is supported on PTX10008 and PTX10016 routers. |
| `/junos/ike-security-associations/ike-security-association/routing-instance [name=â routing-instance-name]` | Sensor for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) security statistics.  When you configure a subscription request, use the `reporting-interval` parameter to configure the interval (in seconds) in which statistics are reported.  Starting with Junos OS Release 18.1R1, MX Series routers are supported.   * `remote-ip` * `local-ip` * `number-ipsec-sa-created` * `number-ipsec-sa-deleted` * `number-ipsec-sa-rekey` * `exchange-type` * `in-bytes` * `in-packets` * `out-bytes` * `out-packets` * `delete-payload-received` * `delete-payload-transmitted` * `dpd-request-payload-received` * `dpd-request-payload-transmitted` * `dpd-response-payload-received` * `dpd-response-payload-transmitted` * `dpd-response-payload-missed` * `dpd-response-payload-maximum-delay` * `dpd-response-seq-payload-missed` * `invalid-spi-notify-received` * `invalid-spi-notify-transmitted` * `routing-instance` |
| `/junos/kernel/tcpip/rtstock` | Sensor for kernel routing table socket (RTSOCK) information.  Starting with Junos OS Release 19.3R1, EX9200, EX9251, EX9253, MX240, MX480, MX960, MX2010, MX2020, vMX, PTX1000, PTX10008, PTX10016, PTX3000 with RE-PTX-X8-64G, and PTX5000 with RE-PTX-X8-64G are supported.  You can also add the following as the end path for /junos/kernel/rtsock/:   * `total-error-cnt` * `total-veto-cnt` |
| `/junos/memory/` | Sensor for CPU memory. This sensor exports the CPU and memory utilization per process and CPU usage for threads per process. The current implementation is Linux-based; therefore, the export information and gathered output format differs significantly from this sensorâs performance on previous platforms.

| `/junos/system/linecard/ddos/` | Distributed denial of service (DDoS) sensor. This sensor supports the Openconfig data model junos/ui/openconfig/yang/ and junos-ddos.yang.  You can stream information using Juniper proprietary gRPC or UDP (native) export.  There are 45 packet types for DDoS. To maintain a reasonably sized data stream, data is exported for all protocols that have seen traffic using the zero-suppression model.  On QFX5000 platforms, multiple protocols can share the same CPU queue. DDoS configurations are applied at the CPU queue level. Consequently, DDoS statistics fetched from the CPU queue will return the aggregate value of all protocols using that queue. For example, if BGP, LDP, and RSVP protocols are using a particular CPU queue, but the DDoS limit is violated only by the BGP protocol, the DDoS violation reported will include all three protocols: BGP, LDP, and RSVP. This information will be exported to the collector with the DDoS sensor.  Starting in Junos OS Release 22.1R1 EX4650, QFX5110, QFX5120-48Y, QFX5200 and QFX5210 switches are supported.

| `/junos/system/linecard/packet-capture` | Sensor for secure packet capture.  Starting in Junos OS Release 21.2R1 on EX4400 switches, we support secure packet capture. You can use this feature to capture packets from a device and send them over a secure channel to an external collector (in the cloud) for monitoring and analysis. The maximum size of the packet you can capture is 128 bytes, including the packet header and the data within. Network professionals use real-time packet capture data to troubleshoot complex issues such as network and performance degradation and poor end-user experience.  To use secure packet capture, include the */junos/system/linecard/packet-capture* resource path using a Junos RPC call.  For ingress packet capture, include the packet-capture option in the existing firewall filter configuration at the  ``` [edit firewall family family-name filter filter-name term match-term then         packet-capture] ```  hierarchy level. Do this before you send packet capture sensor data to the collector and remove the packet-capture configuration after data is sent to the collector. After the capture is done, ingress packets with the filter match conditions are trapped to the CPU. The trapped packets then go to the collector over a secure channel in JTI-specified format in key-value pairs by means of Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) transport.  For egress packet capture on physical interfaces (ge-\*, xe-\*, mge-\*, and et-\*), include "packet-capture-telemetry," "egress," and "interface <interface-name>" at the `[edit forwarding-options]` hierarchy level. For example:  `set forwarding-options packet-capture-telemetry egress interface ge-0/0/0`  `set forwarding-options packet-capture-telemetry egress interface ge-0/0/10`  You can add multiple interfaces on the device for egress packet capture. When configured, host-bound egress packets are captured from the interface and sent to the collector. As with the ingress configuration, remove the configuration when packet capture is not required. |
| `/interfaces/` | Sensor for device monitoring.  To stream statistics, use the resource path  /interfaces/ in a subscription to export statistics to a collector in the following format: `/interfaces/interface[name='et-*/*/*']/`.

The following end points are supported:   * `/queues/queue[name=â0â]/state/transmit-pkts` * `/queues/queue[name=â0â]/state/transmit-octets` * `/queues/queue[name=â0â]/state/dropped-pkts`   Starting in Junos OS Evolved Release 21.4R1, streaming statistics by means of gRPC and gNMI is supported on PTX10001-36MR, PTX10003, PTX10004, PTX10008, and PTX10016 routers. |
| `/system/alarms/alarm` | INITIAL\_SYNC support for OpenConfig data model openconfig-platform.yang and openconfig-alarms.yang. This feature lets the collector have a complete view of the current state of every sensor it is subscribed to. INITIAL\_SYNC requires that at least one copy of all the sensors be sent to the collector.  Starting in Junos OS Evolved Release 21.4R1, streaming statistics by means of gRPC and gNMI is supported on PTX10001-36MR, PTX10003, PTX10004, PTX10008, and PTX10016 routers. |
