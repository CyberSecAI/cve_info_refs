# CVE-2023-44077: ShareBrowser Privilege Escalation

Jan 18, 2024

A bit of a tangent from my usual work, but here with a fun one: [CVE-2023-44077](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44077)! A privilege escalation vulnerability in [Studio Network Solution](https://www.studionetworksolutions.com)’s [ShareBrowser application](https://www.studionetworksolutions.com/sharebrowser/), thanks to unguarded XPC services 🎉.

* Resolved version: [v7.0 and newer](https://support.studionetworksolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/22494658980244-ShareBrowser-v-7-0-Released)

## Examining ShareBrowser’s bundled launch services

To start off, we’ll install ShareBrowser’s macOS client (v6.1.5.27) and check what launch services our Virtual Machine registers:

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/ShareBrowser-Daemons.png)

If we examine one of these daemons, for example `com.sns.evo-slingshot-helper.plist`, we see that it exposes a Mach Service for processes to attach onto:

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/slingshot-helper-daemon.png)

When we look at the rest of the services, we see 3 out of 5 of them expose a Mach Service:

| Service | Variant | Exposed XPC service | Running as root |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| com.sns.sbdccommunicationhelper.plist | Agent | sbdccommunicationhelper | No |
| com.sns.evo-slingshot-helper.plist | Daemon | EvoSlingshotHelper | YES |
| com.sns.sbdcmounthelper.plist | Daemon | sbdcmounthelper | YES |
| com.sns.sbdiskservice.plist | Daemon |  | YES |
| com.sns.sbhmdimporter.plist | Daemon |  | YES |

## Digging deeper into XPC services

Now that we found some launch services with exposed Mach services, let’s take a peek inside how one works.

We’ll load up `/Library/EVO ShareBrowser/EvoSlingshotHelper` into Hopper Disassembler, and take a peek at `-[BaseSlingshotService listener:shouldAcceptNewConnection:]`:

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/evo_should_accept_connection.png)

Those who have worked with XPCs before might be having PTSD right now. For those who don’t, let me explain.

In an XPC service’s `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, there should be some form of validation performed before blindly accepting a connection. Why this is important is that anything that connects will gain the abilities of that service. This includes the elevated privileges and XPC functions that might include sensitive information.

For ShareBrowser’s `EvoSlingshotHelper` specifically, this daemon has process calls, API calls, user credentials processing, etc inside. And since this application is written in Objective-C, it’s inherently at risk of memory safety bugs and potentially vulnerable to additional attacks such as buffer overflows for arbitrary code execution as root.

Now add this with `sbdccommunicationhelper` and `sbdcmounthelper`, we have a fun trio of potentially vulnerable services.

## Possible solutions

Thanks to some amazing posts by [Wojciech Reguła](https://wojciechregula.blog), [Csaba Fitzl](https://theevilbit.github.io), [Erik Berglund](https://erikberglund.github.io) and [Christian from Objective Development](https://obdev.at/index.html), we have some great resources to understand both the severity and solutions to ShareBrowser’s issues:

* [Learn XPC exploitation - Broken cryptography](https://wojciechregula.blog/post/learn-xpc-exploitation-part-1-broken-cryptography/)
* [Abusing & Securing XPC in macOS apps](https://objectivebythesea.org/v3/talks/OBTS_v3_wRegu%C5%82a.pdf)
* [CVE-2020-0984 - Secure coding XPC Services](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/secure_coding_xpc_part3/)
* [The Story Behind CVE-2019-13013](https://obdev.at/blog/what-we-have-learned-from-a-vulnerability/)
* [No Privileged Helper Tool Left Behind](https://erikberglund.github.io/2016/No_Privileged_Helper_Tool_Left_Behind/)

The simplest answer without going too deep is to ensure there’s proper code signature verification on processes wanting to attach. This means comparing the calling binary to a trusted certificate like a notarized binary with the developer’s Team ID.

* For macOS Ventura and newer: [`setCodeSigningRequirement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/3943309-setcodesigningrequirement?language=objc)
* For macOS Monterey and older: [`SecCodeCheckValidity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1396726-seccodecheckvalidity?language=objc)

If we take a peek at a good platform citizen, such as [WhiteBox’ Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html), we see that they’ve implemented proper code signature checks that verify the authenticity of the application calling, and as such isn’t as easily abused:

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/packages_should_accept_connection.png)

## Reporting process

Overall a bit annoying process as with most companies lacking a security team, mainly caused by poor communication. While not expecting a bug bounty, there was no compensation, notification of a public release or even crediting us for the vulnerability…

Though overall the main issue we faced was that after reporting the issue, we didn’t get a proper team to respond until after we threatened to publicize the vulnerability and have a CVE ID associated.

Remember kids, threatening to run to the press doesn’t just work on Apple ;p

* This is a great reminder that you need to hold companies accountable, and using [Project Zero’s 90+30 disclosure policy](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html) is a great way to do so. (Thanks [Devin Byrd (Wanderingbug)](https://blog.kandji.io/author/devin-byrd) for the tip!)
* Table reference: RIPEDA Consulting is where I work, and where I’ve been able to research and report this vulnerability.

## Verifying the updated bundles

Studio Network Solutions’ interim solution to this vulnerability was to strip all XPC services and have us deploy it to all machines we manage. Finally, after several months, we were able to grab an official copy to verify the fix.

Examining [ShareBrowser v7.0.0.12](https://www.snsftp.com/guest/sharebrowser/7.0.0/ShareBrowser_v7.0.0.12.dmg) ([archive.org mirror](https://archive.org/details/share-browser-v-7.0.0.12)), we see they’ve stripped all but 1 launch service: `com.sns.sbdcmounthelper.plist`

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/ShareBrowser-7-pkg.png)

This service, as with before, points to `/Library/EVO ShareBrowser/sbdcmounthelper`. When we examine this daemon again, we see signature verification! Specifically ShareBrowser is verifying against their Team ID, `76PTYDYVW4` 🎉

![](/images/posts/2024-01-18-CVE-2023-44077/sbdcmounthelper-signatures.png)

## Conclusion

Overall I’m fairly happy this vulnerability was patched however I would advise Studio Network Solution customers to be cautious when handling sensitive information through SNS products. As there doesn’t seem to be a security team, you should keep in mind that future vulnerabilities may not be handled with the most care.

Otherwise this was a really great learning opportunity for me. Since this initial discovery, RIPEDA has implemented [Project Zero’s 90+30 disclosure policy](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html) to avoid issues with delayed vendor rollouts in the future. And big thanks to [Devin Byrd (Wanderingbug)](https://blog.kandji.io/author/devin-byrd), [Csaba Fitzl (theevilbit)](https://theevilbit.github.io), and others on the [macOSsec slack](https://macossec.slack.com/) for their help answering my questions!

And for everyone else developing XPC services, ***make sure you properly validate who’s connecting!***

# ShareBrowser Media Asset Manager (MAM)

![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sharebrowser-gui-gallery-view-angled-image.jpg)
##### Search, find, tag, comment, and preview… for the whole team

ShareBrowser enables your users to organize and search for media and projects across EVO storage as well as local, offline, and other SAN/NAS network disks.

Assets can be catalogued, tagged, and commented, so everyone on the team can easily find, preview, and share media and projects.

ShareBrowser is perfect for post-production teams that collaborate around a shared storage workflow, giving everyone a central, searchable database.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sharebrowser-gui-comments-preview-tags-smaller-image.jpg)

* [Overview](/sharebrowser/)
* [FAQ](/sharebrowser/faq/)

## Search, find, and preview your media

##### Find what you need

Everyone can easily search and find assets using tags, comments, and metadata such as name, codec, frame rate, modified date, resolution, and other file attributes.

##### Preview your media

Not sure if you’ve found the right clip? Preview media directly from ShareBrowser’s integrated player. Just press the spacebar to start playback of the proxy file, which is playable even if the original source media is offline.

##### Download proxies

Need to make a quick edit to your timeline but you don’t have time to download the original file? No problem, use ShareBrowser Web App to download proxies on your machine.

##### Organize your files with bins

Your editors and assistant editors can easily organize and share media using ShareBrowser bins, without creating duplicates and filling up space on your storage.

##### NLE integrations

Now available as a panel directly within Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects and an extension in Final Cut Pro. ShareBrowser also features native project and bin sharing in Avid Media Composer, and EVO hosts the DaVinci Resolve database so you have a smooth workflow in any NLE.

##### No additional cost or hardware

ShareBrowser’s server software runs inside your EVO. All indexing (cataloguing) and proxy generation can be handled automatically inside EVO, meaning you don’t need additional server hardware to use ShareBrowser. **Unlimited client licenses** are included with EVO.

## Easy-to-use asset management

##### Simple asset management—add tags/keywords and make comments on your assets from folder level down to file level.

Anyone on your team can quickly add tags and comments to media and projects from within ShareBrowser.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

## Create your own custom fields

Custom metadata fields give you the power to structure and capture the most valuable information for your team.

You can use tags and comments, and you can also create fields for talent, clients, job types, directors, project numbers, and anything else that’s important to your organization.

## Integrations with Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve

Search your media—with all the custom tags and comments—directly from your favorite NLE using the Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects panel, and Final Cut Pro extension.

By hosting the DaVinci Resolve PostgreSQL database on EVO, your editing team can access their work without duplicating and exporting projects for each user.

## Project locking & collaboration

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sharebrowser-automatic-project-locking-and-Avid-bin-locking.jpg)

##### Collaborate effectively—automatic project locking and Avid bin locking

Features such as Avid bin locking and ShareBrowser’s ability to lock Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro projects mean your video editors won’t save over the top of each other.

##### **Shared storage works best when it helps your NLE**

ShareBrowser enables native Media Composer bin locking, and also includes a customizable Automatic Project Locking system for other media applications and file types, such as Photoshop and Illustrator.

When you lock a project you get full access; others have read access until you release the lock. If you need write access to a locked file, just send a request through ShareBrowser and the owner will be instantly notified.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/evo-shareb-storage-evo-family-with-all-of-the-nles-23.jpg)

Project Locking is available for After Effects, Photoshop, Pro Tools, and many others.

AI/ML functionality is an optional feature, additional charges apply.

## Use artificial intelligence to automatically tag video.

With just the click of a button ShareBrowser can automatically tag your videos. Choose your video, click an icon, and within a matter of minutes the objects and activities in the scenes are automatically identified using AI, tagged with keywords, and searchable.

Learn moreImagine sending thousands of hours of content through AI and having it quickly, accurately, and inexpensively, automatically processed and categorized so that it’s easily searchable by anyone with access to your ShareBrowser database.

## Point your web browser to EVO and login

With ShareBrowser Web App, you can directly browse your storage, preview, add metadata, organize your media, and download proxies. Simply point your web browser to EVO and login!

You’ll instantly find proxies of your EVO’s media, and you’ll love the beautifully designed, intuitive, clutter-free web interface.
