- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to active debug code present in the BIOS of affected Dell PowerEdge and Precision platforms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Active debug code in the BIOS
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated physical attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information tampering, code execution, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the affected system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the system. The attacker does not need any privileges on the target machine and no user interaction is required. The attack complexity is high.
