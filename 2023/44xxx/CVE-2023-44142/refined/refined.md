- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. Specific impacts would vary.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is within a WordPress plugin, and likely exploitable by a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber, which is a low-privileged role in WordPress.
