consolidated solution.

Integrated solution

The PowerProtect DP Series Appliance is a converged solution that offers complete backup, replication, recovery, deduplication,
instant access, restore, reporting and analytics, cloud readiness with disaster recovery and long-term retention to the cloud-all
in a single appliance. The appliance is available in various configurations based on your requirements and storage capacity.
● DP4400

The DP4400 model is a hyperconverged, 2U system that a user can install and configure onsite.

The DP4400 includes a virtual edition of Protection Software server (Protection Software (Service)) as the Protection
Software node, a virtual edition of Protection Storage system (Protection Storage) as the Protection Storage node, Cloud
DR, Data Protection Central as a centralized system management , an Appliance Configuration Manager(ACM) for simplified
configuration and upgrades, Cyber Recovery, Reporting & Analytics, and a compute node that hosts the virtual components and
the software.

DP4400 contains an Hypervisor server, which hosts all these virtual editions of the point products that are mentioned above.

NOTE: The Cloud DR node is available in the appliance based on the license that you have.

The Reporting & Analytics and Cloud DR components are optional. Also, you can perform the Search, Reporting & Analytics, and
Cloud DR functions in a central corporate implementation with Data Protection Central.

Cyber Recovery (CR) solution is supported for new installations of DP4400. For information regarding the prerequisites, IP
address requirements, configuration, and replication, see Cyber Recovery implementation for PowerProtect DP4400.

If your organization enables communication through the Internet, as part of the initial configuration of the system, you can
register the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance Appliance, Protection Software, Protection Storage and components with
Secure Connect Gateway (formerly ESRS). The Secure Connect Gateway is a secure, IP-based, distributed customer service
support system that provides Dell EMC customers with command, control, and visibility of support-related activities.

Centralized management

The Data Protection Central provides advanced monitoring and management capabilities of the PowerProtect DP Series
Appliance from a single pane of glass and includes the following features.

● A comprehensive dashboard that allows you to manage and includes information about Protection Software, Protection

Storage, Search, and Data Protection Advisor components.
○ Backup activities
○ Replication activities
○ Assets
○ Capacity
○ Health
○ Alerts

● Comprehensive reporting capabilities
● Cloud backups.

Appliance administration

The ACM provides a web-based interface for configuring, monitoring, and upgrading the appliance.

The ACM dashboard displays a summary of the configuration of the individual components. It also enables the administrators
to monitor the appliance, modify configuration details such as expanding the Protection Storage disk capacity, change the
common password for the appliance, update customer information, and change the values in the General Settings panel. The
General Settings panel on the ACM Dashboard allows you to change the LDAP settings, displays the time zones, NTP server
status, external LDAP server status, status of FIPS, and so on. The ACM dashboard enables you to upgrade the system and its
components. It also displays the health information of the Appliance Server and VMware components.

Introduction

7

Backup administration

The PowerProtect DP Series Appliance uses Protection Software (Service) servers for the DP4xxx models perform backup
operations, with the data being stored in a Protection Storage system.

You can also add an Protection Software NDMP Accelerator (you must manually configure the NDMP Accelerator) to enable
backup and recovery of NAS systems. For more information about the configuration details, see Configuration options for the
DP4400 model. The Protection Software NDMP Accelerator uses the network data management protocol (NDMP) to enable
backup and recovery of network-attached storage (NAS) systems. The accelerator performs NDMP processing and then sends
the data directly to the Protection Storage Server (Protection Storage Storage).

NOTE: The PowerProtect DP Series Appliance does not support virtual NDMP (vNDMP).

Reporting and Analytics

The feature offers a robust reporting functionality with dedicated sections for various features. These reports help you retrieve
information about the Protection Storage and Protection Software. Using these reports, you can identify outages in the
environment, diagnose problems, plan to mitigate risks, and forecast future trends. You can also run system and customized
reports, dashboard templates, and schedule the report generation as per your requirements.

Search

The Search feature provides a powerful way to search backup data within the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance and then
restore the backup data based on the results of the Search. Scheduled collection activities are used to gather and index the
metadata (such as keyword, name, type, location, size, and backup server/client, or indexed content) of the backup, which is
then stored within the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance.

NOTE: PowerProtect DP Series Appliance 2.7.6 does not support Search. If your existing appliance has Search and you
upgrade to 2.7.6, you can continue using Search 19.6.3.

Disaster recovery

The Cloud DR is a solution that enables disaster recovery of one or more on-premise services to the cloud. Cloud DR integrates
with the existing on-premise backup software and a Protection Storage system to copy the VM backups to the cloud. It can
then run a disaster recovery test or a failover, which converts a VM to an Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
instance, and then runs this instance in the cloud.

NOTE: Installing Cloud DR components and Reporting and Analytics is optional. Also, if these components are already
configured in your environment, then the appliance can be configured to use the central implementation in your
environment. You do not need to configure the optional components that are bundled in PowerProtect DP Series Appliance
again.

NOTE: While configuring the network, if you select IPv6 network protocol, then Cloud DR and Search are disabled.

However, the dashboard does not display any data that is associated with external Cloud DR, Search, and Data Protection
Advisor. Moreover, you must manage and configure any such external instances. Also, PowerProtect DP Series Appliance
does not support local Search and Analytics (not part of PowerProtect DP Series Appliance but are centrally implemented
at the customer environment) when these functions are performed by external implementations.

Cyber Recovery

The Cyber Recovery solution maintains mission-critical business data and technology configurations in a secure, air-gapped
vault environment that can be used for recovery or analysis. The Cyber Recovery vault (CR Vault) is physically isolated from
the production system or the network. The Cyber Recovery solution enables access to the CR Vault only long enough to
replicate data from the production system. At all other times, the CR Vault is secured and off the network. A deduplication
process is performed in the production environment to expedite the replication process so that connection time to the Cyber
Recovery vault is as short as possible. Within the Cyber Recovery vault, the Cyber Recovery software creates point-in-time
(PIT) retention-locked copies that can be validated and then used for recovery of the production system. Deploying Cyber

● A label must not start or end with a hyphen ( - ).

When you configure the DNS server settings during appliance configuration, ensure that you configure the settings properly.
After you configure the hostname and domain name of the point products, you cannot modify the hostnames for the point
products. However, you can modify the DNS server IP address on the point products after the appliance is configured.

Ensure that the new DNS server has the same hostname and domain names that are associated with the corresponding point
product IP addresses. For more information about modifying the DNS server IP address, see KB Article 537628.

Ensure to have a valid NTP IP address which is reachable from the appliance.

NOTE: Ensure that the time difference between the NTP and Hypervisor server is not more than 10 minutes. If the time
difference between the two servers is more than 10 minutes, then the appliance network configuration may fail.

In case there is no valid IP address for DNS, NTP, and Gateway, the appliance can be configured using the ACM IP address. See
Self Contained Deployment (optional) for more information.

When a range of IP addresses is used during the PowerProtect configuration, the IP addresses are assigned in a standard order.
Once assigned, each IP should be registered in DNS with forward and reverse lookup entries.

A total of 13 IP addresses are needed for all components and one for each Hypervisor and ACM. The total number of IP address
requirements varies according to optional component (shown in the below table) selection. iDRAC also needs an IP address.

Required Serial IDs for PowerProtect DP Series Appliance, Protection
Storage, Protection Software and Reporting and Analytics

The Serial ID that is required on the Secure Connect Gateway configuration window for the Appliance Protection Storage,
Protection Software and Reporting and Analytics components, is referred as follows:

● Activation Serial Number - In the Dell EMC software license activation notification email, under the Software IDs section, or

the Locking ID that is listed at the beginning of the email.

● SWID or LOCKING_ID - In the component product license files.
1. Get the Activation Serial Numbers for the Appliance, Protection Storage, Protection StorageProtection Software, and

Reporting and Analytics components from the Software IDs section of the Dell EMC software license activation notification
email.

The following table lists the input for the Serial ID field in the Secure Connect Gateway configuration window:

Table 13. Secure Connect GatewaySerial ID Fields

Reporting and Analytics

Software ID (auto-populated)

If you encounter any issues such as Dell EMC software license activation notification email is not
readily available with the customer:

● Secure Connect Gateway registration can be performed later after the appliance is configured from the ACM Dashboard.
● The Software IDs (SWID) and Locking IDs for the Appliance, Protection Storage, Protection Software, and Reporting and

Analytics components can be found in the corresponding component license files.

● The serial number for the Appliance (DP4400) can be found in the selskuconfig.xml file. More information about

this file is provided later in this document.

● The Point of Contact for this issue is the Licensing Escalation Team.

Additionally, for Protection Storage, where the DP4400 models have an instance of Protection Storage instead of a
physical Protection Storage, the Instance software-id is used for Secure Connect Gateway registration. An example is
provided below:

# system show serialno detailed
Serial number: IDP00180200004
System software-id: ELMDDV0218XCG5
Instance software-id: ELMDDV04199S11
...

In the DP4400 model, for Protection Storage, the auto-populated Serial Number that is displayed in the Serial ID field is
the same as the Locking_ID of the Appliance when configuring Secure Connect Gateway for Protection Storage.

However, the Instance ID obtained from the above command is what will be used for Secure Connect Gateway
registration and can be verified from the Device Extract DB after the Secure Connect Gateway registration is successful.

procedure.

Run the PowerProtect DP Rapid Upgrade ChecKer utility

The PowerProtect DP Rapid Upgrade ChecKer utility runs all the upgrade pre-checks on the appliance components. These
pre-checks help you identify any errors which could result in an upgrade failure. Ensure that you perform the pre-checks before
the appliance upgrade.

Prerequisites

Ensure that you download the latest PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-<version>.jar and the
corresponding checksum PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-<version>.jar.sha256 files from Dell
Support, to the /data01 on the ACM VM.

About this task

Perform the following steps to run the PowerProtect DP Rapid Upgrade ChecKer utility.

Steps

1. Connect to the ACM with root credentials using SSH.
2. Change the directory to the /data01 folder.
3. Run the sha256sum -c PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-<version>.jar.sha256 command to

verify the checksum of the downloaded file.
The output must be PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-<version>.jar: OK

4. Run the java -jar PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-<version>.jar command to run the

PowerProtect DP Rapid Upgrade ChecKer utility.

Add the component name to perform the checks for a specific component. For example, you must run the following
command to run the upgrade pre-check for just ACM: java -jar PowerProtect-DP-Rapid-Upgrade-ChecKer-
<version>.jar ACM

Manual upgrade of PowerProtect DP Series Appliance Server
Firmware

For Gen 14 models, if the iDRAC firmware version is below 3.30.30.30, then you will not be able to proceed with the appliance
upgrade. You must update the iDRAC firmware version to 3.36.103.36 using dptools to initiate the update before you proceed
with the appliance upgrade

If the firmware of the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance was upgraded to firmware block bundled with PowerProtect DP Series
Appliance, then you need not upgrade the firmware on the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance.

Ensure the following before you upgrade the sever firmware:

● Ensure that you are connected and have configured the iDRAC.
● Ensure that ACM is up and running.

NOTE: The Appliance Configuration Manager SSH session is configured to time out after 10 minutes of inactivity. Either
refresh the session to keep it alive or change the timeout value. For more information, see the Session timeout section in
the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance Security Configuration Guide.

● Ensure that you have valid connection points to the required Hypervisor Server.
● Pause all backup/maintenance activities.
● Ensure that all the services on ACM have green checkmarks indicating that they are all healthy, up and running, and properly

configured. If any of the services are not in green, log in that particular service and restart it.

● Download the required firmware upgrade packages from the Dell EMC support website to your local folder.
● Use the sha256 checksum validation process to verify its integrity.
● Ensure that the ACM is up and running.
● Download the latest DPA Tools package from the Dell EMC support website to your local folder and use the sha256

checksum to verify its integrity.

● On the ACM GUI, click the Download Current Configuration to generate the DataProtectionConfiguration.xml

file that is required for enabling the service mode.

NOTE: The DataProtectionConfiguration.xml file is automatically generated for PowerProtect DP Series
Appliance version 2.5 and later.

NOTE: The Appliance Configuration Manager SSH session is configured to time out after 10 minutes of inactivity. Either
refresh the session to keep it alive or change the timeout value. For more information, see the Session timeout section in
the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance Security Configuration Guide.

Upgrade the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance

77

To upgrade the server firmware manually, perform the following:

Install the DPA Tools package
Install the firmware update package

1.
2.
3. Update the firmware (ACM configured systems only)

Install the DPATools Package

IDPA 2.7.6 is bundled with DPATools CLI version 3.1.0.0-1. Ensure that you download the appropriate DPATools version from the
Dell EMC Support website. Alternatively, see the Software Compatibility Guide for supported versions of any IDPA component.

Steps

1. Using an SSH client, connect to the ACM as a root user.

2. Create a directory by running the following command:

mkdir /root/firmware/

3. Downloaded the latest IDPA_DPATOOLS-3.1.0.0-1.zip from the Dell EMC Support site and extract the files.
4. Copy the dpatools-3.1.0.0-1.rpm to the new /root/firmware/ directory.
5. On the SSH session, verify the version of DPATools that is installed on the ACM.

rpm -qa dpatools.

The following is a sample output of this command: dpatools-3.1.0.0-1.x86_64

6.

If the version that you downloaded is a later version than the one already installed, then upgrade the DPATools package by
running the following.

rpm -Uvh --force dpatools-3.1.0.0-1.rpm

Install the Firmware Update Package

Steps

1. Using an SSH client, connect to the ACM as a root user.

2. Verify the firmware version on the appliance.

dpacli -fwversions

The dpacli -fwversions command displays the firmware version of all components on the appliance server.

3. Downloaded the latest IDPA_Firmware_Gen14_Update_NovPlus_2022_Package.zip from the Dell EMC Support

site and extract the files.

4. Using WinSCP or any other terminal emulation applications, copy the dpafw-3.1.0.0-1.rpm to the root directory.
5. Run the following command:

rpm -Uvh --force dpafw-3.1.0.0-1.rpm

Update the Firmware (for ACM configured systems only)

Perform the following steps to update the firmware:

Steps

1. Connect to the ACM using an SSH client.

2. Confirm that the payload has the required files:

ls -thrl /usr/local/dpatools/bin/payload/

Expected output:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 572M Jan 8 21:59 IDPA-2.316-2.316.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 143M Jan 8 22:44 IDPA-10.308-10.308.tar.gz

3. On the ACM, start the firmware update workflow by running the following command:

78

Upgrade the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance

dpacli -fwworkflow /usr/local/dpatools/bin/payload/IDPA-2.316-2.316.tar.gz

4. Monitor the dpacli log file by running the following command:
tail -f /usr/local/dpatools/logs/dpacli.log

5. Optionally, you can monitor the progress of the firmware update on the iDRAC user interface by accessing Maintenance >

Job Queue.

NOTE: The firmware update process including restarting the server can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

After the firmware updates are completed successfully, the Storage Pool for DP5900 should be in a healthy state. You can
run the dpacli -fwprecheck command on the ACM to check if the firmware is updated properly.

If the Storage Pool is not in a healthy state, you can recover the Storage Pool using the following steps:

a. Enable Maintenance mode on all Hypervisor hosts.
b. Shut down all the Hypervisor hosts (power off).
c. Power on the Hypervisor hosts one at a time.

NOTE: Ensure that the Hypervisor host is up and running before powering on the next Hypervisor host. Health checks
fail until the second Hypervisor host has joined the cluster.

Firmware block versions

Once the firmware is upgraded, check the table to below to validate if the firmware block version for the hardware components
is correct.

The table below lists the firmware versions of the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance 2.7.2 hardware components.

NOTE: You can verify the firmware block version on the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance by running the dpacli
-fwversions command from the ACM service. It displays the firmware block version of all the hardware components on
the PowerProtect DP Series Appliance Server.

The following table details the firmware block versions of the DP4400 PowerProtect DP Series Appliance 2.7.2 hardware
components. See the table below to check if you must upgrade the firmware of any of your hardware components.

Self-contained deployment (optional)

Self-contained deployment refers to configuring the appliance network using the ACM IP for DNS, NTP, and Gateway. This is
an optional task. These steps can be used for initial appliance configuration and for Cyber Recovery configuration. Perform this
task only if you do not have a valid IP address for DNS, NTP, and Gateway. After the appliance is deployed and configured
successfully, you can change the DNS, NTP, and Gateway from the ACM dashboard.

Prerequisites

● Self-contained deployment is supported only on the IPv4 network.

NOTE: You cannot configure the ACM as DNS and NTP on a IPv6 network.

● In a single network configuration, there should be at least two uplinks that are connected to the switch.

Perform the following temporary workaround if you do not have two uplinks:

Assign two temporary IPs in different subnets (subnet should be different than Protection Storage management IP) to
Protection Storage backup IPs. These IPs do not require DNS entries. After the deployment, change the Protection Storage
IPs assigned to these NICs and update the Protection Storage ifgroup. This workaround prevents the Protection Storage
configuration failure.

NOTE: The user must plug two temporary network cables from a personal switch to emulate a network connection, as it
is required during initial deployment.

About this task

Perform the following steps when you are on the Network Configuration page on ACM.

Steps

1. Open an SSH session as a root user on ACM using a private IP.
2. Run the command:

cd /usr/local/dataprotection/var/configmgr/server_data/config/

3. Open the file commonconfig.xml using vi editor:

vi commonconfig.xml

4. Find the following tags:

<configureAcmDNS>false</configureAcmDNS>

<configureAcmNTP>false</configureAcmNTP>

5. Change the values of the tags based on the mode of deployment:

● To configure DNS, set the value of the tag configureAcmDNS as true
● To configure NTP, set the value of the tag configureAcmNTP as true

6. Save the commonconfig.xml file.
7. Perform these steps to configure DNS:

a. Run the command: cd /usr/local/dataprotection/customscripts/
b. Open the file dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties using vi editor:

vi dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties

The content of the file depends on the appliance model. Verify if the required keys are present in the file, else you can
add them manually.

c. Enter the required IPs, hostname mapping, and other details as per the keys present in the file. See the following

guidelines for updating the file:

● To use the IP range for assigning IP addresses and host names to the respective components, see IP address

requirements .

92

Self-contained deployment (optional)

NOTE: IP range validation is not supported in self-contained deployment.

● For a single network, leave the separate backup network fields blank.
●

NOTE: Enter the short hostname and not the FQDN.

● Hostname entries must not contain underscore (_).
● Enter the IP address or hostname for the optional components (Reporting and Analytics, Search, Cloud DR, and

Cyber Recovery). If the corresponding IP addresses or hostnames are not added in the file during deployment, then
the optional components cannot be deployed from the ACM dashboard later while ACM is being used as DNS.

d. Save the dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties file.
e. Go to the ACM Network Configuration page on the Internet browser and refresh the page.

The Network Configuration page should be automatically populated if the
dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties file is updated with all the required fields.

8. Enter the ACM IP in the NTP server IP Address field.

9. Click Submit.

Results

● After you configure basic networking, your web browser automatically redirects to the ACM IP address assigned during

network configuration.

NOTE: For automatic forwarding to work correctly, the computer you use to complete the configuration must be
connected to the same network as the configured ACM IP address.

● If you cannot have connections to both public and private networks simultaneously, disconnect from the private appliance

configuration network and then connect to the network that the ACM IP address is on to complete the rest of the
configuration.

● If the network configuration fails, you can click Rollback to revert all the settings. Review the settings, modify if required,

and then configure the network settings again.

Next steps

● After the network configuration is complete, revert the network adapter IP address settings on the service computer to their

previous state.

● After completing the network configuration, see Configure the DP4400 Software for the steps to install and deploy the

appliance.

● For adding new IP addresses and hostname entries in the DNS running as ACM, see Add IPs and hostname entries.
● After deploying the appliance, you can change the DNS, NTP, and Gateway IP addresses from the ACM dashboard. It is

recommended to use customer provided IP address for DNS, NTP, and Gateway. See the PowerProtect DP series appliance
Product Guide for more information.

Add IPs and hostname entries

This section describes the steps to add the IP addresses and hostname entries to the DNS server running as ACM.

About this task

Perform these steps to add the IPs and hostname entries:

Steps

1. Go to the directory /var/lib/named/master on ACM using the command:

cd /var/lib/named/master

Self-contained deployment (optional)

93

2. Add IPs and hostname entries (similar to other entries present in the file) at the end of the following two files. Ensure to add

the . at the end of FQDN while adding the entries.

NOTE: Apart from adding the new IPs and hostnames to the files, do not modify any other content.

● Forward lookup - <domain_name> file

Where, domain_name is the domain name mentioned in the file usr/local/dataprotection/customscripts/
dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties during network configuration.

● Reverse lookup - <first three octets of reverse subnet IP>.in-addr.arpa file. For example,

xx.xx.xx.in-addr.arpa

Where, xx.xx.xx is the reversed subnet mentioned in the file /usr/local/dataprotection/customscripts/
dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties during network configuration.

For example, in the dns_ip_hostname_mappings.properties file, if the domain name is abc.com and the subnet is
10.10.11.0/24, the filenames for forward lookup and reverse lookup are abc.com and 11.10.10.in-addr.arpa, respectively.

To add IP and hostname entries, add them to the end of the following two files. The subsequent screens display the file
content after adding the new entries for Search (with IP 10.10.11.3 and FQDN dps.abc.com) at the end.

abc.com file content:

acm         IN    A         10.10.11.2
search      IN    A         10.10.11.3

11.10.10.in-addr.arpa file content:

2.11.10.10.in-addr.arpa   IN    PTR      acm.abc.com.
3.11.10.10.in-addr.arpa   IN    PTR      dps.abc.com.

3. Restart the named service using the command:

service named restart

Configure ACM as NTP server

This section describes the steps to make the ACM as the NTP server.

About this task

server 127.127.1.0 # local clock
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
restrict default kod nomodify notrap
restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap

2. Restart the ntpd service and make the changes persistent across reboots.

systemctl restart ntpd
systemctl enable ntpd

3. Run the following command to check the status of ntpd.

systemctl status ntpd

4. Wait for 5 min so that the ACM can sync itself.

Use the command ntpq -p to verify.

Appliance configuration

This section describes the appliance network configuration through ACM.

About this task

Perform the following steps for appliance network configuration through ACM.

Steps

1. On the Network configuration page, provide the ACM IP address for DNS.

2. Assign the NTP IP address as 192.168.100.100. This step is temporary in order to get through ACM validation.

3. Assign either the gateway IP as ACM or the customer provided gateway IP.
4. After successful network configuration, update the /etc/ntp.conf file with the content that is mentioned in Configure

ACM as NTP server.
This step is required as ACM network configuration overwrites ntp.conf.

5. Restart the NTP service and wait for 5 min so that ACM can again sync with itself.

Inbound ports for the Azure network security group

This section describes the rules that should be added to an Azure network security group.

The following tables describe the rules that should be added to an Azure network security group:

NOTE: If you want to restrict the source traffic, set the source with IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block, or a single IPv4 or IPv6
address.

NOTE: Protection Software no longer supports HTTP access to TCP port 80. Use the HTTPS ports 443 to access these
services instead.

For all table entries:

● The Source and Destination fields are Any.
● The Source port range field is *
● The Action is Allow.
● Assign a unique priority value to each rule, starting at 100.
● Type a unique description for each rule. The value must be unique for both inbound and outbound rules.

This section describes the outbound ports for the Azure network security group.

NOTE: If you want to restrict the source of traffic, set the source with IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block, or a single IPv4 or IPv6
address.

By default, Azure has a rule AllowInternetOutBound with priority 65001 to allow all outbound internet traffic. Override this rule
by adding a rule with a priority (that is, an integer number) that is greater than all customized rules' priority, and less than
65000: source: *, destination: *, protocol: *, action: Deny. Azure documentation contains information
about creating a firewall rule.

For all table entries:

● The Source and Destination fields are Any.
● The Source port range field is *
● The Action is Allow.
● Assign a unique priority value to each rule, starting at 100.
● Type a unique description for each rule. The value must be unique for both inbound and outbound rules.
