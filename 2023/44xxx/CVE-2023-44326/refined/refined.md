- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which is a type of memory access error that occurs when a program attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer. This is classified as CWE-125.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability.
