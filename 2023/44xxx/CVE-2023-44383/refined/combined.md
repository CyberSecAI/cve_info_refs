# Stored XSS by authenticated backend user with improper configuration

Low

[daftspunk](/daftspunk)
published
GHSA-rvx8-p3xp-fj3p
Nov 29, 2023

## Package

composer

october/system
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>3.0

## Patched versions

3.5.2

## Description

### Impact

A user with access to the media manager that stores SVG files could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other user with access to the media manager when SVG files are supported.

SVG files are supported by default in v3 for convenience; however, this has resulted in multiple mistaken vulnerability reports from security researchers. As per the documentation, if a backend user is not trusted, the advice is to remove the `svg` extension from the list of supported file types.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in v3.5.2 by including an SVG sanister. It is enabled by default for new installations but must be enabled for existing sites in the **config/media.php** file.

```
'clean_vectors' => true,

```
### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade for this patch, follow the pervious advice and remove `svg` from the supported file types.
