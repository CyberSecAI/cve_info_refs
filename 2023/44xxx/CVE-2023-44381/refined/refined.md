- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated backend user with specific CMS permissions can bypass the `cms.safe_mode` setting by crafting a special request that includes PHP code in a CMS template.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation or sanitization allows injection of PHP code despite `cms.safe_mode` being enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting it into a CMS template, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted request to the CMS template functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user with one of the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions.
