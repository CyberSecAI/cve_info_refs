# Stored cross site scripting via the title property in the Zope management interface

Low

[dataflake](/dataflake)
published
GHSA-m755-gxxg-r5qh
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

pip

Zope
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.8.11, < 5.8.6

## Patched versions

4.8.11, 5.8.6

## Description

### Impact

The title property, available on most Zope objects, can be used to store script code that is executed while viewing the affected object in the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) because the title property is displayed unquoted in the breadcrumbs element. All versions of Zope 4 and Zope 5 are affected.

### Patches

Patches will be released with Zope versions 4.8.11 and 5.8.6

### Workarounds

Make sure only Manager users can edit and view Zope objects in the Zope Management Interface. This is the default.

### Severity

Low

3.1

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-44389
