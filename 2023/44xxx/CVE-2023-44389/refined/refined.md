The provided content relates to CVE-2023-44389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `title` property of Zope objects is displayed unquoted in the breadcrumbs element of the Zope Management Interface (ZMI). This allows for the injection of script code within the title.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary script code within the context of the user's browser session when viewing an affected object in the ZMI. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to edit the title property of Zope objects. This is generally limited to users with 'Manager' roles within Zope, which is the default configuration.
- The attacker must also know that the title property is displayed unquoted in breadcrumbs.
- The attacker needs to persuade a victim user to view the affected object in ZMI, which executes the payload in the user's browser.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Zope versions prior to 4.8.11 and 5.8.6
- Patches are available in Zope versions 4.8.11 and 5.8.6.
- The fix involves using `html_quote` on the title property in `src/App/dtml/manage_tabs.dtml` file
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 3.1 which is considered 'Low' severity.
