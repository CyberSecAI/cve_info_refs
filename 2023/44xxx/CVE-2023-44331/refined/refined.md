- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. This leads to an out-of-bounds read
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak, which can lead to information disclosure
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction (opening a specially crafted file)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need to convince a user to open a malicious file. No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
