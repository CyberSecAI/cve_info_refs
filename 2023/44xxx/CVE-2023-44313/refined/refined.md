**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can obtain sensitive server information by leveraging the SSRF vulnerability to make requests to internal or external resources that the server has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request via the frontend API of the Apache ServiceComb Service-Center.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the frontend API of the Apache ServiceComb Service-Center. This means they need network access to the service.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache ServiceComb Service-Center versions up to and including 2.1.0 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to version 2.2.0, where the issue is fixed.
