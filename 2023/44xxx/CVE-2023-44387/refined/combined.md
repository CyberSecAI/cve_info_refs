This is a patch release for 7.6. We recommend using 7.6.3 instead of 7.6.

This release addresses two security vulnerabilities:

* [Incorrect permission assignment for symlinked files used in copy or archiving operations](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-43r3-pqhv-f7h9)
* [Possible local text file exfiltration by XML External entity injection](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-mrff-q8qj-xvg8)

It also fixes the following issues:

* [#25781](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25781) Backport finalized task performance fix to 7.6.x
* [#25802](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25802) Backport cgroups fix to 7.6.x

[Read the Release Notes](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/release-notes.html)

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 7.6.3 by updating your wrapper:

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=7.6.3

```

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.3/userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_7.6) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle 7.6.3.

## Reporting Problems

If you find a problem with this release, please file a bug on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues) adhering to our issue guidelines.

If you're not sure you're encountering a bug, please use the [forum](https://discuss.gradle.org/c/help-discuss).

# Incorrect permission assignment for symlinked files used in copy or archiving operations

Low

[ljacomet](/ljacomet)
published
GHSA-43r3-pqhv-f7h9
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

Gradle
(Java)

## Affected versions

<7.6.3, <8.4

## Patched versions

7.6.3, 8.4

## Description

### Impact

When copying files or creating archives, Gradle does not preserve symbolic links. Instead, Gradle resolves symbolic links to their underlying target file. The permissions of the new file are the permissions of the symbolic link instead of the permissions of the target file.

This can lead to files that have unintended permissions because symbolic links are usually world readable and writeable.

While it is unlikely this impacts the build directly, it may open attack vectors where build artifacts are used or extracted.

### Patches

In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, the permissions of the target file will be used when copying or archiving a symbolic link.

It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade to a patched Gradle version, you should [explicitly set permissions for any symbolic links](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:setting_file_permissions) when copying or creating an archive.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
