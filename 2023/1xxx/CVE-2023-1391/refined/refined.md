Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an unrestricted file upload in the `ab.php` file of the Online Tours & Travels Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate or restrict the type of files that can be uploaded through `ab.php`. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts.
- **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The vulnerability exists because the system fails to check if the uploaded file has a potentially harmful extension like `.php`, allowing execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file (e.g., `123.php`) containing malicious code, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could lead to:
    - **Data breach:** Access to sensitive data stored on the server, including user information and system files
    - **System takeover:** Complete control of the server, allowing the attacker to install backdoors, modify files, or launch further attacks.
    - **Denial of Service:** Disruption of the service by crashing the server or overloading its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `ab.php` endpoint, including the malicious PHP file in the `img` parameter.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request utilizes multipart form data to upload the file, indicating the attacker can manipulate form data to inject malicious payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL (`ip/tour/admin/ab.php`) and the required POST parameters (file input name `img`, submit).
- **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to forge HTTP POST requests with multipart form data.
- **Authentication is not explicitly required:** The provided information does not mention if the vulnerability is protected by authentication. However, based on the file path it might be assumed that the admin panel might be exposed.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided HTTP request demonstrates how to upload a file with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`.
- The file is uploaded to the `\tour\admin\img` directory on the server.
- The filename provided in the request is used by the application and if it is a php file, it will be executed if accessed.
