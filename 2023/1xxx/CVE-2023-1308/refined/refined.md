Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the `adminlog.php` file of an Online Graduate Tracer System for College of ICT Alumni, built using PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `user` parameter in the `adminlog.php` file. The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
- Attackers may gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative interface.
- Attackers could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/tracking/admin/adminlog.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is `user`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker manipulates the `user` parameter by injecting SQL code, specifically `' or '1'='1`.
- The attacker has knowledge of the vulnerable application and its login mechanism to create a functional payload.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The application was built using phpstudy 8.1.1.3.
- The specific vulnerable file is `tracking/admin/adminlog.php`.
- The provided payload shows a login bypass attempt by manipulating the `user` field with `' or '1'='1` to force the SQL query to return results even when the username doesn't match. The `password` field is included, although it's not needed for the login bypass given the SQL injection.
- The host used in the example is `www.testcms.com`, suggesting a testing environment.
