- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the URL path. The vulnerable file `index.php` within the captcha demo of jquery-validation-1.11.1 plugin reflects the unsanitized part of the URL path.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application reflects the attacker-controlled part of the URL in the response without sanitization

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable page, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can be leveraged to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes javascript code after the filename `index.php`. The user must be tricked into visiting the malicious link (through social engineering or other methods).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim to click on it.
