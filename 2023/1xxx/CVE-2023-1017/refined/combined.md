## TCG TPM2.0 implementations vulnerable to memory corruption

#### Vulnerability Note VU#782720

Original Release Date: 2023-02-28 | Last Revised: 2024-07-09

---

### Overview

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 reference library specification, currently at [Level 00, Revision 01.59 November 2019](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part4_SuppRoutines_code_pub.pdf). An attacker who has access to a TPM-command interface can send maliciously-crafted commands to the module and trigger these vulnerabilities. This allows either read-only access to sensitive data or overwriting of normally protected data that is only available to the TPM (e.g., cryptographic keys).

### Description

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is a hardware-based solution that provides secure cryptographic functions to the operating systems on modern computers, making it resistant to tampering. As cloud computing and virtualization have become more popular in recent years, software-based TPM implementations have also gained popularity. TPM can be implemented in the form of Discrete, Integrated or Firmware TPM in its hardware form. The virtual TPM's exists in Hypervisor form or in a purely software-based TPM implementation e.g., [swtpm](https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/wiki). The [Trusted Computing Group](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org) (TCG) is responsible for maintaining the TPM specifications, which are actively contributed to by both hardware and software manufacturers. The TCG released the TPM 2.0 specifications in October 2014 and has since revised them multiple times. The latest version, Revision 01.59, was released in November 2019. Many TPM hardware and software manufacturers use these specifications to build firmware that complies with standards and provides a secure interface to sensitive cryptographic data. TPM is employed in a variety of devices, from specialized enterprise-grade hardware to Internet of Things (IoT) appliances.

The [TPM Library Specification Architecture](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part1_Architecture_pub.pdf) documents "Session-based encryption" that allows a cryptographic client application to perform various operations, including those that provide [Parameter Encryption](https://www.wolfssl.com/tpm-parameter-encryption/) capabilities. Session-based encryption may be used to ensure confidentiality of these parameters. The operating system or the client software relies on the TPM to securely provide capabilities such as Cipher Feedback (CFB) for block cipher or streaming hash-based XOR obfuscation of the intended parameter payloads.

Quarkslab security researchers found two vulnerabilities in the way the TPM reference specification processes some of these parameters that are part of TPM commands. An Out Of Bound (OOB) read vulnerability in the `CryptParameterDecryption()` routine allowed a 2-byte read access to data that was not part of the current session. It was also possible to write 2-bytes past the end of the current command buffer resulting in corruption of memory.

An attacker with access to a device built with a vulnerable version of the TPM can trigger this bug by sending crafted commands to the TPM. The vulnerable TPM can thus be tricked to access data that is not part of the intended operation. As the OS relies on the TPM firmware for these functions, it may be difficult to detect or prevent such access using traditional host-based security capabilities.

### Impact

An authenticated, local attacker could send maliciously crafted commands to a vulnerable TPM allowing access to sensitive data. In some cases, the attacker can also overwrite protected data in the TPM firmware. This may lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution within the TPM. Because the attacker's payload runs within the TPM, it may be undetectable by other components of the target device.

### Solution

***Apply an update***
The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has released an update to their [Errata for TPM2.0 Library Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/errata-for-tpm-library-specification-2-0/) with instructions to address these vulnerabilities. To ensure the security of their systems, users should apply any updates provided by hardware and software manufacturers through their supply chain as soon as possible. Updating the firmware of TPM chips may be necessary, and this can be done through an OS vendor or the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In some cases, the OEM may require resetting the TPM to its original factory default values as part of the update process.

Users in high-assurance computing environments should consider using TPM [Remote Attestation](https://tpm2-software.github.io/tpm2-tss/getting-started/2019/12/18/Remote-Attestation.html) to detect any changes to devices and ensure their TPM is tamper proofed. As these attacks involve TPM-based software, mechanisms such as user-password or PIN protection and tpm-totp do not protect against attacks leveraging the vulnerabilities discussed in this article.

**Note:**  the [TCG's Errata](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/errata-for-tpm-library-specification-2-0//) covers a larger scope and addresses additional security issues beyond the two vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Francisco Falcon and Ivan Arce of Quarkslab who researched and reported these vulnerabilities, respectively. The TCG and their members worked closely with us and other vendors to coordinate the disclosure of these vulnerabilities. Note that the Immune Gmbh's <https://github.com/immune-gmbh/tpm-vuln-checker> software has added support for detecting this vulnerability.

### [libtpms IBM sponsored](#libtpms%20IBM%20sponsored) Affected

Notified:  2023-01-23
Updated: 2023-08-21

**Statement Date:   January 23, 2023**

| **CVE-2023-1017** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **Vendor Statement:** | |
| I agree that the CryptParameterDecryption() function has a potential vulnerability with an out-of-bounds write access since the input buffer per VU #782720.1 lacks proper bounds checking and the input buffer here is also the output buffer. | |
| **CVE-2023-1018** | Affected |
| **Vendor Statement:** | |
| I agree that there's a potential out-of-bounds \*\*read\*\* vulnerability in CryptParameterDecryption() that is due to the usage of BYTE\_ARRAY\_TO\_UINT16(buffer) without prior checking of the bufferSize parameter. if(leadingSizeInByte == 2) { // The first two bytes of the buffer are the size of the // data to be decrypted cipherSize = (UINT32)BYTE\_ARRAY\_TO\_UINT16(buffer); buffer = &buffer[2]; // advance the buffer } #ifdef TPM4B else if(leadingSizeInByte == 4) { // the leading size is four bytes so get the four byte size field cipherSize = BYTE\_ARRAY\_TO\_UINT32(buffer); buffer = &buffer[4]; //advance pointer } #endif else { FAIL(FATAL\_ERROR\_INTERNAL); } if(cipherSize > bufferSize) return TPM\_RC\_SIZE; I think before this block there should be a check like this IF TCG wants to stick with the macro: if (bufferSize < leadingSizeInByte) return TPM\_RC\_SIZE; bufferSize -= leadingSizeInByte; This then also corrects the if(ciphersize > bufferSize) check. | |

#### Vendor Statement

I agree that there's a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the CryptParameterDecryption function due to a missing statement checking the input buffer size. Since the input buffer also serves as the output buffer the same function also has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the case that the read vulnerability has been triggered.

### [NetBSD](#NetBSD) Affected

Notified:  2022-12-01
Updated: 2023-08-21

**Statement Date:   June 18, 2023**

| **CVE-2023-1017** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2023-1018** | Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

NetBSD is not affected because it not ship the TPM reference implementation or anything based on it.

If NetBSD runs on a machine with a TPM whose firmware is vulnerable, it could used to exploit the TPM, but the same is true of any other operating system running on the same machine. Access to the TPM device node, which is disabled by default, is normally privileged in NetBSD.

pkgsrc users on any operating system may be vulnerable if they have elected to install the security/libtpms or security/swtpm packages and to and expose them to an adversary.

If you identify a vulnerability in our specifications, reference code, and reference documents please report it immediately. Reports can be sent to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5221373127203b262b1226202721263736313d3f2227263b3c3535203d27227c3d2035). Timely identification of security vulnerabilities is critical to mitigating potential risks to our adopters. When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the below information to help us better understand the nature and scope of the reported issue:

* Finder’s email
* Vulnerability Description (Include vulnerability details and how to reproduce the issue)
* The version label for the affected software or document
* Finder’s PGP public key if available or via standard means

Please note that the TCG is currently limited to inquiries and responses written in English.

## **Handling security vulnerabilities**

TCG monitors for submissions and acknowledges initial receipt within 3 business days. The vulnerability response activities will be tailored to the circumstances and will generally proceed as follows: 1) Triage report 2) Remediation determined 3) Communication plan 4) Mitigation 5) Response.

TCG strives to provide the remedy or corrective action in the shortest commercially reasonable time. Response timelines will depend on many factors, such as the severity, the remedy complexity, the affected component (e.g., some updates require longer validation cycles or can only be updated in a major release), or the stage of the product within its lifecycle, among others. TCG VRT will coordinate with the finder throughout the vulnerability investigation and provide the finder with updates on case progress.

## **Coordinated Disclosure Practices**

TCG follows multi-party coordinated disclosure practices, under which vulnerabilities are generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are made available to customers. This allows the vendors the opportunity to triage and offer tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before any involved party discloses detailed vulnerability or exploit information to the public. Multi-party coordinated disclosure industry best practices is designed to protect technology adopters. Public disclosure of a potential vulnerability before mitigations are deployed could allow adversaries to exploit the vulnerability.

In most cases, TCG will disclose mitigations through TCG Security Advisories where applicable. The TCG Security Advisories will typically include the following information:

* Date of publication
* CVE ID’s
* CVSS v3.1 scoring
* Details of the vulnerability in the affected TCG specification and potential impacts
* Erratum
  + Remediation or workaround, if any (link)
* Acknowledge the finder and/or the finder’s organization

**Severity Rating**

A security vulnerability is classified by its severity rating, which is determined by many factors, including the level of effort required to exploit a vulnerability as well as the potential impact to data or business activities from a successful exploit. TCG uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) to identify the severity level of identified vulnerabilities. The [full standard](https://www.first.org/cvss) is maintained by FIRST.

**Disclaimer**

This Vulnerability Response Policy (“Policy”) does not constitute a warranty or alter the terms of any license with respect to any TCG-developed technology.  TCG reserves the right to change or update this Policy without notice at any time and on a case-by-case basis.  Response is not guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Title: TPM 2.0 library memory corruption vulnerabilities

ID: TCGVRT0007

Released: 2023-FEB-28

Overview:

Vulnerabilities  were  found  in  the  TPM  2.0  reference  implementation  code  published  by  the
Trusted  Computing  Group,  Revisions  1.59,  1.38  and  1.16  which  could  potentially  result  in
information disclosure or escalation of privilege.

 (https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/)  is  prone  to  two
potential  vulnerabilities,  as  initially  identified  by  security  researchers  from  Quarks  Lab.  The
reported  vulnerabilities  occur  when  handling  malicious  TPM  2.0  commands  with  encrypted
parameters.  Both  vulnerabilities  are  in  the  `CryptParameterDecryption`  function,  which  is
defined in the [Part 4: Supporting Routines – (Code] (https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-
content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part4_SuppRoutines_code_pub.pdf)  document,  section
"10.2.6.6.6  -  CryptParameterDecryption()".  One  of  the  vulnerabilities  is  an  out-of-bounds  read
identified as CVE-2023-1018 . The second one is an out-of-bounds write identified as CVE-2023-
1017. These vulnerabilities can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious
commands to a TPM 2.0 whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation.
Additional instances may be identified because of the TPM Work Group ongoing analysis and
may result in a larger scope of potential vulnerabilities included in TCGVRT0007.

Description:

The reference code did not implement appropriate length checks resulting in potential buffer
overflows. The buffer overflows occur on the buffer passed to the ExecuteCommand() entry
point (detailed in Part 4 of the spec.) CVE-2023-1017 may allow an attacker to write 2 bytes past
the end of that buffer.  Those 2 bytes can be written, with attacker-specified values, and
therefore the impact assessment depends on what is at that memory location, which may vary
across various TPM implementations & vendors.  In some implementations the two bytes in
question may be unused memory (e.g. in case of certain static buffers), or it could have live data
(e.g. if the buffer is on the stack.) CVE-2023-1018 may allow an attacker to read 2 bytes past the
end of that buffer.

Impact:

Exploitation on vulnerable systems may result in local information disclosure or escalation of
privileges.

Solution and Protective Measures:

Review and implement TCG publications:

1.  TPM 2.0 library Specifications v1.59 Errata Version 1.4 or higher. Section 2.6.1 applies to

both CVE-2023-1017 (OOB Write) and CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read). Section 2.6.2 addresses
CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read)). Section 2.6.3 addresses CVE-2023-1017 (OOB Write).

2.  TPM 2.0 library Specifications v1.38 Errata Version 1.13 or higher. Section 2.38.1 applies to

both CVE-2023-1017 (OOB Write) and CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read). Section 2.38.2 addresses
CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read). Section 2.38.3 addresses CVE-2023-1017 (OOB Write).

3.  TPM 2.0 library Specifications v1.16 Errata Version 1.6 or higher. Section 2.31.1 applies to

both CVE-2023-1017 (OOB Write) and CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read). Section 2.31.2 addresses
CVE-2023-1018 (OOB Read).

Acknowledgment: The vulnerabilities were found by Francisco Falcon from Quarkslab  and
reported to the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) and subsequently reported to the TCG
VRT. Additional instances affecting the reference code were found by Vadim Sukhomlinov of
Google. The TCG VRT would like to thank Francisco Falcon, Vadim Sukhomlinov and the
CERT/CC for a coordinated vulnerability disclosure with TPM Vendors and the ecosystem.
