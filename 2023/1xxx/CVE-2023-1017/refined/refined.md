{
  "CVE-2023-1017": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing length check in the CryptParameterDecryption function within the TPM 2.0 reference library, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the CryptParameterDecryption function.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local access can overwrite 2 bytes of data beyond the current command buffer in the TPM's memory. This can lead to corruption of normally protected data, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution within the TPM. The impact is implementation-dependent.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to a vulnerable TPM can send a specially crafted command with encrypted parameters to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with access to the TPM command interface."
  },
  "CVE-2023-1018": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `CryptParameterDecryption` routine of the TPM 2.0 reference implementation, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `CryptParameterDecryption` function due to missing check on input buffer size.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local access can read 2 bytes of sensitive data from outside the current session's boundaries. This can lead to information disclosure. The attacker might be able to access data not part of the intended operation, which is normally protected by the TPM.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker sending a malicious command to the TPM via its command interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with access to a TPM-command interface."
