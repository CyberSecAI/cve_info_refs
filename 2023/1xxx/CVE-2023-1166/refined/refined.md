- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in some settings fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the settings page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker needs to have admin or other high-privilege access to the WordPress site's admin panel. They can then access the plugin settings and insert a malicious payload into a text field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) on the WordPress site.
