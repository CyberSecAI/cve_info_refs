Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WP Tiles plugin fails to properly check the post status (draft, private, etc.) before displaying post titles. This allows any authenticated user (including subscribers) to retrieve titles of posts that should not be accessible to them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin directly uses the `post_status` parameter from the shortcode without proper authorization checks.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to post titles of draft and private posts, which can contain sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve titles of private or draft posts, potentially revealing sensitive content, upcoming product launches, internal strategies, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests.
*   **Shortcode Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a shortcode with a specific `post_status` parameter (e.g., `draft`, `private`, `any`) within a `parse-media-shortcode` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. Even a subscriber account has sufficient permissions to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Access to the site:** The attacker needs to be able to access the site to execute the exploit.
