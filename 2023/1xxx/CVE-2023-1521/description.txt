On Linux the sccache client can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a local sccache server, by preloading the code in a shared library passed to LD_PRELOAD.


If the server is run as root (which is the default when installing the  snap package https://snapcraft.io/sccache ), this means a user running the sccache client can get root privileges.
