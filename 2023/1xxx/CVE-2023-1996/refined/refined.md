**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1996

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** **3D**EXPERIENCE

**Affected Versions:** Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2018x through Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2023x

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.

**Weaknesses:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within a user's browser session. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Defacement of web pages.
  - Stealing of sensitive information.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript code.
- The victim is tricked into clicking the malicious URL.
- The web application reflects the malicious script back to the victim's browser, which then executes it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious URL (e.g., through social engineering or by hosting the link on a public forum).
- The attacker doesn't need any privileges or access to the server other than the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application.
