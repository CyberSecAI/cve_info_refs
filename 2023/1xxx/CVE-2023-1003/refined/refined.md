Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Typora, a markdown editor, fails to properly filter `.js` files on Windows. Although Typora filters other dangerous file extensions, it retains `.js`, which is associated with Windows Script Host (WSH) JScript. This allows users to potentially execute code by simply clicking on a specially crafted markdown file that contains a link to a malicious .js file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Filtering:** Typora does not properly filter `.js` files, which are executable via WSH on Windows.
- **Lack of User Awareness:** The vulnerability leverages the user's default file association behavior on Windows, where .js files may be set to be executed by WSH.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. In the provided example, the code opens the calculator application, which demonstrates the capability for more malicious actions.
- **Compromise of System:** Attackers could potentially gain full control of the affected machine, depending on the code injected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown Files:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted markdown file (`poc.md`) in Typora. This file contains a link (either direct or via HTML) to a malicious `.js` file (such as `poc.js`).
- **User Interaction:**  The user must click on the link to trigger the vulnerability. If the .js file is associated with WSH the click will execute the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft a Malicious .js File:** The attacker needs to create a JavaScript file that contains malicious code.
- **Create a Malicious Markdown File:** The attacker needs to craft a markdown file that includes a link to the malicious `.js` file.
- **Distribution of Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious markdown file to the victim (e.g., via email, shared storage etc.)

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example includes a `poc.md` that, when opened in Typora, links to a `poc.js` file. The `poc.js` file contains the code to launch calculator via WSH.
- The `poc.md` can trigger an automatic download of the `poc.js` file, if an html section containing javascript to do so is used, or a user click to download can also be used by using a `<a href>` tag.
- A user's configuration of setting WSH as the default program for `.js` files makes the vulnerability exploitable.
- The issue was fixed in Typora version 1.5.8.
