The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `transactioncode` parameter in the `/FriendlyIsPizzaWebsite/cashconfirm.php` script is vulnerable to XSS. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page or interact with the vulnerable application. This can lead to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions within the user's context.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/FriendlyIsPizzaWebsite/cashconfirm.php`
- The `transactioncode` POST parameter is used to inject the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, they need to be able to control the `transactioncode` parameter.
- No specific privileges are required.
