{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when saving a new admin user, allowing malicious script to be stored in the database.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the page, and potentially other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker submits a crafted payload containing JavaScript code through the 'fullname' field when adding a new admin user via the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to access the admin page and have the permissions to add a new user."
