  "CVE-2023-1055": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Type": "Vulnerability",
      "Description": "RHDS: LDAP browser tries to decode userPassword instead of userCertificate attribute",
    },
    "Root cause": "The LDAP browser in Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) attempts to decode the `userPassword` attribute instead of the `userCertificate` attribute when browsing entries.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect attribute handling during LDAP browsing",
      "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with a local account and access to `cockpit-389-ds` could list processes and expose hashed passwords, potentially leading to data confidentiality breach.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to a system running `cockpit-389-ds`",
      "Exploiting the LDAP browser functionality within RHDS"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": [
      "Local system account",
      "Access to `cockpit-389-ds`"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is due to the `showCertificate()` function using the wrong attribute during the decoding process. The vulnerable code is present in all versions of RHDS that include the LDAP Browser (versions 11.5, 11.6, 12.0 and 12.1). This vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.3.5-1.fc38 of 389-ds-base and corresponding Red Hat Directory Server updates."
