The provided content is related to CVE-2023-1157.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a crafted ELF file that triggers a read of a wild pointer in `elf_parser::Elf_parser::get_segments()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue due to dereferencing a wild pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash, as demonstrated by the ASAN report and GDB output.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted malicious ELF file that, when parsed, leads to the dereferencing of a wild pointer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable application, which uses the `elf-parser` library.
