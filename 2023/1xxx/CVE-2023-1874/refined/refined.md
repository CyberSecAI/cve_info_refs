{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of authorization checks in the `multiple_roles_update` function of the WP Data Access plugin. This function allows users to modify their roles by providing the `wpda_role[]` parameter during a profile update, without proper verification of their permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Privilege Assignment",
       "Lack of authorization checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with minimal permissions (e.g., subscriber) can escalate their privileges to administrator or other higher-level roles by exploiting the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP request made when updating the user profile. By manipulating the `wpda_role[]` parameter, a malicious user can assign themselves unauthorized roles.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges. Additionally, the 'Enable role management' setting in the plugin must be enabled."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Versions up to, and including, 5.3.7 of the WP Data Access plugin are vulnerable.",
  "remediation": "Update to version 5.3.8 or a newer patched version of the plugin.",
    "cve": "CVE-2023-1874"
