Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a regression in the Spectre v2 mitigation for user-space applications on x86 CPUs that support IBRS but not eIBRS.
- When plain IBRS (not enhanced IBRS) is enabled, the kernel's logic incorrectly determines that STIBP (Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors) is not needed. This is because IBRS was assumed to implicitly protect against cross-thread branch target injection.
- However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit is cleared when returning to user space for performance reasons. This disables the implicit STIBP protection, leaving user space threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect logic in the kernel's `spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation()` function.
- Failure to recognize that IBRS is not sufficient to mitigate Spectre v2 attacks on user-space when the IBRS bit is cleared upon returning to userspace.
- Inadequate Spectre v2 mitigation for user-space applications on specific x86 CPUs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local or remote attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from a user-space application that was attempting to protect against Spectre v2. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data handled by the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur through cross-thread branch target injection.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by running malicious code on the same physical core as the victim process.
- Both local and remote attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the same physical core as the victim process that is attempting to utilize Spectre v2 mitigations.
- An understanding of how to perform cross-thread branch target injection is required.
- The attacker does not necessarily need elevated privileges to exploit the issue.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects CPUs that support IBRS but not eIBRS.
- The fix involves modifying the `spectre_v2_in_ibrs_mode()` check to allow STIBP to be enabled when legacy IBRS is enabled.
- The issue was discovered by Jos√© Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel version 6.3, with the fix commit being 6921ed9049bc7457f66c1596c5b78aec0dae4a9d
