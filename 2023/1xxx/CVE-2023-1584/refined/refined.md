Quarkus OIDC can leak both ID and access tokens in the authorization code flow when an insecure HTTP protocol is used, which can allow attackers to access sensitive user data directly from the ID token or by using the access token to access user data from OIDC provider services.

The vulnerability can also be mitigated by setting `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true` which stores the ID, access and refresh tokens in separate cookies, or by setting `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-refresh-tokens` if the access token is not used as a source of roles or to request `UserInfo`.",
