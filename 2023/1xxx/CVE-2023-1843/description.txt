The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized permalink structure update due to a missing capability check on the permalink_setup function in versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the permalink structure.
