Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-1147:

**Verification:**

The commit message "Fixes #186, possible XSS in comments" from the provided github content strongly suggests this commit addresses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is a common security issue. The change to `fp-includes/core/core.comment.php` further confirms this. Although the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided content aligns with a typical XSS vulnerability fix scenario.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises because user-supplied data within blog comments is not properly sanitized before being displayed. Specifically, the `comment_clean` function was not adequately removing HTML tags from the comment content, name, email and url fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization leading to an XSS vulnerability. Malicious users can inject JavaScript code into comment fields, which would then be executed by other users' browsers when viewing the comment.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** If successfully exploited, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Session hijacking:** The attacker can steal cookies or session tokens.
*   **Malware delivery:**  The attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:**  The attacker can modify the appearance of the page.
*   **Data theft:** Sensitive information displayed within the context of the website can potentially be stolen.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Comment fields:** The primary attack vector is the comment submission form, where an attacker enters malicious JavaScript code as part of the comment's name, email, url, or content fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to post comments:** An attacker needs to be able to post comments on the vulnerable blog or website. No other special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The commit modifies the `comment_clean` function in `fp-includes/core/core.comment.php`.

*   **Before the fix**: The `comment_clean` function applied `stripslashes` and `apply_filters`, but it did not remove HTML tags from the comment content, name, email and url fields which are later displayed to other users. This allowed potential javascript code injection.
*   **After the fix**: The code now applies `strip_tags` to the name, email, url and content fields after applying filters and stripslashes to remove HTML tags to prevent Javascript code execution in the user's browsers.
