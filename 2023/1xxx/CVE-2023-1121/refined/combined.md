## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Giveaways < 2.45.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Login with admin user and navigate to "Giveaways > Settings > Forms"
Enter XSS payload (<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>) in the Field Name and observe the popup. Click on save.
The XSS will be triggered each time an admin go to such settings and add a character to the field name
