- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browser of other users, which can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting the malicious script into the plugin's settings ("Giveaways > Settings > Forms", "Field Name" field).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with admin privileges to inject the malicious payload via the plugin's settings. The XSS payload will be triggered when an administrator visits the affected settings page.
