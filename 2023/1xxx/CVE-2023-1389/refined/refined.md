Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-1389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `/cgi-bin/luci;stok=/locale` endpoint of the TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) web management interface.
*   Specifically, the `country` parameter within the `write` operation is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core issue is that the `country` parameter is passed unsanitized to the `popen()` function. This function executes shell commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The lack of input validation on the `country` parameter allows for injection of shell metacharacters and commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router.
*   **Root Privileges:**  The injected commands are executed with root privileges, granting the attacker full control over the device.
*   **Botnet recruitment:** The vulnerability is being actively exploited by botnets like Mirai.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **`country` Parameter:** The malicious payload is embedded within the `country` parameter of the POST request.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **WAN Interface:** When combined with CVE-2023-27359, the vulnerability can be exploited via the WAN interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web management interface.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Vulnerable Device:** The target must be running a vulnerable firmware version of the TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) router.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially used as part of Tenable's Pwn2Own attempt.
*   The vendor, TP-Link, has released a fix in firmware version 1.1.4 Build 20230219, which removes the vulnerable callback.
*   The vulnerability is being exploited in the wild by botnets.
* The exploitation requires two requests. The first request sets the country parameter value and the second request executes the command injected via the parameter.

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameter, the method of exploitation and the requirement of a second request to trigger the vulnerability.
