{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control when creating personal access tokens (PATs). A Maintainer role user was able to create a PAT with owner privileges by directly submitting a request with the owner access level, bypassing the intended UI restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient access control when creating personal access tokens. The system didn't properly validate the user's role against the requested access level in the POST request to create a PAT.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user with Maintainer role could gain owner privileges for the project.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to create an access token, specifying the owner access level (50), even though the user did not have the rights to do so.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have Maintainer role within a project. They need to be able to craft and send an HTTP POST request."
