Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Weaver Xtreme Theme fails to properly sanitize the user's profile display name before displaying it on a webpage. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when a user views a page that includes the injected display name.
- **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The theme does not adequately escape the user-provided display name before rendering it in HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into pages.
- **User Compromise:** The injected scripts can perform a variety of malicious actions, including redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing session cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers might use scripts to modify the appearance or content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Profile Modification:** An attacker with the required privileges modifies their profile display name to include malicious JavaScript.
- **Page Access:**  Users accessing a page where the display name is rendered will trigger the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- **Privilege Level:** The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level permissions.
- **Web Access:**  The attacker must have web access to the WordPress backend to modify the profile.
