The content provided describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Friendly Island Pizza Website and Ordering System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `deleteorder.php` file. Specifically, the `id` GET parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- The provided examples demonstrate the ability to cause an SQL error and induce a time-based delay using the `sleep()` function. This could be used to perform more complex attacks like data exfiltration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the HTTP GET request to the `deleteorder.php` script, injecting malicious SQL commands within the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This typically implies the attacker needs to be on the same network or have access to the server over the internet. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges beyond being able to send HTTP requests.
