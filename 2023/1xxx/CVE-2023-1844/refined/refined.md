Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1844

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization check in the `send-email.php` file of the Subscribe2 plugin. Specifically, the plugin lacked a capability check when sending test emails, allowing users with lower privileges to send emails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper check to ensure that only users with the necessary permissions (specifically, `manage_options`) can send emails through the plugin's interface.
*   **Insecure capability check:** The plugin was using `publish_posts` capability check instead of `manage_options` for sending emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Email Sending:** An attacker with author-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability to send emails with arbitrary content and attachments to site users.
*   **Potential Phishing/Spam:** Attackers could use this to send phishing emails or spam under the guise of the website.
*   **Reputation Damage:** The website's reputation could be damaged if the emails are malicious.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin/send-email.php` endpoint when `s2_admin` parameter is set to `mail`.
*   This can be triggered from the WordPress admin panel if the attacker has author level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least author-level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker does not need any special technical skills to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was present in Subscribe2 plugin versions up to and including 10.40.
* The issue was fixed in version 10.41, which introduced proper capability checks and nonce verification.
* The fix also included using the built-in `sanitize_email()` function instead of a custom one.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on June 26, 2023.
