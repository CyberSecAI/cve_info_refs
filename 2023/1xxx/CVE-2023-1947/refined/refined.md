```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when adding columns in the management interface. Specifically, the `name` parameter in the POST request is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a cache file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Code Injection",
    "Unsanitized user input",
    "Remote code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. The attacker can gain a webshell to execute further commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with a specifically crafted `name` parameter while adding a column in the management interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the management interface, specifically the functionality to add columns, and must be able to make HTTP requests to the server."
