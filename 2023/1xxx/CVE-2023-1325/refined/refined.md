- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back into a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post which will execute when a user views the page. This allows for actions such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding malicious shortcodes into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least contributor access to WordPress. They need to be able to create or edit posts/pages and embed shortcodes.
