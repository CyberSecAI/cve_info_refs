- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data, specifically the `content` parameter, when creating or updating product details. This leads to the execution of malicious JavaScript code embedded in the stored data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `content` parameter in the `/api/admin/store/product/save` API endpoint is not validated or sanitized. The `v-html` directive in the frontend renders the stored content without proper escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they view the product details page, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/admin/store/product/save` endpoint, where the `content` parameter contains malicious JavaScript embedded within an HTML tag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to create or edit product details, which in this case, appears to be an admin user of the application.
