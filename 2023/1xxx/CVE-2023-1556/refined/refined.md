{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `main_event_id` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the provided payload which is used to leak the database name. The attacker could potentially modify or delete data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `main_event_id` parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication seems to be needed in this case."
