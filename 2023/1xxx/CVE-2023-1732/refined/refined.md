- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The implementation of Kyber and FrodoKEM did not check if `crypto/rand.Read()` returns an error when sampling randomness for a shared secret. Additionally, tkn20 and blindrsa components did not verify if enough randomness was returned from the user-provided randomness source.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper error handling when reading random data.
    - Insufficient randomness check in tkn20 and blindrsa components.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - In rare deployment cases, a predictable shared secret can be generated in Kyber and FrodoKEM if `crypto/rand.Read()` returns an error.
    -  Weak blinding for blindrsa.
    - Integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in tkn20.
- **Attack vectors**: Local (AV:L)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attack requires specific circumstances, and the attacker would need to exploit the error cases or a weak random source. User interaction is required (UI:R). It has a high attack complexity (AC:H).
