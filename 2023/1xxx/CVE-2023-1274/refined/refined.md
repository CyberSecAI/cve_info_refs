- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate shortcode attributes before using them to generate paths, which are then passed to include functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted shortcode attributes within a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to exploit the vulnerability.
