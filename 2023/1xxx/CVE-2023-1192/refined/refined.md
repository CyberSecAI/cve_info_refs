  "CVE-2023-1192": {
    "Metadata": {
      "description": "A use after free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS in the Linux Kernel. After CIFS transfers response data to system call, there is still a local variable points to the memory region, and if system call frees it faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS will access a free memory region leading to a denial of service.",
      "Link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1192"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Use-after-free in the `smb2_is_status_io_timeout()` function within the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation of the Linux kernel.",
       "Weaknesses": "After CIFS transfers response data to the system call, a local variable still points to the memory region. If the system call frees the memory faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS accesses a freed memory region.",
      "Impact": "A denial of service may be triggered if a local attacker can trigger a race condition that causes the CIFS client to use freed memory.",
      "Attack vector": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by causing a race condition where the system call frees memory before the CIFS component can use it.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Local attacker with normal user privilege.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the function `smb2_is_status_io_timeout()` is called from `cifs_demultiplex_thread()` after a response buffer may have been freed. If the error code is part of the encrypted payload, then the I/O timeout check should use the potentially new buffer. If it's not, the timeout check should be done before decryption."
