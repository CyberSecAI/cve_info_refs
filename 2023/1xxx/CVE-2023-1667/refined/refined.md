  "CVE-2023-1667": {
    "description": "libssh: NULL pointer dereference during rekeying with algorithm guessing",
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in libssh during rekeying with algorithm guessing. The issue occurs when the server attempts to process a rekeying request with the `first_kex_packet_follows` flag set in the KEXINIT message. Due to partial implementation of the guessing functionality, the server may dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper handling of rekeying with algorithm guessing"
     ],
    "impact": "An authenticated client can cause a denial of service (DoS) on the server by triggering the NULL pointer dereference. In threaded servers, this can lead to a DoS for other connections as well.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Remote"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid authentication credentials on the server"
    ],
     "details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a client initiates a rekeying process with algorithm guessing and sets the `first_kex_packet_follows` flag in the KEXINIT message. The server's partial implementation of the guessing functionality combined with improper state tracking can result in a NULL pointer dereference during the rekeying process. The server can crash due to this NULL dereference. Fork-based servers will only affect the single connection, while threaded servers are more prone to a DoS impacting other connections."
