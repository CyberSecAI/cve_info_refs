{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate HTTP requests, allowing for local file inclusion (LFI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to lack of validation on the `import_file_url` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, by manipulating the `import_file_url` parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a modified `import_file_url` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be an authenticated user with admin privileges."
