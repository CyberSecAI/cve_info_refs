Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wpfc_preload_single_callback` function within the WP Fastest Cache plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check within the `wpfc_preload_single_callback` function. This means that the function can be accessed by users who do not have the necessary permissions to perform cache creation, specifically the preload function.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference**: While not explicitly stated, the missing authorization check effectively allows for an insecure direct object reference where any user can trigger the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Cache Creation:** An attacker with subscriber-level access (or potentially lower) can trigger the cache creation process by invoking the vulnerable function `wpfc_preload_single_callback`.
*   **Resource Consumption:** Repeated unauthorized cache creation could potentially lead to increased resource consumption on the server hosting the WordPress site.
*   **Data Modification:** Although not a direct security impact, initiating cache creation modifies data (files) on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **Direct Function Call:** Attackers can exploit this by directly calling the `wpfc_preload_single_callback` function using `wp_ajax_wpfc_preload_single` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with a minimum of subscriber-level privileges (or possibly lower depending on the specific context)
*   **Network Access:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 of the WP Fastest Cache plugin.
*   Wordfence blocked 1,718 attacks targeting this vulnerability in the 24 hours before the report was written.
* The provided code diff shows the addition of nonce verification to several ajax callback functions including `wpfc_preload_single_callback` in changeset 2893158 which would mitigate the vulnerability.
