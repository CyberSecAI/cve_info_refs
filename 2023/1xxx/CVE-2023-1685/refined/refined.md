Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `HadSky v7.11.8` software.
- It is an **unauthenticated command execution vulnerability** due to a lack of proper input sanitization during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated Command Execution:**  The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server without requiring any authentication. This is made possible through a flaw in the installation process.
- **Configuration File Injection:** The attacker can insert a malicious payload, which is then written into the `config.php` file. This file is likely parsed by the application, which leads to the execution of injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable HadSky application.
- **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive data, install malware, or use the server as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Installation Interface:** The attack vector is through the installation interface of `HadSky v7.11.8`. The user provides input during installation and this input is not properly sanitized or validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the HadSky web server installation interface.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, as it occurs during the initial installation process.
