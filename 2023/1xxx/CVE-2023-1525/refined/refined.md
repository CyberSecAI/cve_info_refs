- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the `notification_message` setting in the `schema` tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the settings page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or a user with high privileges. They must navigate to the plugin's settings page, specifically the `schema` tab. Then they have to intercept the request and inject the XSS payload into the `site_reviews_v6[settings][general][notification_message]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level or similarly high privileges to access the plugin's settings page. They should also be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
