- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'currency_name' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with administrator privileges can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the 'currency_name' parameter in the Solidres plugin's administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges in the WordPress installation.
