- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Electron application `Markdown-Electron` has `nodeIntegration` enabled in its renderer process, which allows Node.js APIs to be used directly within the rendering context. The application also does not filter out dangerous operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unfiltered use of Node.js APIs in the renderer process.
    - Lack of sanitization of Markdown input.
    - Use of `nodeIntegration: true` in Electron.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the user's machine. An attacker could execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious Markdown file.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Opening a malicious Markdown file in the `Markdown-Electron` application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to create a malicious Markdown file.
    - Ability to trick the victim into opening the malicious Markdown file with the vulnerable application.
