Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The commit message "fix: corrected wrong check on user permission" indicates that the vulnerability was caused by an incorrect check on user permissions in the `phpmyfaq/admin/record.add.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Permission Check:** The original code allowed users with either 'edit\_faq' or 'add\_faq' permissions to add a new FAQ record. The fix changes this to only allow users with 'add\_faq' permission. This suggests that the original code was overly permissive, allowing users with editing permissions to potentially add records when they shouldn't have been able to. This indicates a vulnerability where users could bypass access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The incorrect permission check allowed users with `edit_faq` permissions to potentially add new records.
- This could lead to unauthorized data modification, potentially allowing attackers to create malicious FAQ entries or disrupt the system's content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically the `record.add.php` file.
- An attacker would need to have an account with the `edit_faq` permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be a logged-in user with `edit_faq` permission to add FAQ records bypassing the intended access control.
