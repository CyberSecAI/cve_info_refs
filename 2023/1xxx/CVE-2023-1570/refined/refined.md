The provided content relates to CVE-2023-1570, specifically detailing a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `tinydng` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in `stbi__getn` function when loading a crafted TGA image, due to an issue in the `memcpy` operation. This is triggered when `stbi__tga_load` is called, during DNG image loading.
- The vulnerability exists within the `stb_image.h` header file, which is used by `tinydng` to handle image loading. Specifically, the `memcpy` operation in `stbi__getn` attempts to read beyond the bounds of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application abort/crash)

**Attack vectors:**
- By loading a specially crafted DNG file (which contains a malformed TGA image) using the `tinydng` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted DNG file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of `tinydng` library.

**Additional details:**
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) report provided in the issue comments clearly shows a heap-buffer-overflow with the following information:
    - The overflow occurs at address `0x619000000430` with a read size of `6927` bytes.
    - The crash happens within `__interceptor_memcpy` function, specifically when called from `stbi__getn`.
    - The call stack pinpoints the vulnerability's origin from `stbi__tga_load`, which is used during the DNG loading process.
    - The allocation size of the buffer was 944 bytes while memcpy attempts to write 6927 bytes.

- There are two separate, but related, issues reported: #28 and #29. Issue #29 is described as "same thing" as issue #28 and was fixed by fixing issue #28.
