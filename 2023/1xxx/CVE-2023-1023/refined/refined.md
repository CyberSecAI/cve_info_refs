{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check on the `saveSitemapSettings` function, which allows authenticated users with subscriber-level access to modify sitemap settings. The plugin incorrectly relied on nonce checks for access control, which are accessible to all authenticated users regardless of their role.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Authorization",
      "Incorrect Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with subscriber-level access could change sitemap-related settings of the plugin. This could lead to reduced visibility of content in search engine results or other malicious modifications to the sitemap.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least subscriber level) to exploit the vulnerability."
