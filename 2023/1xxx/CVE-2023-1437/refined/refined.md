- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of untrusted pointers within the Advantech WebAccess/SCADA software. Specifically, the RPC arguments sent by the client can include raw memory pointers that the server uses without proper validation. This lack of validation allows for malicious exploitation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an "Untrusted Pointer Dereference" (CWE-822), where the server directly uses memory pointers provided by the client without verifying their validity. This allows manipulation of memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation enables an attacker to gain access to the remote file system, execute arbitrary commands, and overwrite files. This leads to potential data breaches, system compromise, and disruption of industrial processes controlled by the SCADA software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, as the vulnerability is exploitable over a network connection. The attacker sends crafted RPC arguments with malicious memory pointers to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess/SCADA server. No authentication is required (PR:N). The attack has low complexity (AC:L) and does not require user interaction (UI:N).
