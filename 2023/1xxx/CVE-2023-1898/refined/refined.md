The content is related to CVE-2023-1898.

**Root Cause:**
The Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 web server uses a small amount of session ID numbers, making it possible for an attacker to guess a valid session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain access to data of an active user's session by guessing or iterating through valid session ID numbers.
- Successful exploitation could lead to a takeover of a user’s active session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker could try to enter a valid session ID number to access an active user’s session data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 web server.
- No special privileges are required.
- Low attack complexity.
