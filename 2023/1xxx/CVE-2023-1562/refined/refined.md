The provided content is a security update page from Mattermost's website. It lists security updates for their products, but it does not contain any information about a specific vulnerability identified by CVE-2023-1562. The page structure suggests that the list of vulnerabilities would appear within the table with columns "Issue ID", "Severity", "Affected Versions", "Release Date", "Fix Versions", and "Details". However, no actual entries exist in the table.

Therefore, based on the content, I would respond:
NOINFO
