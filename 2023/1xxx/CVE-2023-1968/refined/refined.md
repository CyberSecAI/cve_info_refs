The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-1968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from the Universal Copy Service (UCS) binding to an unrestricted IP address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address (CWE-1327):** The UCS listens on all IP addresses, including those capable of accepting remote communications, without proper authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can use the UCS to listen on all IP addresses, including those capable of accepting remote communications.
*   A successful exploit could enable an attacker to take any action at the operating system level, impacting settings, configurations, software, or data on the affected product.
*   The attacker could interact with the affected product via a connected network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (remote).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be on the network or have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Illumina Universal Copy Service v2.x.
*   Affected products include various Illumina instruments and software versions.
*   The advisory also references CVE-2023-1966, which involves "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges" in UCS v1.x and v2.x, allowing for remote code execution at the OS level.
*   Illumina recommends using the UCS Vulnerability Instructions Guide to mitigate these vulnerabilities, including software updates and configuring UCS account credentials.
*   CISA recommends minimizing network exposure for control system devices, locating control system networks behind firewalls, and using secure methods such as VPNs for remote access when needed.
