New firmware for Atom R9 Cat4 Gen2 CPEs has been released. Starting with this release, the naming convention for Cat4 CPEs is changing from “BaiCE AP” to “BaiCE BM”. This is mainly due to adding support for new hardware (Qualcomm Cat4 modem).

Highlight features for this release are:

* WiFi alignment
* Tunnel mode (for upcoming HaloB L2)
* STUN (for quicker SAS registration)
* L2TPv3 Support

![:warning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=12 ":warning:") **NOTICE:** Starting with version BaiCE BM 2.5, SAS will automatically be enabled when the CPE connects to a Band 48 cell. Registration with the SAS is required before regular data traffic is allowed on the WAN interface. Only exception to this is when using the EUD firmware which restricts max EIRP to 23dBm.

**SUPPORTED HARDWARE:**

* Atom OD04H *(EG7035E)*
* Atom OD04L *(EG7035L)*
* Atom ID04 *(EG2030C)*

**Software Download:** [BaiCE\_BM\_2.5.26](https://na.baicells.com/download/BaiCE_BM_2.5.26_NA.bin)

**Module Firmware:**

* MLHxxxx: [4.2.2.0-40957\_BYPASS\_V1.0.7](https://na.baicells.com/download/4.2.2.0-40957_BYPASS_V1.0.7.tgz)
* MT421e: [3.3.2.0-TDD-32803-BYPASS-1.0.2-Standard-20200304](https://na.baicells.com/download/3.3.2.0-TDD-32803-BYPASS-1.0.2-Standard-20200304.tgz)

Hello,

I tried this new version on some of my CPEs.

It works well for those with MLHxxxx module, but those with MT421e module don’t reconnect to my acs (genieacs). I ran a tcpdump capture on my epc, they don’t try to contact the acs at all. They also don’t try to resolve the acs dns name.

They all seem to be configured the same way.

Any idea ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
