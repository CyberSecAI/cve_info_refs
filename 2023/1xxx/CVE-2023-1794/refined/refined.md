The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter in `/ghpolice/admin/casedetails.php` before including it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, allowing them to:
  - Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
  - Steal cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Deface the page.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `id` parameter.
- The victim is lured into visiting the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim user to visit the malicious URL, usually through social engineering, phishing or other means.
