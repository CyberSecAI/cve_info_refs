- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly verify if the bookings to be updated belong to the user making the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin uses the `idUser` parameter to identify which user's booking is being modified, but this parameter can be manipulated by any authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can book, add notes, or cancel bookings on behalf of other users, potentially leading to disruption of service, unauthorized access to sensitive booking information, or manipulation of bookings.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the plugin's booking update functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site and needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests. They also need to be able to modify the `idUser` parameter within the intercepted request. Since the `idUser` is an incremental numerical value it can be brute-forced.
