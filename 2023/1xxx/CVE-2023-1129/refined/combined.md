## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP FEvents Book <= 0.46 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Booking Manipulation via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not ensures that bookings to be updated belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated user to book, add notes, or cancel booking on behalf of other users.

### Proof of Concept

1. Book (or cancel booking) an event using an authenticated user.
2. Intercept the request using an HTTP Proxy (e.g., BurpSuite).
3. Change the `idUser` parameter in the request, and forward it.
Note: Since the `idUser` value is an incremental numerical value, it is easily brute forced.
