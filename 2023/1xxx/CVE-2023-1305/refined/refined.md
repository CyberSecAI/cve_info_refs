      "Exposed object with file writing capabilities.",
       "Lack of proper input sanitization.",
      "Insufficient access control on resources."

    "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite leading to potential system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious Jinja template within the email body.",
        "The attacker sends the crafted template to the Jinja rendering API endpoint."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create and edit bots within InsightCloudSec. The attacker also needs to be able to send requests to the Jinja rendering API endpoint, which could involve the ability to create or edit email templates within the application."
