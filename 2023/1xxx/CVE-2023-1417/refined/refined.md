It is also possible to add child epics to private groups, and although the attacker would have to guess or know the epic id and while no confidential information is leaked initially, a victim may still navigate to the attacker's epic and leak information that way."

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authorization when creating child epics via the REST API. An attacker can specify a `parent_id` of an epic belonging to a group they do not have access to, causing the attacker's epic to be linked as a child of the victim's epic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Authorization: The system fails to verify if the user creating a child epic has the required permissions on the target epic specified by the `parent_id`.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The attacker can obtain the victim's epic ID (global ID) through public/internal visibility or from previous access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create an attacker-controlled epic that appears as a child of a victim's epic in a separate group.
- Victims might be tricked into navigating to attacker-controlled content or trusting the attacker's group, potentially leading to further attacks.
- Although no confidential information is directly leaked, the relationship between the attacker-controlled epic and the victim's epic can be misleading and potentially harmful to the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically through REST API interaction.
- Exploiting the ability to create multi-level epics.
- Modifying the POST request to `/api/v4/groups/attackerepicgroup/epics` via tools like Burp Suite to include a `parent_id` for the target's epic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs an account on the GitLab instance.
- Attacker needs an Ultimate license to create multi-level epics.
- Attacker must have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- Attacker needs to know the victim's epic ID (which can be obtained if the victim's group is public/internal or through previous access).
