The provided content is related to CVE-2023-1701.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper encoding of user-provided data, specifically within the delete confirmation dialogs for predefined metadata and properties in the Pimcore application. The `name` property of the data being deleted is not properly escaped before being displayed in the confirmation dialog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript into the `name` field of a predefined property or metadata, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of another user's browser. This is due to the use of `data.data.name` directly in the confirmation message without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the application
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim
- The severity depends on the specific actions an attacker can achieve within the application, based on the privileges of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could create or modify a predefined property or metadata entry and inject malicious code into the `name` field.
- When an administrator tries to delete the crafted entry, the malicious code would be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to create/modify predefined metadata and properties within the Pimcore application.
- No special network position is needed, the attacker only needs to interact with the Pimcore application.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves using `Ext.util.Format.htmlEncode()` to escape the `name` data before it's displayed in the delete confirmation dialog.
- The vulnerability is present in both `metadata/predefined.js` and `properties/predefined.js` files.
