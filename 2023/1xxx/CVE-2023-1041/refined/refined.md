The content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Simple Responsive Tourism Website v1.0" by oretnom23.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` GET parameter within the `rate_review.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks. The provided examples show how an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, including displaying an alert box (`alert(1111)`) or accessing the victim's cookies (`alert(document.cookie)`).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `id` GET parameter of the `/tourism/rate_review.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. This can be achieved through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
