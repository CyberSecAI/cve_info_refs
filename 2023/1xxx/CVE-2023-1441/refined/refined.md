The provided content is related to a SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'id' GET parameter before using it in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to potentially retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or in some cases, execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The provided examples demonstrate the ability to read data using `UNION SELECT` injection and perform blind injection using a `sleep` command.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the `/aqpg/admin/courses/view_course.php` endpoint, with a malicious payload injected into the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific capabilities or specific privileges are necessary, as the vulnerability can be triggered through normal HTTP requests.
