Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user. Specifically, the `oid` parameter in the `/pet_shop/admin/orders/update_status.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or encode the `oid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user within the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal cookies and potentially hijack the user's session (as shown in `Payload2`).
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data that the user has access to.
*  **Malicious Redirection:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.
*  **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL, embedding the JavaScript payload in the `oid` parameter and sends it to the victim, typically via a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with the malicious payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL, or get them to visit the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/pet_shop/admin/orders/update_status.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `oid` (GET request)
*   **Payload 1:** `oid=1"><script>alert(1111)</script>`
*   **Payload 2:** `oid=1"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
* The provided examples show how the vulnerability can be exploited using GET requests and javascript injection.
