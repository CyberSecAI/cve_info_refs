Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by commit `86f9693dc64ed54220ed6c10e13e824ca4f6aacf`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an XSS vulnerability related to files uploaded through drafts. The vulnerability arises because the application was not correctly verifying the mime type of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to potentially upload malicious files that could execute arbitrary code when viewed by a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient MIME Type Validation:** The code was not robustly validating the MIME type of uploaded files. It primarily relied on the `type` attribute of the file upload, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.
*  **Lack of File Content Validation:** The code did not verify if the content of the file matched the declared MIME type and  only performed a basic check to see if the file's type starts with `image/`. It also failed to check for file content validity, thus not preventing a malicious file disguised as an image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., an HTML file with embedded JavaScript) disguised as a legitimate file type. When a user views or downloads this malicious file through the application, the embedded script could execute within the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload via Drafts:** The attack vector involves uploading files through the draft functionality of the application. This implies that the vulnerability is triggered when handling files uploaded while creating or editing drafts.
*   **MIME Type Spoofing:** An attacker can manipulate the declared MIME type of a malicious file during upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files through the application's draft feature.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker would need to be aware of how to manipulate MIME types during file uploads to disguise malicious files.

**Mitigation:**
The commit addresses the issue by implementing the following changes:
*   `include/ajax.draft.php`: Includes additional file validation checks by using `FileUploadField::isValidFile()` to ensure files are valid images.
*   `include/class.file.php`: Implements `mime_type` function that uses `finfo_open` and `finfo_file` to detect the mime type of the uploaded file based on it's content, which is harder to spoof. If `finfo_open` is not available, then it falls back to `mime_content_type`.
*   `include/class.forms.php`: Added a call to `FileObject::mime_type` and compare it with the mime type sent by the client to validate the file by checking if the two match.

This commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by adding more robust file validation checks to prevent the upload of malicious files.
