Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `1de3ec27e50ba7389c9449c59e8ea3a37a908ee4`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the user password reset functionality. Specifically, the original implementation of the `RetrievePassWord` function in `internal/service/user_service.go` returned an error indicating whether a user with the provided email exists or not. This allowed an attacker to probe the system to find out valid email addresses of registered users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **User Enumeration:** The vulnerability is a form of user enumeration. By attempting password reset with different email addresses, an attacker can determine which email addresses are registered in the system, thereby identifying valid users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can gather a list of valid email addresses for the target system. This can aid in subsequent attacks, such as targeted phishing or brute-force attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker could send password reset requests with different email addresses to the `/users/password-reset` endpoint of the system. The response will indicate whether the email is registered by the specific error returned.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the system's password reset endpoint.
*   No special privileges are needed, anyone can make the requests.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

The commit `1de3ec27e50ba7389c9449c59e8ea3a37a908ee4` fixes the vulnerability by modifying the `RetrievePassWord` function:

1.  **Error Handling:** Instead of returning an error directly if the user doesn't exist or there's any issue, the function now returns a generic `nil` error if a user is not found.
2.  **Return Value:** The return type of the `RetrievePassWord` function is changed from `(string, error)` to `error`, ensuring that the function does not return the error which might disclose information about the user's existence.

These changes ensure that the system does not reveal the existence or non-existence of a user based on the password reset request outcome.
