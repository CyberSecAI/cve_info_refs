Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1922

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `wpfc_pause_cdn_integration_ajax_request_callback` function within the WP Fastest Cache plugin. This lack of proper validation allows unauthorized requests to be processed by the vulnerable function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to CSRF attacks due to the missing nonce validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify CDN settings of the website by forging a request that calls the vulnerable function. This could lead to various issues, including:
    - Disrupting CDN functionality.
    - Potentially redirecting traffic.
    - Causing denial of service (if CDN is misconfigured).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a forged HTTP request sent to the vulnerable endpoint `wpfc_pause_cdn_integration_ajax_request_callback`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website which executes the forged request. This requires some level of social engineering.
- The attacker doesn't need to have any privileges on the target site except being able to send an HTTP request to the target site.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects WP Fastest Cache versions up to and including 1.1.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 with the addition of nonce verification.
- The provided patch details (Changeset 2893158) shows the addition of nonce verification on multiple ajax action callbacks.
