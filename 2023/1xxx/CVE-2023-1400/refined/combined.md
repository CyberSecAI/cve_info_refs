## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Modern Events Calendar lite < 6.5.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the import/export section.
2. Enter the following payload in the input fields of Google API key and Calendar ID: "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
