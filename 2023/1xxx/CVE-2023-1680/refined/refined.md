Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insecure file access control in the CMS, leading to information disclosure by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The identified files (`/dayrui/My/View/main.html`, `/config/myfield/test.php`, `/dayrui/My/Config/Install.txt`, and `/dayrui/Fcms/View/system_log.html`) are publicly accessible without proper authentication or authorization checks. This exposes potentially sensitive information.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The system lacks sufficient access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to view the content of these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The leaked files may contain configuration details, potentially exposing database credentials, internal system paths, and other sensitive information. This could allow an attacker to gain deeper access or compromise the system.
- **Code and Configuration Exposure:** Direct access to source code (.php files) and configuration files like Install.txt allows attackers to understand internal logic, identify other potential vulnerabilities, and gather information that may aid in further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable files using their respective URLs (e.g., `/dayrui/My/View/main.html`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the web server where the CMS is hosted. No prior authentication or special permissions are necessary to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.

**Summary of Vulnerable Files:**
- `/dayrui/My/View/main.html`: Likely contains UI elements or system configuration details.
- `/config/myfield/test.php`:  May contain test code or configuration related to custom fields. The exposure of a .php file could also potentially lead to code execution vulnerabilities if exploited further.
- `/dayrui/My/Config/Install.txt`: Likely contains installation instructions or configuration information, which could contain sensitive details.
- `/dayrui/Fcms/View/system_log.html`: May contain system logs that could reveal information about system activity or potential security flaws.
