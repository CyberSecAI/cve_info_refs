## About this release

OpenShift Container Platform ([RHSA-2022:7399](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A7399)) is now available. This release uses [Kubernetes 1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 are included in this topic.

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 clusters are available at <https://console.redhat.com/openshift>. With the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for OpenShift Container Platform, you can deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and a later version of RHEL 8 that is released before End of Life of OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines.

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 an additional six months of Extended Update Support (EUS) phase on even numbered releases from 18 months to two years. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).

OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in [OpenShift Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases) and [OpenShift EUS Overview](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus).

Maintenance support ends for version 4.8 in January 2023 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).

## OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of OpenShift Container Platform changes independently of the OpenShift Container Platform version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).

## New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

#### Default consoles for new clusters are now determined by the installation platform

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes installed from an OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 boot image now use a platform-specific default console. The default consoles on cloud platforms correspond to the specific system consoles expected by that cloud provider. VMware and OpenStack images now use a primary graphical console and a secondary serial console. Other bare metal installations now use only the graphical console by default, and do not enable a serial console. Installations performed with `coreos-installer` can override existing defaults and enable the serial console.

Existing nodes are not affected. New nodes on existing clusters are not likely to be affected because they are typically installed from the boot image that was originally used to install the cluster.

For information about how to enable the serial console, see the following documentation:

* [Default console configuration](../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-console-configuration_installing-bare-metal).
* [Modifying a live install ISO image to enable the serial console](../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-iso-serial-console_installing-bare-metal).
* [Modifying a live install PXE environment to enable the serial console](../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-pxe-serial-console_installing-bare-metal).

#### IBM Secure Execution on IBM Z and LinuxONE (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform now supports configuring Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes for IBM Secure Execution on IBM Z and LinuxONE (s390x architecture) as a Technology Preview feature. IBM Secure Execution is a hardware enhancement that protects memory boundaries for KVM guests. IBM Secure Execution provides the highest level of isolation and security for cluster workloads, and you can enable it by using an IBM Secure Execution-ready QCOW2 boot image.

To use IBM Secure Execution, you must have host keys for your host machine(s) and they must be specified in your Ignition configuration file. IBM Secure Execution automatically encrypts your boot volumes using LUKS encryption.

For more information, see [Installing RHCOS using IBM Secure Execution](../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z-kvm.html#installing-rhcos-using-ibm-secure-execution_installing-ibm-z-kvm).

#### RHCOS now uses RHEL 8.6

RHCOS now uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 packages in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates. OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release that will continue to use RHEL 8.4 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

### Installation and upgrade

#### Assisted Installer SaaS provides platform integration support for Nutanix

Assisted Installer SaaS on [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com) supports installation of OpenShift Container Platform on the Nutanix platform with Machine API integration using either the Assisted Installer user interface or the REST API. Integration enables Nutanix Prism users to manage their infrastructure from a single interface, and enables auto-scaling. There are a few additional installation steps to enable Nutanix integration with Assisted Installer SaaS. See the Assisted Installer documentation for details.

#### Specify the load balancer type in AWS during installation

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can specify either Network Load Balancer (NLB) or Classic as a persistent load balancer type in AWS during installation. Afterwards, if an Ingress Controller is deleted, the load balancer type persists with the lbType configured during installation.

For more information, see [Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations](../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.html).

#### Extend worker nodes to the edge of AWS when installing into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Local Zone subnets.

With this update you can install OpenShift Container Platform to an existing VPC with installer-provisioned infrastructure, extending the worker nodes to Local Zones subnets. The installation program will provision worker nodes on the edge of the AWS network that are specifically designated for user applications by using NoSchedule taints. Applications deployed on the Local Zones locations deliver low latency for end users.

For more information, see [Installing a cluster using AWS Local Zones](../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.html).

#### Google Cloud Platform Marketplace offering

OpenShift Container Platform is now available on the GCP Marketplace. Installing an OpenShift Container Platform with a GCP Marketplace image lets you create self-managed cluster deployments that are billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through GCP, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

For more information about installing using installer-provisioned infrastructure, see [Using a GCP Marketplace image](../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html#installation-gcp-marketplace_installing-gcp-customizations). For more information about installing a using user-provisioned infrastructure, see [Creating additional worker machines in GCP](../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra.html#installation-creating-gcp-worker_installing-gcp-user-infra).

#### Troubleshooting bootstrap failures during installation on GCP and Azure

The installer now gathers serial console logs from the bootstrap and control plane hosts on GCP and Azure. This log data is added to the standard bootstrap log bundle.

For more information, see [Troubleshooting installation issues](../installing/validation_and_troubleshooting/installing-troubleshooting.html#installation-bootstrap-gather_installing-troubleshooting).

#### IBM Cloud VPC general availability

IBM Cloud VPC is now generally available in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.

For more information about installing a cluster, see [Preparing to install on IBM Cloud VPC](../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.html#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud).

#### Required administrator acknowledgment when upgrading from OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 to 4.12

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 uses Kubernetes 1.25, which removed [several deprecated APIs](../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis).

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 to 4.12. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be upgraded to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.

For more information, see [Preparing to update to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12](../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.html#updating-cluster-prepare).

#### Enabling a feature set when installing a cluster

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can enable a feature set as part of the installation process. A feature set is a collection of OpenShift Container Platform features that are not enabled by default.

For more information about enabling a feature set during installation, see [Enabling OpenShift Container Platform features using feature gates](../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.html#nodes-cluster-enabling).

#### OpenShift Container Platform on ARM

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is now supported on ARM architecture-based Azure installer-provisioned infrastructure. AWS Graviton 3 processors are now available for cluster deployments and are also supported on OpenShift Container Platform 4.11. For more information about instance availability and installation documentation, see [Supported installation methods for different platforms](../installing/overview/installing-preparing.html#supported-installation-methods-for-different-platforms)

#### Mirroring file-based catalog Operator images in OCI format with the oc-mirror CLI plugin (Technology Preview)

Using the oc-mirror CLI plugin to mirror file-based catalog Operator images in OCI format instead of Docker v2 format is now available as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview).

For more information, see [Mirroring file-based catalog Operator images in OCI format](../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.html#oc-mirror-oci-format_installing-mirroring-disconnected).

#### Installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on GCP into a shared VPC (Technology Preview)

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can install a cluster on GCP into a shared VPC as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview). In this installation method, the cluster is configured to use a VPC from a different GCP project. A shared VPC enables an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network. You can communicate within the organization securely and efficiently by using internal IP addresses from that network.

For more information, see [Installing a cluster on GCP into a shared VPC](../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-shared-vpc.html#installing-gcp-shared-vpc).

#### Consistent IP address for Ironic API in bare-metal installations without a provisioning network

With this update, in bare-metal installations without a provisioning network, the Ironic API service is accessible through a proxy server. This proxy server provides a consistent IP address for the Ironic API service. If the Metal3 pod that contains `metal3-ironic` relocates to another pod, the consistent proxy address ensures constant communication with the Ironic API service.

#### Installing OpenShift Container Platform on GCP using service account authentication

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can install a cluster on GCP using a virtual machine with a service account attached to it. This allows you to perform an installation without needing to use a service account JSON file.

For more information, see [Creating a GCP service account](../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.html#installation-gcp-service-account_installing-gcp-account).

#### `propagateUserTags` parameter for AWS resources provisioned by the OpenShift Container Platform cluster

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the `propagateUserTags` parameter is a flag that directs in-cluster Operators to include the specified user tags in the tags of the AWS resources that the Operators create.

For more information, see [Optional configuration parameters](../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-aws-network-customizations).

#### Ironic container images use RHEL 9 base image

In earlier versions of OpenShift Container Platform, Ironic container images used Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 as the base image. From OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, Ironic container images use RHEL 9 as the base image. The RHEL 9 base image adds support for CentOS Stream 9, Python 3.8, and Python 3.9 in Ironic components.

For more information about the Ironic provisioning service, see [Deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal](../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.html).

#### Cloud provider configuration updates for clusters that run on RHOSP

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) are switched from the legacy OpenStack cloud provider to the external Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). This change follows the move in Kubernetes from in-tree, legacy cloud providers to external cloud providers that are implemented by using the [Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/).

For more information, see [The OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager](../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-cloud-config-reference.html#nw-openstack-external-ccm_installing-openstack-cloud-config-reference).

#### Support for workloads on RHOSP distributed compute nodes

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, cluster deployments to Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) clouds that have distributed compute node (DCN) architecture were validated. A reference architecture for these deployments is forthcoming.

For a brief overview of this type of deployment, see the blog post [Deploying Your Cluster atÂ the Edge With OpenStack](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/deploying-your-cluster-at-the-edge-with-openstack).

#### OpenShift Container Platform on AWS Outposts (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is now supported on the AWS Outposts platform as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview). With AWS Outposts you can deploy edge-based worker nodes, while using AWS Regions for the control plane nodes. For more information, see [Installing a cluster on AWS with remote workers on AWS Outposts](../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-outposts-remote-workers.html).

#### Agent-based installation supports two input modes

The Agent-based installation supports two input modes:

* `install-config.yaml` file
* `agent-config.yaml` file

Optional

* Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) manifests

With the preferred mode, you can configure the `install-config.yaml` file and specify Agent-based specific settings in the `agent-config.yaml` file.
For more information, see [About the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#about-the-agent-based-installer).

#### Agent-based installation supports installing OpenShift Container Platform clusters in FIPS compliant mode

Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer supports OpenShift Container Platform clusters in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant mode. You must set the value of the `fips` field to `True` in the `install-config.yaml` file.
For more information, see [About FIPS compliance](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#agent-installer-configuring-fips-compliance_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer).

#### Deploy an Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a disconnected environment

You can perform an Agent-based installation in a disconnected environment. To create an image that is used in a disconnected environment, the `imageContentSources` section in the `install-config.yaml` file must contain the mirror information or `registries.conf` file if you are using ZTP manifests. The actual configuration settings to use in these files are supplied by either the `oc adm release mirror` or `oc mirror` command.
For more information, see [Understanding disconnected installation mirroring](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/understanding-disconnected-installation-mirroring.html#understanding-disconnected-installation-mirroring).

#### Explanation of field to build and push graph-data

When creating the image set configuration, you can add the `graph: true` field to build and push the graph-data image to the mirror registry. The graph-data image is required to create OpenShift Update Service (OSUS). The `graph: true` field also generates the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest. The `oc` command-line interface (CLI) can use the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest to create OSUS.

#### Agent-based installation supports single and dual stack networking

You can create the agent ISO image with the following IP address configurations:

* IPv4
* IPv6
* IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel (dual-stack)

|  | IPv6 is supported only on bare metal platforms. |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Dual and single IP stack clusters](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/installing-with-agent-based-installer.html#installing-ocp-agent_installing-with-agent-based-installer).

#### Agent deployed OpenShift Container Platform cluster can be used as a hub cluster

You can install the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator and deploy a hub cluster with the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer.
For more information, see [Preparing an Agent-based installed cluster for the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-an-agent-based-installed-cluster-for-mce.html#preparing-an-agent-based-installed-cluster-for-mce).

#### Agent-based installation performs installation validations

The Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer performs validations on:

* Installation image generation: The user-provided manifests are checked for validity and compatibility.
* Installation: The installation service checks the hardware available for installation and emits validation events that can be retrieved with the `openshift-install agent wait-for` subcommands.

For more information, see [Installation validations](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#validations-before-agent-iso-creation_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer).

#### Configure static networking in a Agent-based installation

With the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer, you can configure static IP addresses for IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6) for all the hosts prior to creating the agent ISO image. You can add the static addresses to the `hosts` section of the `agent-config.yaml` file or in the `NMStateConfig.yaml` file if you are using the ZTP manifests.
Note that the configuration of the addresses must follow the syntax rules for NMState as described in [NMState state examples](https://nmstate.io/examples.html).

|  | IPv6 is supported only on bare metal platforms. |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [About networking](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#agent-install-networking_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer).

#### CLI based automated deployment in an Agent-based installation

With the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer, you can define your installation configurations, generate an ISO for all the nodes, and then have an unattended installation by booting the target systems with the generated ISO.
For more information, see [Installing a OpenShift Container Platform cluster with the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/installing-with-agent-based-installer.html#installing-with-agent-based-installer).

#### Agent-based installation supports host specific configuration at the instalation time

You can configure the hostname, network configuration in NMState format, root device hints, and role in an Agent-based installation.

For more information, see [About root device hints](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#root-device-hints_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer).

#### Agent-based installation supports DHCP

With the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer, you can deploy to environments where you rely on DHCP to configure networking for all the nodes, as long as you know the IP that at least one of the systems will receive. This IP is required so that all nodes use it as a meeting point.
For more information, see [DHCP](../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#dhcp).

#### Installing a cluster on Nutanix with limited internet access

You can now install a cluster on Nutanix when the environment has limited access to to the internet, as in the case of a disconnected or restricted network cluster. With this type of installation, you create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift Container Platform image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network.

For more information, see [About disconnected installation mirroring](../installing/disconnected_install/index.html#installing-mirroring-disconnected-about) and [Installing a cluster on Nutanix in a restricted network](../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-restricted-networks-nutanix-installer-provisioned.html#installing-restricted-networks-nutanix-installer-provisioned).

### Post-installation configuration

#### CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters

To install a CSI driver on a cluster running on vSphere, the following requirements must be met:

* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* VMware vSphere version 7.0 Update 2 or later, which includes version 8.0.
* vCenter 7.0 Update 2 or later, which includes version 8.0.
* No third-party CSI driver already installed in the cluster

  If a third-party CSI driver is present in the cluster, OpenShift Container Platform does not overwrite it.

Components with versions earlier than those above are still supported, but are deprecated. These versions are still fully supported, but version 4.12 of OpenShift Container Platform requires vSphere virtual hardware version 15 or later. For more information, see [Deprecated and removed features](../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html#ocp-4-12-deprecated-removed-features).

Failing to meet the above requirements prevents OpenShift Container Platform from upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or later.

#### Cluster Capabilities

The following new cluster capabilities have been added:

* Console
* Insights
* Storage
* CSISnapshot

A new predefined set of cluster capabilities, `v4.12`, has been added. This includes all capabilities from `v4.11`, and the new capabilities added with the current release.

For more information, see link: [Enabling cluster capabilities](../post_installation_configuration/enabling-cluster-capabilities.html).

#### OpenShift Container Platform with multi-architecture compute machines (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 with multi-architecture compute machines now supports manifest listed images on image streams. For more information about manifest list images, see [Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster](../post_installation_configuration/multi-architecture-configuration.html).

On a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you can now override the node affinity in the Operatorâs `Subscription` object to schedule pods on nodes with architectures that the Operator supports. For more information, see [Using node affinity to control where an Operator is installed](../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.html#olm-overriding-operator-pod-affinity_nodes-scheduler-node-affinity).

### Web console

#### Administrator Perspective

With this release, there are several updates to the **Administrator** perspective of the web console.

* The OpenShift Container Platform web console displays a `ConsoleNotification` if the cluster is upgrading. Once the upgrade is done, the notification is removed.
* A ***restart rollout*** option for the `Deployment` resource and a ***retry rollouts*** option for the `DeploymentConfig` resource are available on the **Action** and **Kebab** menus.

##### Multi-architecture compute machines on the OpenShift Container Platform web console

The `console-operator` now scans all nodes and builds a set of all architecture types that cluster nodes run on and pass it to the `console-config.yaml`. The `console-operator` can be installed on nodes with architectures of the values `amd64`, `arm64`, `ppc64le`, or `s390x`.

For more information about multi-architechture compute machines, see [Configuring a multi-architecture compute machine on an OpenShift cluster](../post_installation_configuration/multi-architecture-configuration.html).

##### Dynamic plugin generally available

This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and is now generally available in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12. With the dynamic plugin, you can build high quality and unique user experiences natively in the web console. You can:

* Add custom pages.
* Add perspectives beyond administrator and developer.
* Add navigation items.
* Add tabs and actions to resource pages.
* Extend existing pages.

For more information, see [Overview of dynamic-plugins](../web_console/dynamic-plugin/overview-dynamic-plugin.html#overview-of-dynamic-plugins).

#### Developer Perspective

  + Use the standard icons to zoom in, zoom out, fit to screen, and reset the view.
  + **PipelineRun details** page only: At specific zoom factors, the background color of the tasks changes to indicate the error or warning status. You can hover over the tasks badge to see the total number of tasks and the completed tasks.

##### Helm page improvements

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can do the following from the **Helm** page:

* Create Helm releases and repositories using the **Create** button.
* Create, update, or delete a cluster-scoped or a namespace-scoped Helm chart repository.
* View the list of the existing Helm chart repositories with their scope in the **Repositories** page.
* View the newly created Helm release in the **Helm Releases** page.

##### Negative matchers in Alertmanager

With this update, Alertmanager now supports a `Negative matcher` option. Using `Negative matcher`, you can update the **Label value** to a Not Equals matcher. The negative matcher checkbox changes `=` (value equals) into `!=` (value does not equal) and changes `=~` (value matches regular expression) into `!~`(value does not match regular expression). Also, the **Use RegEx** checkbox label is renamed to **RegEx**.

For more information, see [Security Profiles Operator Overview](../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-overview.html).

### Networking

#### Support for dual-stack addressing for the API VIP and Ingress VIP

Assisted Installer supports installation of OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later versions with dual stack networking for the API VIP and Ingress VIP on bare metal only. This support introduces two new configuration settings: `api_vips` and `ingress_vips`, which can take a list of IP addresses. The legacy settings, `api_vip` and `ingress_vip` must also be set in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12; however, since they only take one IP address, you must set the IPv4 address when configuring dual stack networking for the API VIP and Ingress VIP with the legacy `api_vip` and `ingress_vip` configuration settings.

The API VIP address and the Ingress VIP address must be of the primary IP address family when using dual-stack networking. Currently, Red Hat does not support dual-stack VIPs or dual-stack networking with IPv6 as the primary IP address family. However, Red Hat does support dual-stack networking with IPv4 as the primary IP address family. Therefore, you must place the IPv4 entries before the IPv6 entries. See the Assisted Installer documentation for details.

#### Red Hat OpenShift Networking

Red Hat OpenShift Networking is an ecosystem of features, plugins, and advanced networking capabilities that extend Kubernetes networking beyond the Kubernetes CNI plugin with the advanced networking-related features that your cluster needs to manage its network traffic for one or multiple hybrid clusters. This ecosystem of networking capabilities integrates ingress, egress, load balancing, high-performance throughput, security, and inter-, and intra-cluster traffic management and provides role-based observability tooling to reduce its natural complexities.

For more information, see [About networking](../networking/about-networking.html#about-networking).

#### OVN-Kubernetes is now the default networking plugin

When installing a new cluster the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is the default networking plugin. For all prior versions of OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift SDN remains the default networking plugin.

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin includes a wider array of features than OpenShift SDN, including:

* Support for all existing OpenShift SDN features
* Support for [IPv6 networks](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/converting-to-dual-stack.html#converting-to-dual-stack)
* Support for [Configuring IPsec encryption](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-ipsec-ovn.html#configuring-ipsec-ovn)
* Complete support for the [`NetworkPolicy` API](../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html#about-network-policy)
* Support for [audit logging of network policy events](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/logging-network-policy.html#logging-network-policy)
* Support for [network flow tracking](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/tracking-network-flows.html#tracking-network-flows) in NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX formats
* Support for [hybrid networks](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.html#configuring-hybrid-networking) for Windows containers
* Support for [hardware offloading](../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-hardware-offloading.html#configuring-hardware-offloading) to compatible NICs

There are also enormous scale, performance, and stability improvements in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 compared to prior versions.

If you are using the OpenShift SDN network plugin, note that:

* Existing and future deployments using OpenShift SDN continues to be supported.
* OpenShift SDN remains the default on OpenShift Container Platform versions earlier than 4.12.
* As of OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, OpenShift SDN is a supported installation-time option.
* OpenShift SDN remains feature frozen.

For more information about OVN-Kubernetes, including a feature comparison matrix with OpenShift SDN, see [About the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.html#about-ovn-kubernetes).

For information on migrating to OVN-Kubernetes from OpenShift SDN, see [Migrating from the OpenShift SDN network plugin](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.html#migrate-from-openshift-sdn).

#### Ingress Node Firewall Operator

This update introduces a new stateless Ingress Node Firewall Operator. You can now configure firewall rules at the node level. For more information, see [Ingress Node Firewall Operator](../networking/networking-operators-overview.html#networking-operators-overview).

#### Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:

* `ovn_controller_southbound_database_connected`
* `ovnkube_master_libovsdb_monitors`
* `ovnkube_master_network_programming_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_network_programming_ovn_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_egress_routing_via_host`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_resets_total`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_rx_dropped_total`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_tx_dropped_total`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_rx_errors_total`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_tx_errors_total`
* `ovs_vswitchd_interface_collisions_total`

The following metric has been removed:

* `ovnkube_master_skipped_nbctl_daemon_total`

#### Multi-zone Installer Provisioned Infrastructure VMware vSphere installation (Technology Preview)

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12,
the ability to configure multiple vCenter datacenters and multiple vCenter clusters in a single vCenter installation using installer-provisioned infrastructure is now available as a Technology Preview feature. Using vCenter tags, you can use this feature to associate vCenter datacenters and compute clusters with openshift-regions and openshift-zones. These associations define failure domains to enable application workloads to be associated with specific locations and failure domains.

#### Kubernetes NMState in VMware vSphere now supported

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can configure the networking settings such as DNS servers or search domains, VLANs, bridges, and interface bonding using the Kubernetes NMState Operator on your VMware vSphere instance.

For more information, see [About the Kubernetes NMState Operator](../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.html).

#### Kubernetes NMState in OpenStack now supported

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can configure the networking settings such as DNS servers or search domains, VLANs, bridges, and interface bonding using the Kubernetes NMState Operator on your OpenStack instance.

For more information, see [About the Kubernetes NMState Operator](../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.html).

#### External DNS Operator

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the External DNS Operator modifies the format of the ExternalDNS wildcard TXT records on AzureDNS. The External DNS Operator replaces the asterisk with `any` in ExternalDNS wildcard TXT records. You must avoid the ExternalDNS wildcard A and CNAME records having `any` leftmost subdomain because this might cause a conflict.

The upstream version of `ExternalDNS` for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is v0.13.1.

#### Capturing metrics and telemetry associated with the use of routes and shards

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the Cluster Ingress Operator exports a new metric named `route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard`. The `shard_name` label of the metric specifies the name of the shards. This metric gives the total number of routes that are admitted by each shard.

The following metrics are sent through telemetry.

Table 1. Metrics sent through telemetry

| Name | Recording rule expression | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:min` | `min(route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)` | Tracks the minimum number of routes admitted by any of the shards |
| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:max` | `max(route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)` | Tracks the maximum number of routes admitted by any of the shards |
| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:avg` | `avg(route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)` | Tracks the average value of the `route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard` metric |
| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:median` | `quantile(0.5, route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)` | Tracks the median value of the `route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard` metric |
| `cluster:openshift_route_info:tls_termination:sum` | `sum (openshift_route_info) by (tls_termination)` | Tracks the number of routes for each `tls_termination` value. The possible values for `tls_termination` are `edge`, `passthrough` and `reencrypt` |

#### AWS Load Balancer Operator

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the AWS Load Balancer controller now implements the Kubernetes Ingress specification for multiple matches. If multiple paths within an Ingress match a request, the longest matching path takes the precedence. If two paths still match, paths with an exact path type take precedence over a prefix path type.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator sets the `EnableIPTargetType` feature gate to `false`. The AWS Load Balancer controller disables the support for services and ingress resources for `target-type` `ip`.

The upstream version of `aws-load-balancer-controller` for an OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is v2.4.4.

#### Ingress Controller Autoscaling (Technology Preview)

You can now use the OpenShift Container Platform Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to dynamically scale the default Ingress Controller based on metrics in your deployed cluster, such as the number of worker nodes available. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see [Autoscaling an Ingress Controller](../networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-autoscaling-ingress-controller_configuring-ingress).

#### HAProxy maxConnections default is now 50,000

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the default value for the `maxConnections` setting is now 50000. Previously starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, the default value for the `maxConnections` setting was 20000.

For more information, see [Ingress Controller configuration parameters](../networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress).

#### Configuration of an Ingress Controller for manual DNS management

You can now configure an Ingress Controller to stop automatic DNS management and start manual DNS management. Set the `dnsManagementPolicy` parameter to specify automatic or manual DNS management.

For more information, see [Configuring an Ingress Controller to manually manage DNS](../networking/ingress-controller-dnsmgt.html#ingress-controller-dnsmgt).

#### Supported hardware for SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 adds support for the following SR-IOV devices:

* Intel X710 Base T
* MT2892 Family [ConnectXâ6Â Dx]
* MT2894 Family [ConnectX-6 Lx]
* MT42822 BlueFieldâ2 in ConnectXâ6 NIC mode
* Silicom STS Family

For more information, see [Supported devices](../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov).

#### Supported hardware for OvS (Open vSwitch) Hardware Offload

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 adds OvS Hardware Offload support for the following devices:

* MT2892 Family [ConnectX-6 Dx]
* MT2894 Family [ConnectX-6 Lx]
* MT42822 BlueFieldâ2 in ConnectXâ6 NIC mode

For more information, see [Supported devices](../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-hardware-offloading.html#supported_devices_configuring-hardware-offloading).

#### Multi-network-policy supported for SR-IOV (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 adds support for configuring multi-network policy for SR-IOV devices.

You can now configure multi-network for SR-IOV additional networks. Configuring SR-IOV additional networks is a Technology Preview feature and is only supported with kernel network interface cards (NICs).

For more information, see [Configuring multi-network policy](../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-multi-network-policy.html#configuring-multi-network-policy).

#### Switch between AWS load balancer types without deleting the Ingress Controller

You can update the Ingress Controller to switch between an AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB) and an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) without deleting the Ingress Controller.

For more information, see [Configuring ingress cluster traffic on AWS](../networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-aws.html).

#### IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol now default on the SR-IOV CNI plugin

Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new podâs MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information.

For more information, see [Supported devices](../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov).

#### Support for CoreDNS cache tuning

You can now configure the time-to-live (TTL) duration of both successful and unsuccessful DNS queries cached by CoreDNS.

For more information, see [Tuning the CoreDNS cache](../networking/dns-operator.html#nw-dns-cache-tuning_dns-operator).

#### OVN-Kubernetes supports configuration of internal subnet

Previously, the subnet that OVN-Kubernetes uses internally was `100.64.0.0/16` for IPv4 and `fd98::/48` for IPv6 and could not be modified. To support instances when these subnets overlap with existing subnets in your infrastructure, you can now change these internal subnets to avoid any overlap.

For more information, see [Cluster Network Operator configuration object](../networking/cluster-network-operator.html#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_cluster-network-operator)

#### Egress IP support on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)

RHOSP, paired with OpenShift Container Platform, now supports automatic attachment and detachment of Egress IP addresses. The traffic from one or more pods in any number of namespaces has a consistent source IP address for services outside of the cluster. This support applies to OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes as default network providers.

#### OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes feature migration support

If you plan to migrate from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, your configurations for the following capabilities are automatically converted to work with OVN-Kubernetes:

* Egress IP addresses
* Egress firewalls
* Multicast

For more information about how the migration to OVN-Kubernetes works, see [Migrating from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.html#migrate-from-openshift-sdn).

#### Egress firewall audit logging

For the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, egress firewalls support audit logging using the same mechanism that network policy audit logging uses. For more information, see [Logging for egress firewall and network policy rules](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/logging-network-policy.html#logging-network-policy).

#### Advertise MetalLB from a given address pool from a subset of nodes

With this update, in BGP mode, you can use the node selector to advertise the MetalLB service from a subset of nodes, using a specific pool of IP addresses. This feature was introduced as a Technology Preview feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 and is now generally available in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 for BGP mode only. L2 mode remains a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see [Advertising an IP address pool from a subset of nodes](../networking/metallb/about-advertising-ipaddresspool.html#nw-metallb-advertise-ip-pools-to-node-subset_about-advertising-ip-address-pool).

#### Additional deployment specifications for MetalLB

This update provides additional deployment specifications for MetalLB. When you use a custom resource to deploy MetalLB, you can use these additional deployment specifications to manage how MetalLB `speaker` and `controller` pods deploy and run in your cluster. For example, you can use MetalLB deployment specifications to manage where MetalLB pods are deployed, define CPU limits for MetalLB pods, and assign runtime classes to MetalLB pods.

For more information about deployment specifications for MetalLB, see [Deployment specifications for MetalLB](../networking/metallb/metallb-operator-install.html#nw-metallb-operator-deployment-specifications-for-metallb_metallb-operator-install).

#### Node IP selection improvements

Previously, the `nodeip-configuration` service on a cluster host selected the IP address from the interface that the default route used. If multiple routes were present, the service would select the route with the lowest metric value. As a result, network traffic could be distributed from the incorrect interface.

With OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, a new interface has been added to the `nodeip-configuration` service, which allows users to create a hint file. The hint file contains a variable, `NODEIP_HINT`, that overrides the default IP selection logic and selects a specific node IP address from the subnet `NODEIP_HINT` variable. Using the `NODEIP_HINT` variable allows users to specify which IP address is used, ensuring that network traffic is distributed from the correct interface.

For more information, see [Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic](../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-network-issues.html#overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic_troubleshooting-network-issues).

#### CoreDNS update to version 1.10.0

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, CoreDNS uses version 1.10.0, which includes the following changes:

* CoreDNS does not expand the query UDP buffer size if it was previously set to a smaller value.
* CoreDNS now always prefixes each log line in Kubernetes client logs with the associated log level.
* CoreDNS now reloads more quickly at an approximate speed of 20ms.

#### Support for a configurable reload interval in HAProxy

With this update, a cluster administrator can configure the reload interval to force HAProxy to reload its configuration less frequently in response to route and endpoint updates. The default minimum HAProxy reload interval is 5 seconds.

For more information, see [Configuring HAProxy reload interval](../scalability_and_performance/optimization/routing-optimization.html#configuring-haproxy-interval_routing-optimization).

#### Network Observability Operator updates

The Network Observability Operator releases updates independently from the OpenShift Container Platform minor version release stream. Updates are available through a single, rolling stream which is supported on all currently supported versions of OpenShift Container Platform 4. Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the Network Observability Operator can be found in the [Network Observability release notes](../observability/network_observability/network-observability-operator-release-notes.html).

#### IPv6 for secondary network interfaces on RHOSP

IPv6 for secondary network interfaces is now supported in clusters that run on RHOSP.

For more information,see [Enabling IPv6 connectivity to pods on RHOSP](../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-network-config.html#nw-osp-pod-connections-ipv6_installing-openstack-network-config).

#### UDP support for load balancers on RHOSP

Resulting from the switch to an external OpenStack cloud provider, UDP is now supported for `LoadBalancer` services for clusters that run on that platform.

#### Deploy the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

If you configured and deployed your hosting service cluster, you can now deploy the SR-IOV Operator for a hosted cluster. For more information, see [Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes](../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-operator.html#sriov-operator-hosted-control-planes_configuring-sriov-operator).

#### Support for IPv6 virtual IP (VIP) addresses for the Ingress VIP and API VIP services on bare metal

With this update, in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the `ingressVIP` and `apiVIP` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file are deprecated. Instead, use the `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings. These settings support dual-stack networking for applications on bare metal that require IPv4 and IPv6 access to the cluster by using the Ingress VIP and API VIP services. The `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings use a list format to specify an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or both IP address formats. The order of the list indicates the primary and secondary VIP address for each service. The primary IP address must be from the IPv4 network when using dual stack networking.

#### Support for switching the Bluefield-2 network device from data processing unit (DPU) mode to network interface controller (NIC) mode (Technology Preview)

With this update, you can switch the BlueField-2 network device from data processing unit (DPU) mode to network interface controller (NIC) mode.

For more information, see [Switching Bluefield-2 from DPU to NIC](../networking/hardware_networks/switching-bf2-nic-dpu.html#switching-bf2-nic-dpu).

#### Support for enabling hybrid networking after cluster installation

Previously, for clusters that use the [OVN-Kubernetes network plugin](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.html#about-ovn-kubernetes), during cluster installation you could enable hybrid networking so that your cluster supported Windows nodes. Now you can enable hybrid networking after installation. For more information, see [Configuring hybrid networking](../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.html#configuring-hybrid-networking).

#### Support for allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts in the Network API service object

The `ServiceSpec` component in the Network API under the `Service` object describes the attributes that a user creates on a service. The `allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts` attribute within the `ServiceSpec` component is now supported as of OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.28 release. The `allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts` attribute defines whether the `NodePorts` will be automatically allocated for services of the `LoadBalancer` type.

For more information, see [Network API ServiceSpec object](../rest_api/network_apis/service-v1.html#spec)

### Storage

#### Persistent storage using the GCP Filestore Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore. The GCP Filestore CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview.

For more information, see see [GCP Filestore CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file.html).

#### Automatic CSI migration for AWS Elastic Block Storage auto migration is generally available

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, automatic migration for in-tree volume plugins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers became available as a Technology Preview feature. Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Storage (EBS) was provided in this feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, and OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 now supports automatic migration for AWS EBS as generally available. CSI migration for AWS EBS is now enabled by default and requires no action by an administrator.

This feature automatically translates in-tree objects to their counterpart CSI representations and should be completely transparent to users. Translated objects are not stored on disk, and user data is not migrated.

While storage class referencing to the in-tree storage plugin will continue working, it is recommended that you switch the default storage class to the CSI storage class.

For more information, see [CSI Automatic Migration](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.html).

#### Automatic CSI migration for GCP PD auto migration is generally available

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, automatic migration for in-tree volume plugins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers became available as a Technology Preview feature. Support for Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk (GCP PD) was provided in this feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, and OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 now supports automatic migration for GCP PD as generally available. CSI migration for GCP PD is now enabled by default and requires no action by an administrator.

This feature automatically translates in-tree objects to their counterpart CSI representations and should be completely transparent to users. Translated objects are not stored on disk, and user data is not migrated.

While storage class referencing to the in-tree storage plugin will continue working, it is recommended that you switch the default storage class to the CSI storage class.

For more information, see [CSI Automatic Migration](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.html).

#### Updating from OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 to 4.13 and later with vSphere in-tree PVs

Updates from OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 to 4.13 and from 4.13 to 4.14 are blocked if **all** of the following conditions are true:

* CSI migration is not already enabled
* OpenShift Container Platform is not running on vSphere 7.0u3L+ or 8.0u2+
* vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) are present

For more information, see [CSI Automatic Migration](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.html).

#### Storage capacity tracking for pod scheduling is generally available

This new feature exposes the currently available storage capacity using `CSIStorageCapacity` objects, and enhances scheduling of pods that use Container Storage Interface (CSI) volumes with late binding. Currently, the only OpenShift Container Platform storage type that supports this features is OpenShift Data Foundation.

#### VMware vSphere CSI topology is generally available

OpenShift Container Platform provides the ability to deploy OpenShift Container Platform for vSphere on different zones and regions, which allows you to deploy over multiple compute clusters, thus helping to avoid a single point of failure.

For more information, see [vSphere CSI topology](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.html#persistent-storage-csi-vsphere-top-aware_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere).

#### Local ephemeral storage resource management is generally available

The local ephemeral storage resource management features is now generally available. With this feature, you can manage local ephemeral storage by specifying requests and limits.

For more information, see [Ephemeral storage management](../storage/understanding-ephemeral-storage.html#storage-ephemeral-storage-manage_understanding-ephemeral-storage).

#### Volume populators (Technology Preview)

Volume populators use `datasource` to enable creating pre-populated volumes.

Volume population is currently enabled, and supported as a Technology Preview feature. However, OpenShift Container Platform does not ship with any volume populators.

For more information, see [Volume populators](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.html#persistent-storage-csi-vol-populator_persistent-storage-csi).

#### VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements

For OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, VMWare vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator requires the following minimum components installed:

* VMware vSphere version 7.0 Update 2 or later, which includes version 8.0.
* vCenter 7.0 Update 2 or later, which includes version 8.0.
* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* No third-party CSI driver already installed in the cluster

If a third-party CSI driver is present in the cluster, OpenShift Container Platform does not overwrite it. The presence of a third-party CSI driver prevents OpenShift Container Platform from upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or later.

For more information, see [VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.html#vsphere-csi-driver-reqs_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere).

#### Azure File supporting NFS is generally available

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 supports Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator with Network File System (NFS) as generally available.

For more information, see [NFS support](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-azure-file.html#persistent-storage-csi-azure-file-nfs_persistent-storage-csi-azure-file).

### Operator lifecycle

#### Platform Operators (Technology Preview)

Starting in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) introduces the *platform Operator* type as a Technology Preview feature. The platform Operator mechanism relies on resources from the RukPak component, also introduced in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, to source and manage content.

A platform Operator is an OLM-based Operator that can be installed during or after an OpenShift Container Platform clusterâs Day 0 operations and participates in the clusterâs lifecycle. As a cluster administrator, you can use platform Operators to further customize your OpenShift Container Platform installation to meet your requirements and use cases.

For more information about platform Operators, see [Managing platform Operators](../operators/admin/olm-managing-po.html#olm-managing-po). For more information about RukPak and its resources, see [Operator Framework packaging format](../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.html#olm-rukpak-about_olm-packaging-format).

#### Controlling where an Operator is installed

By default, when you install an Operator, OpenShift Container Platform randomly installs the Operator pod to one of your worker nodes.

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can control where an Operator pod is installed by adding affinity constraints to the Operatorâs `Subscription` object.

For more information, see [Controlling where an Operator is installed](../operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html#olm-overriding-operator-pod-affinity_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster).

#### Pod security admission synchronization for user-created openshift-\* namespaces

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, pod security admission synchronization is enabled by default if an Operator is installed in user-created namespaces that have an `openshift-` prefix. Synchronization is enabled after a cluster service version (CSV) is created in the namespace. The synchronized label inherits the permissions of the service accounts in the namespace.

For more information, see [Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards](../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.html#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission).

### Operator development

#### Configuring the security context of a catalog pod

You can configure the security context of a catalog pod by using the `--security-context-config` flag on the `run bundle` and `bundle-upgrade` subcommands. The flag enables seccomp profiles to comply with pod security admission. The flag accepts the values of `restricted` and `legacy`. If you do not specify a value, the seccomp profile defaults to `restricted`. If your catalog pod cannot run with restricted permissions, set the flag to `legacy`, as shown in the following example:

```
$ operator-sdk run bundle \
  --security-context-config=legacy
```

#### Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25

You can now check bundle manifests for deprecated APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25 by using the Operator Framework suite of tests with the `bundle validate` subcommand.

For example:

```
$ operator-sdk bundle validate .<bundle_dir_or_image> \
  --select-optional suite=operatorframework \
  --optional-values=k8s-version=1.25
```

If your Operator requests permission to use any of the APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25, the command displays a warning message.

If any of the API versions removed from Kubernetes 1.25 are included in your Operatorâs cluster service version (CSV), the command displays an error message.

See [Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25](../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis) and the [Operator SDK CLI reference](../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-cli-ref.html#osdk-cli-ref-bundle-validate) for more information.

### Machine API

#### Control plane machine sets

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 introduces control plane machine sets. Control plane machine sets provide management capabilities for control plane machines that are similar to what compute machine sets provide for compute machines. For more information, see [Managing control plane machines](../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-about.html#cpmso-about).

#### Specifying cluster autoscaler log level verbosity

OpenShift Container Platform now supports setting the log level verbosity of the cluster autoscaler by setting the `logVerbosity` parameter in the `ClusterAutoscaler` custom resource. For more information, see the [`ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition](../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.html#cluster-autoscaler-cr_applying-autoscaling).

#### Enabling Azure boot diagnostics

OpenShift Container Platform now supports enabling boot diagnostics on Azure machines that your machine set creates. For more information, see "Enabling Azure boot diagnostics" for [compute machines](../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-azure.html#machineset-azure-boot-diagnostics_creating-machineset-azure) or [control plane machines](../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-using.html#machineset-azure-boot-diagnostics_cpmso-using).

### Machine Config Operator

#### RHCOS image layering

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image layering allows you to add new images on top of the base RHCOS image. This layering does not modify the base RHCOS image. Instead, it creates a *custom layered image* that includes all RHCOS functionality and adds additional functionality to specific nodes in the cluster.

Currently, RHCOS image layering allows you to work with Customer Experience and Engagement (CEE) to obtain and apply Hotfix packages on top of your RHCOS image, based on the [Red Hat Hotfix policy](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2996001). It is planned for future releases that you can use RHCOS image layering to incorporate third-party software packages such as Libreswan or numactl.

For more information, see [RHCOS image layering](../post_installation_configuration/coreos-layering.html#coreos-layering).

### Nodes

#### Updating the interface-specific safe list (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform now supports updating the default interface-specific safe `sysctls`.

You can add or remove `sysctls` from the predefined list.
When you add `sysctls`, they can be set across all nodes.
Updating the interface-specific safe `sysctls` list is a Technology Preview feature only.

For more information, see [Updating the interface-specific safe sysctls list](../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-sysctls.html#updating-interface-specific-safe-sysctls-list_nodes-containers-using).

#### Cron job time zones (Technology Preview)

Setting a time zone for a cron job schedule is now offered as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview). If a time zone is not specified, the Kubernetes controller manager interprets the schedule relative to its local time zone.

For more information, see [Creating cron jobs](../nodes/jobs/nodes-nodes-jobs.html#nodes-nodes-jobs-creating-cron_nodes-nodes-jobs).

#### Linux Control Group version 2 promoted to Technology Preview

OpenShift Container Platform support for [Linux Control Group version 2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) (cgroup v2) has been promoted to Technology Preview. cgroup v2 is the next version of the kernel [control groups](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01). cgroups v2 offers multiple improvements, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as [Pressure Stall Information](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html), and enhanced resource management and isolation. For more information, see [Enabling Linux Control Group version 2 (cgroup v2)](../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.html#nodes-cluster-cgroups-2).

#### crun container runtime (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform now supports the crun container runtime in Technology Preview. You can switch between the crun container runtime and the default container runtime as needed by using a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resource (CR). For more information, see [About the container engine and container runtime](../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-using.html#nodes-containers-runtimes).

#### Self Node Remediation Operator enhancements

OpenShift Container Platform now supports control plane fencing by the Self Node Remediation Operator. In the event of node failure, you can follow remediation strategies on both worker nodes and control plane nodes. For more information, see the [Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/23.2/html-single/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/index#about-remediation-fencing-maintenance-snr) documentation.

#### Node Health Check Operator enhancements

OpenShift Container Platform now supports control plane fencing on the Node Health Check Operator. In the event of node failure, you can follow remediation strategies on both worker nodes and control plane nodes. For more information, see the [Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/23.2/html-single/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/index#self-node-remediation-operator-remediate-nodes) documentation.

The Node Health Check Operator now also includes a web console plugin for managing Node Health Checks. For more information, see the [Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/23.2/html-single/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/index#about-remediation-fencing-maintenance-nhc) documentation.

For installing or updating to the latest version of the Node Health Check Operator, use the `stable` subscription channel. For more information, see the [Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/23.2/html-single/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/index#installing-self-node-remediation-operator-using-cli_self-node-remediation-operator-remediate-nodes) documentation.

### Monitoring

The monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features.

#### Updates to monitoring stack components and dependencies

This release includes the following version updates for monitoring stack components and dependencies:

* kube-state-metrics to 2.6.0
* node-exporter to 1.4.0
* prom-label-proxy to 0.5.0
* Prometheus to 2.39.1
* prometheus-adapter to 0.10.0
* prometheus-operator to 0.60.1
* Thanos to 0.28.1

#### Changes to alerting rules

|  | Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules. |
| --- | --- |

* **New**

  + Added the `TelemeterClientFailures` alert, which triggers when a cluster tries and fails to submit Telemetry data at a certain rate over a period of time. The alert fires when the rate of failed requests reaches 20% of the total rate of requests within a 15-minute window.
* **Changed**

  + The `KubeAggregatedAPIDown` alert now waits 900 seconds rather than 300 seconds before sending a notification.
  + The `NodeClockNotSynchronising` and `NodeClockSkewDetected` alerts now only evaluate metrics from the `node-exporter` job.
  + The `NodeRAIDDegraded` and `NodeRAIDDiskFailure` alerts now include a device label filter to match only the value returned by `mmcblk.p.|nvme.|sd.|vd.|xvd.|dm-.|dasd.+`.
  + The `PrometheusHighQueryLoad` and `ThanosQueryOverload` alerts now also trigger when a high querying load exists on the query layer.

#### New option to specify pod topology spread constraints for monitoring components

You can now use pod topology spread constraints to control how Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Alertmanager pods are spread across a network topology when OpenShift Container Platform pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

#### New option to improve data consistency for Prometheus Adapter

You can now configure an optional kubelet service monitor for Prometheus Adapter (PA) that improves data consistency across multiple autoscaling requests.
Enabling this service monitor eliminates the possibility that two queries sent at the same time to PA might yield different results because the underlying PromQL queries executed by PA might be on different Prometheus servers.

#### Update to Alertmanager configuration for additional secret keys

With this release, if you configure an Alertmanager secret to hold additional keys and if the Alertmanager configuration references these keys as files (such as templates, TLS certificates, or tokens), your configuration settings must point to these keys by using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
These keys are available under the `/etc/alertmanager/config` directory.
In earlier releases of OpenShift Container Platform, you could use relative paths in your configuration to point to these keys because the Alertmanager configuration file was located in the same directory as the keys.

|  | If you are upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and have specified relative paths for additional Alertmanager secret keys that are referenced as files, you must change these relative paths to absolute paths in your Alertmanager configuration. Otherwise, alert receivers that use the files will fail to deliver notifications. |
| --- | --- |

### New Network Observability Operator

As an administrator, you can now install the Network Observability Operator to observe the network traffic for OpenShift Container Platform cluster in the console. You can view and monitor the network traffic data in different graphical representations. The Network Observability Operator uses eBPF technology to create the network flows. The network flows are enriched with OpenShift Container Platform information, and stored in Loki. You can use the network traffic information for detailed troubleshooting and analysis.

For more information, see [Network Observability](../observability/network_observability/network-observability-overview.html#network-observability-overview).

### Scalability and performance

#### Disabling realtime using workload hints removes Receive Packet Steering from the cluster

At the cluster level by default, a systemd service sets a Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask for virtual network interfaces. The RPS mask routes interrupt requests from virtual network interfaces according to the list of reserved CPUs defined in the performance profile. At the container level, a `CRI-O` hook script also sets an RPS mask for all virtual network devices.

With this update, if you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` in the performance profile to `False`, the system also disables both the systemd service and the `CRI-O` hook script which set the RPS mask. The system disables these RPS functions because RPS is typically relevant to use cases requiring low-latency, realtime workloads only.

To retain RPS functions even when you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` to `False`, see the *RPS Settings* section of the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution [Performance addons operator advanced configuration](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5532341).

For more information about configuring workload hints, see [Understanding workload hints](../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html#cnf-understanding-workload-hints_cnf-master).

#### Tuned profile

The `tuned` profile now defines the `fs.aio-max-nr` `sysctl` value by default, improving asynchronous I/O performance for default node profiles.

#### Support for new kernel features and options

The low latency tuning has been updated to use the latest kernel features and options. The fix for [2117780](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117780) introduced a new per-CPU `kthread`, `ktimers`. This thread must be pinned to the proper CPU cores. With this update, there is no functional change; the isolation of the workload is the same. For more information, see [2102450](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102450).

#### Power-saving configurations

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, by enabling C-states and OS-controlled P-states, you can use different power-saving configurations for critical and non-critical workloads. You can apply the configurations through the new `perPodPowerManagement` workload hint, and the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` and `cpu-freq-governor.crio.io` CRI-O annotations. For more information about the feature, see [Power-saving configurations](../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html#node-tuning-operator-pod-power-saving-config_cnf-master).

#### Expanding Single-node OpenShift clusters with worker nodes using GitOps ZTP (Technology Preview)

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, a feature allowing you to manually add worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters was introduced. This feature is now also available in GitOps ZTP.

For more information, see [Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters with GitOps ZTP](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-sno-additional-worker-node.html#ztp-additional-worker-sno_sno-additional-worker).

#### Factory-precaching-cli tool to reduce OpenShift Container Platform and Operator deployment times (Technology Preview)

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can use the factory-precaching-cli tool to pre-cache OpenShift Container Platform and Operator images on a server at the factory, and then you can include the pre-cached server to the site for deployment. For more information about the factory-precaching-cli tool, see [Pre-caching images for single-node OpenShift deployments](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-precaching-tool.html).

#### Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) integration of the factory-precaching-cli tool (Technology Preview)

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, you can use the factory-precaching-cli tool in the GitOps ZTP workflow. For more information, see [Pre-caching images for single-node OpenShift deployments](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-precaching-tool.html).

#### Node tuning in a hosted cluster (Technology Preview)

You can now configure OS-level tuning for nodes in a hosted cluster by using the Node Tuning Operator. To configure node tuning, you can create config maps in the management cluster that contain `Tuned` objects, and reference those config maps in your node pools. The tuning configuration that is definied in the `Tuned` objects is applied to the nodes in the node pool. For more information, see [Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster](../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.html#node-tuning-hosted-cluster_node-tuning-operator).

#### Kernel module management Operator

The kernel module management (KMM) Operator replaces the Special Resource Operator (SRO).
KMM includes the following features for connected environments only:

* Hub and spoke support for edge deployments
* Pre-flight checks for upgrade support
* Secure boot kernel module signing
* Must gather logs to assist with troubleshooting
* Binary firmware deployment

#### Hub and spoke cluster support (Technology Preview)

For hub and spoke deployments in an environment that can access the internet, you can use the kernel module management (KMM) Operator deployed in the hub cluster to manage the deployment of the required kernel modules to one or more managed clusters.

#### Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM)

Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) now provides more detailed status information and messages, and redesigned conditions.
You can use the `ClusterLabelSelector` field for greater flexibility in selecting clusters for update.
You can use timeout settings to determine what happens if an update fails for a cluster, for example, skipping the failing cluster and continuing to upgrade other clusters, or stopping policy remediation for all clusters.
For more information see [Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager for cluster updates](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.html).

#### Mount namespace encapsulation (Technology Preview)

Encapsulation is the process of moving all Kubernetes-specific mount points to an alternative namespace to reduce the visibility and performance impact of a large number of mount points in the default namespace. Previously, mount namespace encapsulation has been deployed transparently in OpenShift Container Platform specifically for Distributed Units (DUs) installed using GitOps ZTP. In OpenShift Container Platform v4.12, this functionality is now available as a configurable option.

A standard host operating system uses systemd to constantly scan all mount namespaces: both the standard Linux mounts and the numerous mounts that Kubernetes uses to operate. The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level namespace for all container and Kubelet mount points. Encapsulating these container-specific mount points in a private namespace reduces systemd overhead and enhances CPU performance. Encapsulation can also improve security, by storing Kubernetes-specific mount points in a location safe from inspection by unprivileged users.

For more information, see [Optimizing CPU usage with mount namespace encapsulation](../scalability_and_performance/optimization/optimizing-cpu-usage.html#optimizing-cpu-usage).

#### Changing the workload partitioning CPU set in single-node OpenShift clusters that are deployed with GitOps ZTP

You can configure the workload partitioning CPU set in single-node OpenShift clusters that you deploy with GitOps ZTP.
To do this, you specify cluster management CPU resources with the `cpuset` field of the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and the `reserved` field of the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
The value that you set for `cpuset` should match the value set in the cluster `PerformanceProfile` CR `.spec.cpu.reserved` field for workload partitioning.

For more information, see [Workload partitioning](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.html#ztp-sno-du-enabling-workload-partitioning_sno-configure-for-vdu).

#### RHACM hub template functions now available for use with GitOps ZTP

Hub template functions are now available for use with GitOps ZTP using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM).
Hub-side cluster templates reduce the need to create separate policies for many clusters with similiar configurations but with different values.
For more information, see [Using hub templates in PolicyGenTemplate CRs](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-policy-config.html#ztp-using-hub-cluster-templates_ztp-advanced-policy-config).

#### ArgoCD managed cluster limits

RHACM uses `SiteConfig` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 300 `SiteConfig` CRs.
For more information, see [Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster.html#ztp-configuring-hub-cluster-with-argocd_ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster).

#### GitOps ZTP support for configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts in PolicyGenTemplate CRs

In GitOps ZTP v4.11+, a default policy compliance evaluation timeout value is available for use in `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs).
This value specifies how long the related `ConfigurationPolicy` CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before RHACM re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

Optionally, you can now override the default evaluation intervals for all policies in `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.

For more information, see [Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for PolicyGenTemplate CRs](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-policy-config.html#ztp-configuring-pgt-compliance-eval-timeouts_ztp-advanced-policy-config).

#### Specifying the platform type for managed clusters

The Assisted Installer currently supports the following OpenShift Container Platform platforms:

* `BareMetal`
* `VSphere`
* `None`

Single-node OpenShift does not support `VSphere`.

#### Configuring the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries

This release supports the use of unauthenticated registries when configuring the hub cluster.
Registries that do not require authentication are listed under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries` in the `AgentServiceConfig` resource.
Any registry on this list is not required to have an entry in the pull secret used for the spoke cluster installation.
`assisted-service` validates the pull secret by making sure it contains the authentication information for every image registry used for installation.

For more information, see [Configuring the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster.html#ztp-configuring-the-hub-cluster-to-use-unauthenticated-registries_ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster).

#### Ironic agent mirroring in disconnected GitOps ZTP installations

For disconnected installations using GitOps ZTP, if you are deploying OpenShift Container Platform version 4.11 or earlier to a spoke cluster with converged flow enabled, you must mirror the default Ironic agent image to the local image repository. The default Ironic agent images are the following:

* AMD64 Ironic agent image: `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:d3f1d4d3cd5fbcf1b9249dd71d01be4b901d337fdc5f8f66569eb71df4d9d446`
* AArch64 Ironic agent image: `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:cb0edf19fffc17f542a7efae76939b1e9757dc75782d4727fb0aa77ed5809b43`

For more information about mirroring images, see [Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository](../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.html#installation-mirror-repository_installing-mirroring-installation-images).

#### Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO by using GitOps ZTP

OpenShift Container Platform now supports specifying kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO in GitOps ZTP deployments. In both manual and automated GitOps ZTP deployments, the Discovery ISO is part of the OpenShift Container Platform installation process on managed bare-metal hosts. You can now edit the `InfraEnv` resource to specify kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO. This is useful for cluster installations with specific environmental requirements. For example, you can define the `rd.net.timeout.carrier` kernel argument to help configure the cluster for static networking.

For more information about how to specify kernel arguments, see [Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO by using GitOps ZTP](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.html#setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites) and [Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO for manual installations by using GitOps ZTP](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-manual-install.html#setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_ztp-manual-install).

#### Deploy heterogeneous spoke clusters from a hub cluster

With this update, you can create OpenShift Container Platform mixed-architecture clusters, also known as heterogeneous clusters, that feature hosts with both AMD64 and AArch64 CPU architectures. You can deploy a heterogeneous spoke cluster from a hub cluster managed by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM). To create a heterogeneous spoke cluster, add an AArch64 worker node to a deployed AMD64 cluster.

To add an AArch64 worker node to a deployed AMD64 cluster, you can specify the AArch64 architecture, the multi-architecture release image, and the operating system required for the node by using an `InfraEnv` custom resource (CR). You can then provision the AArch64 worker node to the AMD64 cluster by using the Assisted Installer API and the `InfraEnv` CR.

#### HTTP transport replaces AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events (Technology Preview)

HTTP is now the default transport in the PTP and bare-metal events infrastructure.
AMQ Interconnect is end of life (EOL) from 30 June 2024.

For more information, see [About the PTP fast event notifications framework](../networking/using-ptp.html#cnf-about-ptp-fast-event-notifications-framework_using-ptp).

### Insights Operator

#### Insights alerts

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, active Insights recommendations are now presented to the user as alerts. You can view and configure these alerts with Alertmanager.

#### Insights Operator data collection enhancements

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the Insights Operator now collects the following metrics:

* `console_helm_uninstalls_total`
* `console_helm_upgrades_total`

### Authentication and authorization

#### Application credentials on RHOSP

You can now specify [application credentials](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/users_and_identity_management_guide/application_credentials) in the `clouds.yaml` files of clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). Application credentials are an alternative to embedding user account details in configuration files. As an example, see the following section of a `clouds.yaml` file that includes user account details:

```
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            password: thepassword
            project_domain_name: Default
            project_name: theprojectname
            user_domain_name: Default
            username: theusername
        region_name: regionOne
```

Compare that section to one that uses application credentials:

```
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            application_credential_id: '5dc185489adc4b0f854532e1af81ffe0'
            application_credential_secret: 'PDCTKans2bPBbaEqBLiT_IajG8e5J_nJB4kvQHjaAy6ufhod0Zl0NkNoBzjn_bWSYzk587ieIGSlT11c4pVehA'
        auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
        region_name: regionOne
```

To use application credentials with your cluster as a RHOSP administrator, create the credentials. Then, use them in a `clouds.yaml` file when you install a cluster. Alternatively, you can create the `clouds.yaml` file and rotate it into an existing cluster.

### Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

#### HyperShift API beta release now available

The default version for the `hypershift.openshift.io` API, which is the API for hosted control planes on OpenShift Container Platform, is now v1beta1. Currently, for an existing cluster, the move from alpha to beta is not supported.

#### Versioning for hosted control planes

With each major, minor, or patch version release of OpenShift Container Platform, the HyperShift Operator is released. The HyperShift command-line interface (CLI) is released as part of each HyperShift Operator release.

The `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` API resources are available in the beta version of the API and follow a similar policy to [OpenShift Container Platform](../rest_api/overview/understanding-api-support-tiers.html) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

#### Backing up and restoring etcd on a hosted cluster

If you use hosted control planes on OpenShift Container Platform, you can back up and restore etcd by taking a snapshot of etcd and uploading it to a location where you can retrieve it later, such as an S3 bucket. Later, if needed, you can restore the snapshot. For more information, see [Backing up and restoring etcd on a hosted cluster](../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/etcd-backup-restore-hosted-cluster.html).

#### Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster within an AWS region

In a situation where you need disaster recovery for a hosted cluster, you can recover the hosted cluster to the same region within AWS. For more information, see [Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster within an AWS region](../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/dr-hosted-cluster-within-aws-region.html).

### Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)

This release provides several updates to Red Hat Virtualization (RHV). With this release:

* The oVirt CSI driver logging was revised with new error messages to improve the clarity and readability of the logs.
* The cluster API provider automatically updates oVirt and Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) credentials when they are changed in OpenShift Container Platform.

## Notable technical changes

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 introduces the following notable technical changes.

### AWS Security Token Service regional endpoints

The Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) now creates secrets that use regional endpoints for the [AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS)](../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.html). This approach aligns with AWS recommended best practices.

### cert-manager Operator general availability

cert-manager Operator is generally available in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.

### Credentials requests directory parameter for deleting GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

With this release, when you [delete GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility](../installing/installing_gcp/uninstalling-cluster-gcp.html#cco-ccoctl-deleting-sts-resources_uninstalling-cluster-gcp), you must specify the directory containing the files for the component `CredentialsRequest` objects.

### Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of OpenShift Container Platform. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the [Restricted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted) Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See [Identifying pod security violations](../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.html#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission) for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.
* See [Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards](../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.html#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission) to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:

  + The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
  + The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.
* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.
### Catalog sources and restricted pod security admission enforcement

Catalog sources built using the SQLite-based catalog format and a version of the `opm` CLI tool released before OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 cannot run under restricted pod security enforcement.

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, namespaces do not have restricted pod security enforcement by default and the default catalog source security mode is set to `legacy`.

If you do not want to run your SQLite-based catalog source pods under restricted pod security enforcement, you do not need to update your catalog source in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12. However, to ensure your catalog sources run in future OpenShift Container Platform releases, you must update your catalog sources to run under restricted pod security enforcement.

As a catalog author, you can enable compatibility with restricted pod security enforcement by completing either of the following actions:

* Migrate your catalog to the file-based catalog format.
* Update your catalog image with a version of the `opm` CLI tool released with OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 or later.

If you do not want to update your SQLite database catalog image or migrate your catalog to the file-based catalog format, you can configure your catalog to run with elevated permissions.

For more information, see [Catalog sources and pod security admission](../operators/admin/olm-managing-custom-catalogs.html#olm-catalog-sources-and-psa_olm-managing-custom-catalogs).

### Operator SDK 1.25.4

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 supports Operator SDK 1.25.4. See [Installing the Operator SDK CLI](../cli_reference/osdk/cli-osdk-install.html#cli-osdk-install) to install or update to this latest version.

|  | Operator SDK 1.25.4 supports Kubernetes 1.25.   For more information, see [Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25](../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis) and [Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25](../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html#ocp-4-12-osdk-bundle-validate-removed-kube-1-25-apis). |

### LVM Operator is now called Logical Volume Manager Storage

The LVM Operator that was previously delivered with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation requires installation through the OpenShift Data Foundation.
In OpenShift Container Platform v4.12, the LVM Operator has been renamed *Logical Volume Manager Storage*.
Now, you install it as a standalone Operator from the OpenShift Operator catalog.
Logical Volume Manager Storage provides dynamic provisioning of block storage on a single, limited resources single-node OpenShift cluster.

### End of support for RHOSP 16.1

OpenShift Container Platform no longer supports RHOSP 16.1 as a deployment target. See [OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform Support Matrix](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401) for complete details.

### Deprecated features

#### Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) as a host platform for OpenShift Container Platform will be deprecated

Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) will be deprecated in an upcoming release of OpenShift Container Platform. Support for OpenShift Container Platform on RHV will be removed from a future OpenShift Container Platform release, currently planned as OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.

#### Wildcard DNS queries for the `cluster.local` domain are deprecated

CoreDNS will stop supporting wildcard DNS queries for names under the `cluster.local` domain. These queries will resolve in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 as they do in earlier versions, but support will be removed from a future OpenShift Container Platform release.

#### Specific hardware models on `ppc64le`, `s390x`, and `x86_64` v1 CPU architectures are deprecated

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, support for RHCOS functionality is deprecated for:

* IBM POWER8 all models (ppc64le)
* IBM POWER9 AC922 (ppc64le)
* IBM POWER9 IC922 (ppc64le)
* IBM POWER9 LC922 (ppc64le)
* IBM z13 all models (s390x)
* LinuxONE Emperor (s390x)
* LinuxONE Rockhopper (s390x)
* AMD64 (x86\_64) v1 CPU

While these hardware models remain fully supported in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, Red Hat recommends that you use later hardware models.

#### Kuryr support for clusters that run on RHOSP

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, support for Kuryr on clusters that run on RHOSP is deprecated. Support will be removed no earlier than OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.

### Removed features

#### Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25

Kubernetes 1.25 removed the following deprecated APIs, so you must migrate manifests and API clients to use the appropriate API version. For more information about migrating removed APIs, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-25).

Table 13. APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25

| Resource | Removed API | Migrate to | Notable changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CronJob` | `batch/v1beta1` | `batch/v1` | No |
| `EndpointSlice` | `discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1` | `discovery.k8s.io/v1` | [Yes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125) |

1. For more information about pod security admission in OpenShift Container Platform, see [Understanding and managing pod security admission](../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.html#understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission).

#### Empty file and stdout support for the oc registry login command

The `--registry-config` and `--to option` options for the `oc registry login` command now stop accepting empty files.
These options continue to work with files that do not exist. The ability to write output to `-` (stdout) is also removed.

#### RHEL 7 support for the OpenShift CLI (oc) has been removed

Support for using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) has been removed. If you use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) with RHEL, you must use RHEL 8 or later.

#### OpenShift CLI (oc) commands have been removed

The following OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands were removed with this release:

* `oc adm migrate etcd-ttl`
* `oc adm migrate image-references`
* `oc adm migrate legacy-hpa`
* `oc adm migrate storage`

#### Grafana component removed from monitoring stack

The Grafana component is no longer a part of the OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 monitoring stack.
As an alternative, go to **Observe** â **Dashboards** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console to view monitoring dashboards.

#### Prometheus and Grafana user interface access removed from monitoring stack

Access to the third-party Prometheus and Grafana user interfaces have been removed from the OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 monitoring stack.
As an alternative, click **Observe** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console to view alerting, metrics, dashboards, and metrics targets for monitoring components.

#### Support for virtual hardware version 13 is removed

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, support for virtual hardware version 13 is removed. Support for virtual hardware version 13 was deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4.9. Red Hat recommends that you use virtual hardware version 15 or later.

#### Support for snapshot v1beta1 API endpoint is removed

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, support for `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` API endpoint is removed. Support for `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` API endpoint was deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4.7. Red Hat recommends that you use `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1`. All objects created as `v1beta1` are available through the v1 endpoint.

#### Support for manually deploying a custom scheduler has been removed

Support for deploying custom schedulers manually has been removed with this release. Use the [Secondary Scheduler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift](../nodes/scheduling/secondary_scheduler/index.html#nodes-secondary-scheduler-about_nodes-secondary-scheduler-about) instead to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in OpenShift Container Platform.

#### Support for deploying single-node OpenShift with OpenShiftSDN has been removed

Support for deploying single-node OpenShift clusters with OpenShiftSDN has been removed with this release. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for single-node OpenShift deployments.

#### Removal of Jenkins images from install payload

* OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 moves the "OpenShift Jenkins" and "OpenShift Agent Base" images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the OpenShift Container Platform lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the OpenShift Container Platform install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see [OpenShift Jenkins](../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.html#openshift-jenkins).
* OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 removes "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from its payload. Previously, OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 deprecated these images. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.

  However, upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 does not remove "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from 4.10 and earlier releases. And Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for these images through the end of the 4.10 release lifecycle, in accordance with the [OpenShift Container Platform lifecycle policy](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).

  For more information, see [OpenShift Jenkins](../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.html#openshift-jenkins).

### Future Kubernetes API removals

The next minor release of OpenShift Container Platform is expected to use Kubernetes 1.26. Currently, Kubernetes 1.26 is scheduled to remove several deprecated APIs.

See the [Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-26) in the upstream Kubernetes documentation for the list of planned Kubernetes API removals.

See [Navigating Kubernetes API deprecations and removals](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955985) for information about how to check your cluster for Kubernetes APIs that are planned for removal.

## Bug fixes

#### API Server and Authentication

* Previously, the Cluster Authentication Operator state was set to `progressing = false` after receiving a `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error. At the same time, `degraded = false` was kept for the time of the `inertia` defined. Consequently, the shortened amount of progressing and increased time of degradedation would create a situation where `progressing = false` and `degraded = false` were set prematurely. This caused inconsistent OpenShift CI tests because a healthy state was assumed, which was incorrect. This issue has been fixed by removing the `progressing = false` setting after the `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error is returned. Now, because there is no `progressing = false` state, OpenShift CI tests are more consistent. ([**BZ#2111842**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111842))
#### Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* In recent versions of server firmware the time between server operations has increased. This causes timeouts during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations when the OpenShift Container Platform installation program waits for a response from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). The new `python3-sushy` release increases the number of server side attempts to contact the BMC. This update accounts for the extended waiting time and avoids timeouts during installation. ([**OCPBUGS-4097**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4097))
* Before this update, the Ironic provisioning service did not support Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) that use weak eTags combined with strict eTag validation. By design, if the BMC provides a weak eTag, Ironic returns two eTags: the original eTag and the original eTag converted to the strong format for compatibility with BMC that do not support weak eTags. Although Ironic can send two eTags, BMC using strict eTag validation rejects such requests due to the presence of the second eTag. As a result, on some older server hardware, bare-metal provisioning failed with the following error: `HTTP 412 Precondition Failed`. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, this behavior changes and Ironic no longer attempts to send two eTags in cases where a weak eTag is provided. Instead, if a Redfish request dependent on an eTag fails with an eTag validation error, Ironic retries the request with known workarounds. This minimizes the risk of bare-metal provisioning failures on machines with strict eTag validation. ([**OCPBUGS-3479**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3479))
* Before this update, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot-related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed. ([**OCPBUGS-2052**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2052))
#### Builds

* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include [build input secrets](../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.html#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs). Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isnât available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:

  ```
  sourceStrategy:
  ...
    env:
      - name: "BUILDAH_QUIET"
        value: "true"
  ```

  ([**BZ#2099991**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2099991))
#### Cloud Compute

* Previously, instances were not set to respect the GCP infrastructure default option for automated restarts. As a result, instances could be created without using the infrastructure default for automatic restarts. This sometimes meant that instances were terminated in GCP but their associated machines were still listed in the `Running` state because they did not automatically restart. With this release, the code for passing the automatic restart option has been improved to better detect and pass on the default option selection from users. Instances now use the infrastructure default properly and are automatically restarted when the user requests the default functionality. ([**OCPBUGS-4504**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4504))
* The `v1beta1` version of the `PodDisruptionBudget` object is now deprecated in Kubernetes. With this release, internal references to `v1beta1` are replaced with `v1`. This change is internal to the cluster autoscaler and does not require user action beyond the advice in the [Preparing to upgrade to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955381) Red Hat Knowledgebase Article. ([**OCPBUGS-1484**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1484))
* Previously, the GCP machine controller reconciled the state of machines every 10 hours. Other providers set this value to 10 minutes so that changes that happen outside of the Machine API system are detected within a short period. The longer reconciliation period for GCP could cause unexpected issues such as missing certificate signing requests (CSR) approvals due to an external IP address being added but not detected for an extended period. With this release, the GCP machine controller is updated to reconcile every 10 minutes to be consistent with other platforms and so that external changes are picked up sooner. ([**OCPBUGS-4499**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4499))
* Previously, due to a deployment misconfiguration for the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set caused errors and sporadic Operator degradation. Because clusters with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled use two instances of the Cluster Machine Approver Operator and both deployments used the same set of ports, there was a conflict that lead to errors for single-node topology. With this release, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator deployment is updated to use a different set of ports for different deployments. ([**OCPBUGS-2621**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2621))
* Previously, the scale from zero functionality in Azure relied on a statically compiled list of instance types mapping the name of the instance type to the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance type. This list grew stale over time. With this release, information about instance type sizes is dynamically gathered from the Azure API directly to prevent the list from becoming stale. ([**OCPBUGS-2558**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2558))
* Previously, Machine API termination handler pods did not start on spot instances. As a result, pods that were running on tainted spot instances did not receive a termination signal if the instance was terminated. This could result in loss of data in workload applications. With this release, the Machine API termination handler deployment is modified to tolerate the taints and pods running on spot instances with taints now receive termination signals.
  ([**OCPBUGS-1274**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1274))
* Previously, error messages for Azure clusters did not explain that it is not possible to create new machines with public IP addresses for a disconnected install that uses only the internal publish strategy. With this release, the error message is updated for improved clarity. ([**OCPBUGS-519**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-519))
* Previously, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator did not check the `cloud-config` configuration file for AWS clusters. As a result, it was not possible to pass additional settings to the AWS cloud controller manager component by using the configuration file. With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator checks the infrastructure resource and parses references to the `cloud-config` configuration file so that users can configure additional settings. ([**BZ#2104373**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104373))
* Previously, when Azure added new instance types and enabled accelerated networking support on instance types that previously did not have it, the list of Azure instances in the machine controller became outdated. As a result, the machine controller could not create machines with instance types that did not previously support accelerated networking, even if they support this feature on Azure. With this release, the required instance type information is retrieved from Azure API before the machine is created to keep it up to date so the machine controller is able to create machines with new and updated instance types. This fix also applies to any instance types that are added in the future. ([**BZ#2108647**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108647))
* Previously, the cluster autoscaler did not respect the AWS, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud topology labels for the CSI drivers when using the Cluster API provider. As a result, nodes with the topology label were not processed properly by the autoscaler when attempting to balance nodes during a scale-out event. With this release, the autoscalerâs custom processors are updated so that it respects this label. The autoscaler can now balance similar node groups that are labeled by the AWS, IBM Cloud, or Alibaba CSI labels. ([**BZ#2001027**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001027))
* Previously, Power VS cloud providers were not capable of fetching the machine IP address from a DHCP server. Changing the IP address did not update the node, which caused some inconsistencies, such as pending certificate signing requests. With this release, the Power VS cloud provider is updated to fetch the machine IP address from the DHCP server so that the IP addresses for the nodes are consistent with the machine IP address. ([**BZ#2111474**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111474))
* Previously, machines created in early versions of OpenShift Container Platform with invalid configurations could not be deleted. With this release, the webhooks that prevent the creation of machines with invalid configurations no longer prevent the deletion of existing invalid machines. Users can now successfully remove these machines from their cluster by manually removing the finalizers on these machines. ([**BZ#2101736**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101736))
* Previously, short DHCP lease times, caused by `NetworkManager` not being run as a daemon or in continuous mode, caused machines to become stuck during initial provisioning and never become nodes in the cluster. With this release, extra checks are added so that if a machine becomes stuck in this state it is deleted and recreated automatically. Machines that are affected by this network condition can become nodes after a reboot from the Machine API controller. ([**BZ#2115090**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115090))
* Previously, when creating a new `Machine` resource using a machine profile that does not exist in IBM Cloud, the machines became stuck in the `Provisioning` phase. With this release, validation is added to the IBM Cloud Machine API provider to ensure that a machine profile exists, and machines with an invalid machine profile are rejected by the Machine API. ([**BZ#2062579**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062579))
* Previously, the Machine API provider for AWS did not verify that the security group defined in the machine specification exists. Instead of returning an error in this case, it used a default security group, which should not be used for OpenShift Container Platform machines, and successfully created a machine without informing the user that the default group was used. With this release, the Machine API returns an error when users set either incorrect or empty security group names in the machine specification. ([**BZ#2060068**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060068))
* Previously, the Machine API provider Azure did not treated user-provided values for instance types as case sensitive. This led to false-positive errors when instance types were correct but did not match the case. With this release, instance types are converted to the lowercase characters so that users get correct results without false-positive errors for mismatched case. ([**BZ#2085390**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085390))
* Previously, there was no check for nil values in the annotations of a machine object before attempting to access the object. This situation was rare, but caused the machine controller to panic when reconciling the machine. With this release, nil values are checked and the machine controller is able to reconcile machines without annotations. ([**BZ#2106733**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106733))
* Previously, the cluster autoscaler metrics for cluster CPU and memory usage would never reach, or exceed, the limits set by the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource. As a result, no alerts were fired when the cluster autoscaler could not scale due to resource limitations. With this release, a new metric called `cluster_autoscaler_skipped_scale_events_count` is added to the cluster autoscaler to more accurately detect when resource limits are reached or exceeded. Alerts will now fire when the cluster autoscaler is unable to scale the cluster up because it has reached the cluster resource limits. ([**BZ#1997396**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997396))
* Previously, when the Machine API provider failed to fetch the machine IP address, it would not set the internal DNS name and the machine certificate signing requests were not automatically approved. With this release, the Power VS machine provider is updated to set the server name as the internal DNS name even when it fails to fetch the IP address. ([**BZ#2111467**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111467))
* Previously, the Machine API vSphere machine controller set the `PowerOn` flag when cloning a VM. This created a `PowerOn` task that the machine controller was not aware of. If that `PowerOn` task failed, machines were stuck in the `Provisioned` phase but never powered on. With this release, the cloning sequence is altered to avoid the issue. Additionally, the machine controller now retries powering on the VM in case of failure and reports failures properly. ([**BZ#2087981**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2087981), [**OCPBUGS-954**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-954))
* With this release, AWS security groups are tagged immediately instead of after creation. This means that fewer requests are sent to AWS and the required user privileges are lowered. ([**BZ#2098054**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098054), [**OCPBUGS-3094**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3094))
* Previously, a bug in the RHOSP legacy cloud provider resulted in a crash if certain RHOSP operations were attempted after authentication had failed. For example, shutting down a server causes the Kubernetes controller manager to fetch server information from RHOSP, which triggered this bug. As a result, if initial cloud authentication failed or was configured incorrectly, shutting down a server caused the Kubernetes controller manager to crash. With this release, the RHOSP legacy cloud provider is updated to not attempt any RHOSP API calls if it has not previously authenticated successfully. Now, shutting down a server with invalid cloud credentials no longer causes Kubernetes controller manager to crash. ([**BZ#2102383**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102383))
#### Developer Console

* Previously, the `openshift-config` namespace was hard coded for the `HelmChartRepository` custom resource, which was the same namespace for the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource. This prevented users from adding private `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resources in their desired namespace. Consequently, users were unable to access secrets and configmaps in the `openshift-config` namespace. This update fixes the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource definition with a `namespace` field that can read the secret and configmaps from a namespace of choice by a user with the correct permissions. Additionally, the user can add secrets and configmaps to the accessible namespace, and they can add private Helm chart repositories in the namespace used the creation resources. ([**BZ#2071792**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071792))
#### Image Registry

* Previously, the image trigger controller did not have permissions to change objects. Consequently, image trigger annotations did not work on some resources. This update creates a cluster role binding that provides the controller the required permissions to update objects according to annotations. ([**BZ#2055620**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055620))
* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not have a `progressing` condition for the `node-ca` daemon set and used `generation` from an incorrect object. Consequently, the `node-ca` daemon set could be marked as `degraded` while the Operator was still running. This update adds the `progressing` condition, which indicates that the installation is not complete. As a result, the Image Registry Operator successfully installs the `node-ca` daemon set, and the installer waits until it is fully deployed. ([[**BZ#2093440**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093440))
#### Installer

* Previously, the number of supported user-defined tags was 8, and reserved OpenShift Container Platform tags were 2 for AWS resources. With this release, the number of supported user-defined tags is now 25 and reserved OpenShift Container Platform tags are 25 for AWS resources. You can now add up to 25 user tags during installation. ([**CFE#592**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-592))
* Previously, installing a cluster on Amazon Web Services started and then failed when the IAM administrative user was not assigned the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. This update adds this policy to checklist that the installation program uses to ensure that all of the required permissions are assigned. As a result, the installation program now stops the installation with a warning that the IAM administrative user is missing the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. ([**BZ#2109388**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109388))
* Previously, installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure failed when the Azure DCasv5-series or DCadsv5-series of confidential VMs were specified as control plane nodes. With this update, the installation program now stops the installation with an error, which states that confidential VMs are not yet supported. ([**BZ#2055247**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055247))
* Previously, gathering bootstrap logs was not possible until the control plane machines were running. With this update, gathering bootstrap logs now only requires that the bootstrap machine be available. ([**BZ#2105341**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105341))
* Previously, if a cluster failed to install on Google Cloud Platform because the service account had insufficient permissions, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now instructs users to check the permissions that are assigned to the service account. ([**BZ#2103236**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103236))
* Previously, when an installation on Google Cloud provider (GCP) failed because an invalid GCP region was specified, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now states the region is not valid. ([**BZ#2102324**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102324))
* Previously, cluster installations using Hive could fail if Hive used an older version of the install-config.yaml file. This update allows the installation program to accept older versions of the `install-config.yaml` file provided by Hive. ([**BZ#2098299**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098299))
* Previously, the installation program would incorrectly allow the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` parameters to use the same IPv6 address if they represented the address differently, such as listing the address in an abbreviated format. In this update, the installer correctly validates these two parameters regardless of their formatting, requiring separate IP addresses for each parameter. ([**BZ#2103144**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103144))
* Previously, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program failed to delete all resources in clusters installed on GCP if the cluster name was more than 22 characters long. In this update, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program correctly locates and deletes all GCP cluster resources in cases of long cluster names. ([**BZ#2076646**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076646))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) with multiple networks defined in the `machineNetwork` parameter, the installation program only created security group rules for the first network. With this update, the installation program creates security group rules for all networks defined in the `machineNetwork` so that users no longer need to manually edit security group rules after installation. ([**BZ#2095323**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095323))
* Previously, users could manually set the API and Ingress virtual IP addresses to values that conflicted with the allocation pool of the DHCP server when installing a cluster on OpenStack. This could cause the DHCP server to assign one of the VIP addresses to a new machine, which would fail to start. In this update, the installation program validates the user-provided VIP addresses to ensure that they do not conflict with any DHCP pools. ([**BZ#1944365**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944365))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on vSphere using a datacenter that is embedded inside a folder, the installation program could not locate the datacenter object, causing the installation to fail. In this update, the installation program can traverse the directory that contains the datacenter object, allowing the installation to succeed. ([**BZ#2097691**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097691))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on Azure using arm64 architecture with installer-provisioned infrastructure, the image definition resource for `hyperVGeneration` V1 incorrectly had an architecture value of `x64`. With this update, the image definition resource for `hyperVGeneration` V1 has the correct architecture value of `Arm64`. ([**OCPBUGS-3639**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3639))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation could fail if the user specified a user-defined folder in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program correctly validates user-defined folders in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. ([**OCPBUGS-3343**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3343))
* Previously, when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failed on VMware vSphere, some virtual machine folders were not destroyed. This error could occur in clusters configured with multiple vSphere datacenters or multiple vSphere clusters. With this update, all installer-provisioned infrastructure is correctly deleted when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failure. ([**OCPBUGS-1489**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1489))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user specified the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` parameter but did not specify the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program alerts the user that the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` field is required when specifying `platform.vsphere.vcenters`. ([**OCPBUGS-1698**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1698))
* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user defined the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` and `platform.vsphere.failureDomains` parameters but did not define `platform.vsphere.defaultMachinePlatform.zones`, or `compute.platform.vsphere.zones` and `controlPlane.platform.vsphere.zones`. With this update, the installation program validates that the user has defined the `zones` parameter in multi-region or multi-zone deployments prior to installation. ([**OCPBUGS-1490**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1490))
#### Kubernetes Controller Manager

* Previously, the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator reported `degraded` on environments without a monitoring stack presence. With this update, the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator skips checking the monitoring for cues about degradation when the monitoring stack is not present. ([**BZ#2118286**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2118286))
* With this update, Kubernetes Controller Manager alerts (`KubeControllerManagerDown`, `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit`, `PodDisruptionBudgetLimit`, and `GarbageCollectorSyncFailed`) have links to Github runbooks. The runbooks help users to understand debug these alerts. ([**BZ#2001409**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001409))
#### Kubernetes Scheduler

* Previously, the secondary scheduler deployment was not deleted after a secondary scheduler custom resource was deleted. Consequently, the Secondary Schedule Operator and Operand were not fully uninstalled. With this update, the correct owner reference is set in the secondary scheduler custom resource so that it points to the secondary scheduler deployment. As a result, secondary scheduler deployments are deleted when the secondary scheduler custom resource is deleted. ([**BZ#2100923**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100923))
* For the OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 release, the descheduler can now publish events to an API group because the release adds additional role-based access controls (RBAC) rules to the deschedulerâs profile.([**OCPBUGS-2330**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2330))
#### Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) `ControllerConfig` resource, which contains important certificates, was only synced if the Operatorâs daemon sync succeeded. By design, unready nodes during a daemon sync prevent that daemon sync from succeeding, so unready nodes were indirectly preventing the `ControllerConfig` resource, and therefore those certificates, from syncing. This resulted in eventual cluster degradation when there were unready nodes due to inability to rotate the certificates contained in the `ControllerConfig` resource. With this release, the sync of the `ControllerConfig` resource is no longer dependent on the daemon sync succeeding, so the `ControllerConfig` resource now continues to sync if the daemon sync fails. This means that unready nodes no longer prevent the `ControllerConfig` resource from syncing, so certificates continue to be updated even when there are unready nodes. ([**BZ#2034883**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2034883))
#### Management Console

* Previously, the **Operator details** page attempted to display multiple error messages, but the error message component can only display a single error message at a time. As a result, relevant error messages were not displayed. With this update, the **Operator details** page displays only the first error message so the user sees a relevant error. ([**OCPBUGS-3927**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3927))
* Previously, the product name for Azure Red Hat OpenShift was incorrect in Customer Case Management (CCM). As a result, the console had to use the same incorrect product name to correctly populate the fields in CCM. Once the product name in CCM was updated, the console needed to be updated as well. With this update, the same, correct product name as CCM is correctly populated with the correct Azure product name when following the link from the console. ([**OCPBUGS-869**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-869))
* Previously, when a plugin page resulted in an error, the error did not reset when navigating away from the error page, and the error persisted after navigating to a page that was not the cause of the error. With this update, the error state is reset to its default when a user navigates to a new page, and the error no longer persists after navigating to a new page. ([**BZ#2117738**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117738), [**OCPBUGS-523**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-523))
* Previously, the ***View it here*** link in the **Operator details** pane for installed Operators was incorrectly built when ***All Namespaces*** was selected. As a result, the link attempted to navigate to the **Operator details** page for a cluster service version (CSV) in **All Projects**, which is an invalid route. With this update, the ***View it here*** link to use the namespace where the CSV is installed now builds correctly and the link works as expected. ([**OCPBUGS-184**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-184))
* Previously, line numbers with more than five digits resulted in a cosmetic issue where the line number overlaid the vertical divider between the line number and the line contents making it harder to read. With this update, the amount of space available for line numbers was increased to account for longer line numbers, and the line number no longer overlays the vertical divider. ([**OCPBUGS-183**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-183))
* Previously, in the administrator perspective of the web console, the link to ***Learn more about the OpenShift local update services*** on the **Default update server** pop-up window in the **Cluster Settings** page produced a 404 error. With this update, the link works as expected. ([**BZ#2098234**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098234))
* Previously, the `MatchExpression` component did not account for array-type values. As a result, only single values could be entered through forms using this component. With this update, the `MatchExpression` component accepts comma-separated values as an array. ([**BZ#207690**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079690))
* Previously, there were redundant checks for the model resulting in tab reloading which occasionally resulted in a flickering of the tab contents where they rerendered. With this update, the redundant model check was removed, and the model is only checked once. As a result, the tab contents do not flicker and no longer rerender. ([**BZ#2037329**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037329))
* Previously, when selecting the `edit` label from the action list on the OpenShift Dedicated node page, no response was elicited and a web hook error was returned. This issue has been fixed so that the error message is only returned when editing fails. ([**BZ#2102098**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102098))
* Previously, if issues were pending, clicking on the **Insights** link would crash the page. As a workaround, you can wait for the variable to become `initialized` before clicking the **Insights** link. As a result, the Insights page will open as expected. ([**BZ#2052662**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052662))
* Previously, when the `MachineConfigPool` resource was paused, the option to unpause said **Resume rollouts**. The wording has been updated so that it now says **Resume updates**. ([**BZ#2094240**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094240))
* Previously, the wrong calculating method was used when counting master and worker nodes. With this update, the correct worker nodes are calculated when nodes have both the `master` and `worker` role. ([**BZ#1951901**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1951901))
* Previously, conflicting `react-router` routes for `ImageManifestVuln` resulted in attempts to render a details page for `ImageManifestVuln` with a `~new` name. Now, the container security plugin has been updated to remove conflicting routes and to ensure dynamic lists and details page extensions are used on the Operator details page. As a result, the console renders the correct create, list, and details pages for `ImageManifestVuln`. ([**BZ#2080260**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080260))
* Previously, incomplete YAML was not synced was occasionally displayed to users. With this update, synced YAML always displays. ([**BZ#2084453**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084453))
* Previously, when installing an Operator that required a custom resource (CR) to be created for use, the **Create resource** button could fail to install the CR because it was pointing to the incorrect namespace. With this update, the **Create resource** button works as expected. ([**BZ#2094502**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094502))
* Previously, the **Cluster update** modal was not displaying errors properly. As a result, the **Cluster update** modal did not display or explain errors when they occurred. With this update, the **Cluster update** modal correctly display errors. ([**BZ#2096350**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096350))
#### Monitoring

* Before this update, cluster administrators could not distinguish between a pod being not ready because of a scheduling issue and a pod being not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. In both cases, the `KubePodNotReady` alert would fire. With this update, the `KubePodNotScheduled` alert now fires when a pod is not ready because of a scheduling issue, and the `KubePodNotReady` alert fires when a pod is not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. ([**OCPBUGS-4431**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4431))
* Before this update, `node_exporter` would report metrics about virtual network interfaces such as `tun` interfaces, `br` interfaces, and `ovn-k8s-mp` interfaces. With this update, metrics for these virtual interfaces are no longer collected, which decreases monitoring resource consumption. ([**OCPBUGS-1321**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1321))
* Before this update, Alertmanager pod startup might time out because of slow DNS resolution, and the Alertmanager pods would not start. With this release, the timeout value has been increased to seven minutes, which prevents pod startup from timing out. ([**BZ#2083226**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083226))
* Before this update, if Prometheus Operator failed to run or schedule Prometheus pods, the system provided no underlying reason for the failure. With this update, if Prometheus pods are not run or scheduled, the Cluster Monitoring Operator updates the `clusterOperator` monitoring status with a reason for the failure, which can be used to troubleshoot the underlying issue. ([**BZ#2043518**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043518))
* Before this update, if you created an alert silence from the **Developer** perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, external labels were included that did not match the alert. Therefore, the alert would not be silenced. With this update, external labels are now excluded when you create a silence in the **Developer** perspective so that newly created silences function as expected. ([**BZ#2084504**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084504))
* Previously, if you enabled an instance of Alertmanager dedicated to user-defined projects, a misconfiguration could occur in certain circumstances, and you would not be informed that the user-defined project Alertmanager config map settings did not load for either the main instance of Alertmanager or the instance dedicated to user-defined projects. With this release, if this misconfiguration occurs, the Cluster Monitoring Operator now displays a message that informs you of the issue and provides resolution steps. ([**BZ#2099939**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2099939))
* Before this update, if the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) failed to update Prometheus, the CMO did not verify whether a previous deployment was running and would report that cluster monitoring was unavailable even if one of the Prometheus pods was still running. With this update, the CMO now checks for running Prometheus pods in this situation and reports that cluster monitoring is unavailable only if no Prometheus pods are running. ([**BZ#2039411**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039411))
* Before this update, if you configured OpsGenie as an alert receiver, a warning would appear in the log that `api_key` and `api_key_file` are mutually exclusive and that `api_key` takes precedence. This warning appeared even if you had not defined `api_key_file`. With this update, this warning only appears in the log if you have defined both `api_key` and `api_key_file`. ([**BZ#2093892**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093892))
* Before this update the Telemeter Client (TC) only loaded new pull secrets when it was manually restarted. Therefore, if a pull secret had been changed or updated and the TC had not been restarted, the TC would fail to authenticate with the server. This update addresses the issue so that when the secret is rotated, the deployment is automatically restarted and uses the updated token to authenticate. ([**BZ#2114721**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2114721))
#### Networking

* Previously, routers that were in the terminating state delayed the `oc cp` command which would delay the `oc adm must-gather` command until the pod was terminated. With this update, a timeout for each issued `oc cp` command is set to prevent delaying the `must-gather` command from running. As a result, terminating pods no longer delay `must-gather` commands. ([**BZ#2103283**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103283))
* Previously, an Ingress Controller could not be configured with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. With this update, users can now configure an Ingress Controller with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. ([**BZ#2104481**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104481))
* Previously, the `routeSelector` parameter cleared the route status of the Ingress Controller prior to the router deployment. Because of this, the route status repopulated incorrectly. To avoid using stale data, route status detection has been updated to no longer rely on the Kubernetes object cache. Additionally, this update includes a fix to check the generation ID on route deployment to determine the route status. As a result, the route status is consistently cleared with a `routeSelector` update. ([**BZ#2101878**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101878))
* Previously, a cluster that was upgraded from a version of OpenShift Container Platform earlier than 4.8 could have orphaned `Route` objects. This was caused by earlier versions of OpenShift Container Platform translating `Ingress` objects into `Route` objects irrespective of a given `Ingress` objectâs indicated `IngressClass`. With this update, an alert is sent to the cluster administrator about any orphaned Route objects still present in the cluster after Ingress-to-Route translation. This update also adds another alert that notifies the cluster administrator about any Ingress objects that do not specify an `IngressClass`. ([**BZ#1962502**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962502))
* Previously, if a `configmap` that the router deployment depends on is not created, then the router deployment does not progress. With this update, the cluster Operator reports `ingress progressing=true` if the default ingress controller deployment is progressing. This results in users debugging issues with the ingress controller by using the command `oc get co`. ([**BZ#2066560**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066560))
* Previously, when an incorrectly created network policy was added to the OVN-Kubernetes cache, it would cause the OVN-Kubernetes leader to enter `crashloopbackoff` status. With this update, OVN-Kubernetes leader does not enter `crashloopbackoff` status by skipping deleting nil policies. ([**BZ#2091238**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091238))
* Previously, recreating an EgressIP pod with the same namespace or name within 60 seconds of deleting an older one with the same namespace or name causes the wrong SNAT to be configured. As a result, packets could go out with nodeIP instead of EgressIP SNAT. With this update, traffic leaves the pod with EgressIP instead of nodeIP. ([**BZ#2097243**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097243)).
* Previously, older Access Control Lists (ACL)s with `arp` produced `unexpectedly found multiple equivalent ACLs (arp v/s arp||nd)` errors due to a change in the ACL from `arp` to `arp II nd`. This prevented network policies from being created properly. With this update, older ACLs with just the `arp` match have been removed so that only ACLs with the new `arp II nd` match exist so that network policies can be created correctly and no errors will be observed on `ovnkube-master`. NOTE: This effects customers upgrading into 4.8.14, 4.9.32, 4.10.13 or higher from older versions. ([**BZ#2095852**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095852)).
* With this update, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.10.0, which is based on Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the CoreDNS version and OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. ([**OCPBUGS-1731**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1731))
* With this update, the OpenShift Container Platform router now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the `openshift-router` and OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. ([**OCPBUGS-1730**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1730))
* With this update, the Ingress Operator now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the Ingress Operator and OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. ([**OCPBUGS-1554**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1554))
* Previously, the DNS Operator did not reconcile the `openshift-dns` namespace. Because OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 requires the `openshift-dns` namespace to have pod-security labels, this caused the namespace to be missing those labels upon cluster update. Without the pod-security labels, the pods failed to start. With this update, the DNS Operator now reconciles the `openshift-dns` namespace, and the pod-security labels are now present. As a result, pods start as expected. ([**OCPBUGS-1549**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1549))
* Previously, the `ingresscontroller.spec.tuniningOptions.reloadInterval` did not support decimal numerals as valid parameter values because the Ingress Operator internally converts the specified value into milliseconds, which was not a supported time unit. This prevented an Ingress Controller from being deleted. With this update, `ingresscontroller.spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` now supports decimal numerals and users can delete Ingress Controllers with `reloadInterval` parameter values which were previously unsupported. ([**OCPBUGS-236**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-236))
* Previously, the Cluster DNS Operator used GO Kubernetes libraries that were based on Kubernetes 1.24 while OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 is based on Kubernetes 1.25. With this update, GO Kubernetes API is v1.25.2, which aligns the Cluster DNS Operator with OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 that uses Kubernetes 1.25 APIs. (link: [**OCPBUGS-1558**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1558))
* Previously, setting the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration to `true` did not persist when the `network-operator` pod was re-created. With this update, the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration property of network `operator.openshift.io/cluster` no longer resets to its default value after network operator restart. ([**OCPBUGS-392**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-392))
* Previously, `ovn-kubernetes` did not configure the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge. As a result, a node that uses bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface fails to join the cluster. With this update, `ovn-kubernetes` configures the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge, and nodes that use bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface successfully join the cluster. ([**BZ2096413**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096413))
* Previously, when the Ingress Operator was configured to enable the use of mTLS, the Operator would not check if CRLs needed updating until some other event caused it to reconcile. As a result, CRLs used for mTLS could become out of date. With this update, the Ingress Operator now automatically reconciles when any CRL expires, and CRLs will be updated at the time specified by their `nextUpdate` field. ([**BZ#2117524**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117524))
#### Node

* Previously, a symlinks error message was printed out as raw data instead of formatted as an error, making it difficult to understand. This fix formats the error message properly, so that it is easily understood. ([**BZ#1977660**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977660))
* Previously, kubelet hard eviction thresholds were different from Kubernetes defaults when a performance profile was applied to a node. With this release, the defaults have been updated to match the expected Kubernetes defaults. ([**OCPBUGS-4362**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4362)).
#### OpenShift CLI (oc)

* The OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 release fixes an issue with entering a debug session on a target node when the target namespace lacks the appropriate security level. This caused the `oc` CLI to prompt you with a pod security error message. If the existing namespace does not contain the appropriate security levels, OpenShift Container Platform now creates a temporary namespace when you enter `oc` debug mode on a target node. ([OCPBUGS-852](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-852))
* Previously, on macOS arm64 architecture, the `oc` binary needed to be signed manually. As a result, the `oc` binary did not work as expected. This update implements a self-signing binary for `oc` mimicking. As a result, the `oc` binary on macOS arm64 architectures works properly. ([**BZ#2059125**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059125))
* Previously, `must-gather` was trying to collect resources that were not present on the server. Consequently, `must-gather` would print error messages. Now, before collecting resources, `must-gather` checks whether the resource exists. As a result, `must-gather` no longer prints an error when it fails to collect non-existing resources on the server. ([**BZ#2095708**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095708))
* The OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 release updates the `oc-mirror` library, so that the library supports multi-arch platform images. This means that you can choose from a wider selection of architectures, such as `arm64`, when mirroring a platform release payload. ([**OCPBUGS-617**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-617))
#### Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before the OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 release, the `package-server-manager` controller would not revert any changes made to a `package-server` cluster service version (CSV), because of an issue with the `on-cluster` function. These persistent changes might impact how an Operator starts in a cluster. For OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the `package-server-manager` controller always rebuilds a `package-server` CSV to its original state, so that no modifications to the CSV persist after a cluster upgrade operation. The `on-cluster` function no longer controls the state of a `package-server` CSV. ([**OCPBUGS-867**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-867))
* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would attempt to update namespaces to apply a label, even if the label was present on the namespace. Consequently, the update requests increased the workload in API and etcd services. With this update, OLM compares existing labels against the expected labels on a namespace before issuing an update. As a result, OLM no longer attempts to make unnecessary update requests on namespaces. ([**BZ#2105045**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045))
* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would prevent minor cluster upgrades that should not be blocked based on a miscalculation of the `ClusterVersion` custom resourcesâs `spec.DesiredVersion` field. With this update, OLM no longer prevents cluster upgrades when the upgrade should be supported. ([**BZ#2097557**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097557))
* Previously, the reconciler would update a resourceâs annotation without making a copy of the resource. This caused an error that would terminate the reconciler process. With this update, the reconciler no longer stops due the error. ([**BZ#2105045**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045))
* The `package-server-manifest` (PSM) is a controller that ensures that the correct `package-server` Cluster Service Version (CSV) is installed on a cluster. Previously, changes to the `package-server` CSV were not being reverted because of a logical error in the reconcile function in which an on-cluster object could influence the expected object. Users could modify the `package-server` CSV and the changes would not be reverted. Additionally, cluster upgrades would not update the YAML for the `package-server` CSV. With this update, the expected version of the CSV is now always built from scratch, which removes the ability for an on-cluster object to influence the expected values. As a result, the PSM now reverts any attempts to modify the `package-server` CSV, and cluster upgrades now deploy the expected `package-server` CSV. ([**OCPBUGS-858**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-858))
* Previously, OLM would upgrade an Operator according to the Operatorâs CRD status. A CRD lists component references in an order defined by the group/version/kind (GVK) identifier. Operators that share the same components might cause the GVK to change the component listings for an Operator, and this can cause the OLM to require more system resources to continuously update the status of a CRD. With this update, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) now upgrades an Operator according to the Operatorâs component references. A change to the custom resource definition (CRD) status of an Operator does not impact the OLM Operator upgrade process.([**OCPBUGS-3795**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3795))
#### Operator SDK

* With this update, you can now set the security context for the registry pod by including the `securityContext` configuration field in the pod specification. This will apply the security context for all containers in the pod. The `securityContext` field also defines the podâs privileges. ([**BZ#2091864**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091864))
#### File Integrity Operator

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator deployed templates using the `openshift-file-integrity` namespace in the permissions for the Operator. When the Operator attempted to create objects in the namespace, it would fail due to permission issues. With this release, the deployment resources used by OLM are updated to use the correct namespace, fixing the permission issues so that users can install and use the operator in non-default namespaces. ([**BZ#2104897**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104897))
* Previously, underlying dependencies of the File Integrity Operator changed how alerts and notifications were handled, and the Operator didnât send metrics as a result. With this release the Operator ensures that the metrics endpoint is correct and reachable on startup. ([**BZ#2115821**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115821))
* Previously, alerts issued by the File Integrity Operator did not set a namespace. This made it difficult to understand where the alert was coming from, or what component was responsible for issuing it. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. ([**BZ#2101393**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101393))
* Previously, the File Integrity Operator did not properly handle modifying alerts during an upgrade. As a result, alerts did not include the namespace in which the Operator was installed. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. ([**BZ#2112394**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2112394))
* Previously, service account ownership for the File Integrity Operator regressed due to underlying OLM updates, and updates from 0.1.24 to 0.1.29 were broken. With this update, the Operator defaults to upgrading to 0.1.30. ([**BZ#2109153**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109153))
* Previously, the File Integrity Operator daemon used the `ClusterRoles` parameter instead of the `Roles` parameter for a recent permission change. As a result, OLM could not update the Operator. With this release, the Operator daemon reverts to using the `Roles` parameter and updates from older versions to version 0.1.29 are successful. ([**BZ#2108475**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108475))
#### Compliance Operator

* Previously, the Compliance Operator used an old version of the Operator SDK, which is a dependency for building Operators. This caused alerts about deprecated Kubernetes functionality used by the Operator SDK. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to version 0.1.55, which includes an updated version of the Operator SDK. ([**BZ#2098581**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098581))
* Previously, applying automatic remediation for the `rhcos4-high-master-sysctl-kernel-yama-ptrace-scope` and `rhcos4-sysctl-kernel-core-pattern` rules resulted in subsequent failures of those rules in scan results, even though they were remediated. The issue is fixed in this release. ([**BZ#2094382**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094382))
* Previously, the Compliance Operator hard coded notifications to the default namespace. As a result, notifications from the Operator would not appear if the Operator was installed in a different namespace. This issue is fixed in this release. ([**BZ#2060726**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060726))
* Previously, the Compliance Operator failed to fetch API resources when parsing machine configurations without Ignition specifications. This caused the `api-check-pods` check to crash loop. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to gracefully handle machine configuration pools without Ignition specifications. ([**BZ#2117268**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117268))
* Previously, the Compliance Operator held machine configurations in a stuck state because it could not determine the relationship between machine configurations and kubelet configurations. This was due to incorrect assumptions about machine configuration names. With this release, the Compliance Operator is able to determine if a kubelet configuration is a subset of a machine configuration. ([**BZ#2102511**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102511))
#### OpenShift API server

* Previously, adding a member could remove previous members from a group. As a result, the user lost group privileges. With this release, the dependencies were bumped and users no longer lose group privledges. ([**OCPBUGS-533**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-533))
#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from using custom images with toolbox containers on RHCOS. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now use custom images with toolbox on RHCOS as expected. ([**BZ#2048789**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048789))
* Previously, the `podman exec` command did not work well with nested containers. Users encountered this issue when accessing a node using the `oc debug` command and then running a container with the `toolbox` command. Because of this, users were unable to reuse toolboxes on RHCOS. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for this behavior, so users can now reuse toolboxes on RHCOS. ([**BZ#1915537**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915537))
* With this update, running the `toolbox` command now checks for updates to the default image before launching the container. This improves security and provides users with the latest bug fixes. ([**BZ#2049591**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049591))
* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from running the `toolbox` command on RHCOS. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now run `toolbox` on RHCOS as expected. ([**BZ#2093040**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093040))
* Previously, custom SELinux policy modules were not properly supported by `rpm-ostree`, so they were not updated along with the rest of the system upon update. This would surface as failures in unrelated components. Pending SELinux userspace improvements landing in a future OpenShift Container Platform release, this update provides a workaround to RHCOS that will rebuild and reload the SELinux policy during boot as needed. ([**OCPBUGS-595**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-595))
#### Scalability and performance

* The tuned profile has been modified to assign the same priority as `ksoftirqd` and `rcuc` to the newly introduced per-CPU kthreads (`ktimers`) added in a recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernel patch. For more information, see [**OCPBUGS-3475**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3475), [**BZ#2117780**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117780) and [**BZ#2122220**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2122220).
* Previously, restarts of the `tuned` service caused improper reset of the `irqbalance` configuration, leading to IRQ operation being served again on the isolated CPUs, therefore violating the isolation guarantees. With this fix, the `irqbalance` service configuration is properly preserved across `tuned` service restarts (explicit or caused by bugs), therefore preserving the CPU isolation guarantees with respect to IRQ serving. ([**OCPBUGS-585**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-585))
* Previously, when the tuned daemon was restarted out of order as part of the cluster Node Tuning Operator, the CPU affinity of interrupt handlers was reset and the tuning was compromised. With this fix, the `irqbalance` plugin in tuned is disabled, and OpenShift Container Platform now relies on the logic and interaction between `CRI-O` and `irqbalance`.([**BZ#2105123**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105123))
* Previously, a low latency hook script executing for every new `veth` device took too long when the node was under load. The resultant accumulated delays during pod start events caused the rollout time for `kube-apiserver` to be slow and sometimes exceed the 5-minute rollout timeout. With this fix, the container start time should be shorter and within the 5-minute threshold. ([**BZ#2109965**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109965)).
* Previously, the `oslat` control thread was collocated with one of the test threads, which caused latency spikes in the measurements. With this fix, the `oslat` runner now reserves one CPU for the control thread, meaning the test uses one less CPU for running the busy threads. ([**BZ#2051443**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051443))
* Latency measurement tools, also known as `oslat`, `cyclictest`, and `hwlatdetect`, now run on completely isolated CPUs without the helper process running in the background that might cause latency spikes, therefore providing more accurate latency measurements. ([**OCPBUGS-2618**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2618))
* Previously, although the reference `PolicyGenTemplate` for `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` includes two `StorageClass` entries, the generated policy included only one. With this update, the generated policy now includes both policies. ([**BZ#2049306**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049306)).
#### Storage

* Previously, checks for generic ephemeral volumes failed. With this update, checks for expandable volumes now include generic ephemeral volumes. ([**BZ#2082773**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082773))
* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart. With this update, a warning appears when there is more than one secret on the vCenter CSI Operator. ([**BZ#2108473**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108473))
* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform detached a volume when a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver was not able to unmount the volume from a node. Detaching a volume without unmount is not allowed by CSI specifications and drivers could enter an `undocumented` state. With this update, CSI drivers are detached before unmounting only on unhealthy nodes preventing the `undocumented` state. ([**BZ#2049306**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049306))
* Previously, there were missing annotations on the Manila CSI Driver Operatorâs VolumeSnapshotClass. Consequently, the Manila CSI snapshotter could not locate secrets, and could not create snapshots with the default VolumeSnapshotClass. This update fixes the issue so that secret names and namespaces are included in the default VolumeSnapshotClass. As a result, users can now create snapshots in the Manila CSI Driver Operator using the default VolumeSnapshotClass. ([**BZ#2057637**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057637))
* Users can now opt into using the experimental VHD feature on Azure File. To opt in, users must specify the `fstype` parameter in a storage class and enable it with `--enable-vhd=true`. If `fstype` is used and the feature is not set to `true`, the volumes will fail to provision.

  To opt out of using the VHD feature, remove the `fstype` parameter from your storage class. ([**BZ#2080449**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080449))
* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart. With this update, a warning appears when there is more than one secret on the vCenter CSI Operator. ([**BZ#2108473**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108473))
#### Web console (Developer perspective)

* Previously, the users could not deselect a Git secret in add and edit forms. As a result, the resources had to be recreated. This fix resolves the issue by adding the option to choose `No Secret` in the select secret option list. As a result, the users can easily select, deselect, or detach any attached secrets. ([**BZ#2089221**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089221))
* In OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, when it is minimal or no data in the **Developer Perspective**, most of the monitoring charts or graphs (CPU consumption, memory usage, and bandwidth) show a range of -1 to 1. However, none of these values can ever go below zero. This will be resolved in a future release. ([**BZ#1904106**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904106))
* Before this update, users could not silence alerts in the **Developer** perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console when a user-defined Alertmanager service was deployed because the web console would forward the request to the platform Alertmanager service in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. With this update, when you view the **Developer** perspective in the web console and try to silence an alert, the request is forwarded to the correct Alertmanager service. ([**OCPBUGS-1789**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1789))
* Previously, there was a known issue in the **Add Helm Chart Repositories** form to extend the Developer Catalog of a project. The **Quick Start** guides shows that you can add the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR in the required namespace whereas it does not mention that to perform this you need permission from the kubeadmin. This issue was resolved with **Quickstart** mentioning the correct steps to create `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR. ([**BZ#2057306**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057306))

## Known issues

* In OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.

  If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 to 4.12, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.

  |  | If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access. |
  | --- | --- |

  Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:

  ```
  ## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
  $ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
  do
  ### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
  index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
  ### Remove the element at index from subjects array
  oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
  done
  ```

  This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:

  + `cluster-status-binding`
  + `discovery`
  + `system:basic-user`
  + `system:discovery`
  + `system:openshift:discovery`

  ([**BZ#1821771**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771))

* Intermittently, an IBM Cloud VPC cluster might fail to install because some worker machines do not start. Rather, these worker machines remain in the `Provisioned` phase.

  There is a workaround for this issue. From the host where you performed the initial installation, delete the failed machines and run the installation program again.

  1. Verify that the status of the internal application load balancer (ALB) for the master API server is `active`.

     1. Identify the clusterâs infrastructure ID by running the following command:

        ```
        $ oc get infrastructure/cluster -ojson | jq -r '.status.infrastructureName'
        ```
     2. Log into the IBM Cloud account for your cluster and target the correct region for your cluster.
     3. Verify that the internal ALB status is `active` by running the following command:

        ```
        $ ibmcloud is lb <cluster_ID>-kubernetes-api-private  --output json | jq -r '.provisioning_status'
        ```
  2. Identify the machines that are in the `Provisioned` phase by running the following command:

     ```
     $ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
     ```

     Example output
     ```
     NAME                                    PHASE         TYPE       REGION    ZONE        AGE
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-0         Running       bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-1   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-1         Running       bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-2   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-2         Running       bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-3   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-1-xqzzm   Running       bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-1   22h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-2-vg9w6   Provisioned   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-2   22h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-3-2f7zd   Provisioned   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-3   22h
     ```
  3. Delete each failed machine by running the following command:

     ```
     $ oc delete machine <name_of_machine> -n openshift-machine-api
     ```
  4. Wait for the deleted worker machines to be replaced, which can take up to 10 minutes.
  5. Verify that the new worker machines are in the `Running` phase by running the following command:

     ```
     $ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
     ```

     Example output
     ```
     NAME                                    PHASE     TYPE       REGION    ZONE        AGE
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-0         Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-1   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-1         Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-2   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-master-2         Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-3   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-1-xqzzm   Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-1   23h
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-2-mnlsz   Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-2   8m2s
     example-public-1-x4gpn-worker-3-7nz4q   Running   bx2-4x16   us-east   us-east-3   7m24s
     ```
  6. Complete the installation by running the following command. Running the installation program again ensures that the clusterâs `kubeconfig` is initialized properly:

     ```
     $ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete
     ```

     ([**OCPBUGS#1327**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1327))

* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. ([**BZ#1917280**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280))
* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see [Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305).
* When using the egress IP address feature in OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP, you can assign a floating IP address to a reservation port to have a predictable SNAT address for egress traffic. The floating IP address association must be created by the same user that installed the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Otherwise any delete or move operation for the egress IP address hangs indefinitely because of insufficient privileges. When this issue occurs, a user with sufficient privileges must manually unset the floating IP address association to resolve the issue. ([**OCPBUGS-4902**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4902))
* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. ([**KCS**](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743))
* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. ([**BZ#2050824**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824))
* Due to an unresolved metadata API issue, you cannot install clusters that use bare-metal workers on RHOSP 16.1. Clusters on RHOSP 16.2 are not impacted by this issue. ([**BZ#2033953**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033953))
* The `loadBalancerSourceRanges` attribute is not supported, and is therefore ignored, in load-balancer type services in clusters that run on RHOSP and use the OVN Octavia provider. There is no workaround for this issue. ([**OCPBUGS-2789**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2789))
* After a catalog source update, it takes time for OLM to update the subscription status.
  This can mean that the status of the subscription policy may continue to show as compliant when Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) decides whether remediation is needed.
  As a result the operator specified in the subscription policy does not get upgraded.
  As a workaround, include a `status` field in the `spec` section of the catalog source policy as follows:

  ```
  metadata:
    name: redhat-operators-disconnected
  spec:
    displayName: disconnected-redhat-operators
    image: registry.example.com:5000/disconnected-redhat-operators/disconnected-redhat-operator-index:v4.11
  status:
    connectionState:
      lastObservedState: READY
  ```

  This mitigates the delay for OLM to pull the new index image and get the pod ready, reducing the time between completion of catalog source policy remediation and the update of the subscription status.
  If the issue persists and the subscription policy status update is still late you can apply another `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the same subscription policy, or an identical `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with a different name.
  ([**OCPBUGS-2813**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2813))
* TALM skips remediating a policy if all selected clusters are compliant when the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR is started.
  The update of operators with a modified catalog source policy and a subscription policy in the same `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR does not complete.
  The subscription policy is skipped as it is still compliant until the catalog source change is enforced.
  As a workaround, add the following change to one CR in the `common-subscription` policy, for example:

  ```
  metadata.annotations.upgrade: "1"
  ```

  This makes the policy non-compliant prior to the start of the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR.
  ([**OCPBUGS-2812**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2812))
* On a single-node OpenShift instance, rebooting without draining the node to remove all the running pods can cause issues with workload container recovery.
  After the reboot, the workload restarts before all the device plugins are ready, resulting in resources not being available or the workload running on the wrong NUMA node.
  The workaround is to restart the workload pods when all the device plugins have re-registered themselves during the reboot recovery procedure.
  ([**OCPBUGS-2180**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2180))
* The default `dataset_comparison` is currently `ieee1588`. The recommended dataset\_comparison is `G.8275.x`. It is planned to be fixed in a future version of OpenShift Container Platform. In the short term, you can manually update the ptp configuration to include the recommended `dataset_comparison`.
  ([**OCPBUGS-2336**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2336))
* The default `step_threshold` is 0.0. The recommended `step_threshold` is 2.0. It is planned to be fixed in a future version of OpenShift Container Platform. In the short term, you can manually update the ptp configuration to include the recommended `step_threshold`.
  ([**OCPBUGS-3005**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3005))
* The `BMCEventSubscription` CR fails to create a Redfish subscription for a spoke cluster in an ACM-deployed multi-cluster environment, where the metal3 service is only running on a hub cluster.
  The workaround is to create the subscription by calling the Redfish API directly, for example, by running the following command:

  ```
  curl -X POST -i --insecure -u "<BMC_username>:<BMC_password>" https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
      "Protocol": "Redfish",
      "Context": "any string is valid",
      "Destination": "https://hw-event-proxy-openshift-bare-metal-events.apps.example.com/webhook",
      "EventTypes": ["Alert"]
      }'
  ```

  You should receive a `201 Created` response and a header with `Location: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<sub_id>` that indicates that the Redfish events subscription is successfully created.
  ([**OCPBUGSM-43707**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-43707))
* When using the GitOps ZTP pipeline to install a single-node OpenShift cluster in a disconnected environment, there should be two `CatalogSource` CRs applied in the cluster. One of the `CatalogSource` CRs gets deleted following multiple node reboots. As a workaround, you can change the default names, such as `certified-operators` and `redhat-operators`, of the catalog sources. ([**OCPBUGSM-46245**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46245))
* If an invalid subscription channel is specified in the subscription policy that is used to perform a cluster upgrade, the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager indicates a successful upgrade right after the policy is enforced because the `Subscription` state remains `AtLatestKnown`. ([**OCPBUGSM-43618**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-43618))
* The `SiteConfig` disk partition definition fails when applied to multiple nodes in a cluster. When a `SiteConfig` CR is used to provision a compact cluster, creating a valid `diskPartition` config on multiple nodes fails with a Kustomize plugin error. ([**OCPBUGSM-44403**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44403))
* If secure boot is currently disabled and you try to enable it using ZTP, the cluster installation does not start. When secure boot is enabled through ZTP, the boot options are configured before the virtual CD is attached. Therefore, the first boot from the existing hard disk has the secure boot turned on. The cluster installation gets stuck because the system never boots from the CD. ([**OCPBUGSM-45085**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45085))
* Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), spoke cluster deployments on Dell PowerEdge R640 servers are blocked when the virtual media does not disconnect the ISO in the iDRAC console after writing the image to the disk. As a workaround, disconnect the ISO manually through the Virtual Media tab in the iDRAC console.
  ([**OCPBUGSM-45884**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45884))
* Low-latency applications that rely on high-resolution timers to wake up their threads might experience higher wake up latencies than expected.
  Although the expected wake up latency is under 20us, latencies exceeding this can occasionally be seen when running the cyclictest tool for long durations (24 hours or more).
  Testing has shown that wake up latencies are under 20us for over 99.999999% of the samples.
  ([**RHELPLAN-138733**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-138733))
* A Chapman Beach NIC from Intel must be installed in a bifurcated PCIe slot to ensure that both ports are visible. A limitation also exists in the current devlink tooling in RHEL 8.6 which prevents the configuration of 2 ports in the bifurcated PCIe slot.
  ([**RHELPLAN-142458**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-142458))
* Disabling an SR-IOV VF when a port goes down can cause a 3-4 second delay with Intel NICs.
  ([**RHELPLAN-126931**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-126931))
* When using Intel NICs, IPV6 traffic stops when an SR-IOV VF is assigned an IPV6 address.
  ([**RHELPLAN-137741**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-137741))
* When using VLAN strip offloading, the offload flag (`ol_flag`) is not consistently set correctly with the iavf driver.
  ([**RHELPLAN-141240**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-141240))
* A deadlock can occur if an allocation fails during a configuration change with the ice driver.
  ([**RHELPLAN-130855**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-130855))
* SR-IOV VFs send GARP packets with the wrong MAC address when using Intel NICs.
  ([**RHELPLAN-140971**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-140971))
* When using the GitOps ZTP method of managing clusters and deleting a cluster which has not completed installation, the cleanup of the cluster namespace on the hub cluster might hang indefinitely.
  To complete the namespace deletion, remove the `baremetalhost.metal3.io` finalizer from two CRs in the cluster namespace:

  1. Remove the finalizer from the secret that is pointed to by the BareMetalHost CR `.spec.bmc.credentialsName`.
  2. Remove the finalizer from the `BareMetalHost` CR.
     When these finalizers are removed the namespace termination completes within a few seconds.
     ([**OCPBUGS-3029**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3029))
* The addition of a new feature in OCP 4.12 that enables UDP GRO also causes all veth devices to have one RX queue per available CPU (previously each veth had one queue).
  Those queues are dynamically configured by OVN and there is no synchronization between latency tuning and this queue creation.
  The latency tuning logic monitors the veth NIC creation events and starts configuring the RPS queue cpu masks before all the queues are properly created.
  This means that some of the RPS queue masks are not configured. Since not all NIC queues are configured properly there is a chance of latency spikes in a real-time application that uses timing-sensitive cpus for communicating with services in other containers.
  Applications that do not use kernel networking stack are not affected.
  ([**OCPBUGS-4194**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4194))
* Platform Operator and RukPak known issues:

  + Deleting a platform Operator results in a cascading deletion of the underlying resources. This cascading deletion logic can only delete resources that are defined in the Operator Lifecycle Manager-based (OLM) Operatorâs bundle format. In the case that a platform Operator creates resources that are defined outside of that bundle format, then the platform Operator is responsible for handling this cleanup interaction. This behavior can be observed when installing the cert-manager Operator as a platform Operator, and then removing it. The expected behavior is that a namespace is left behind that the cert-manager Operator created.
  + The platform Operators manager does not have any logic that compares the current and desired state of the cluster-scoped `BundleDeployment` resource it is managing. This leaves the possibility for a user who has sufficient role-based access control (RBAC) to manually modify that underlying `BundleDeployment` resource and can lead to situations where users can escalate their permissions to the `cluster-admin` role. By default, you should limit access to this resource to a small number of users that explicitly require access. The only supported client for the `BundleDeployment` resource during this Technology Preview release is the platform Operators manager component.
  + OLMâs Marketplace component is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled. This has implications during the Technology Preview release because platform Operators are currently only sourced from the `redhat-operators` catalog source that is managed by the Marketplace component. As a workaround, a cluster administrator can create this catalog source manually.
  + The RukPak provisioner implementations do not have the ability to inspect the health or state of the resources that they are managing. This has implications for surfacing the generated `BundleDeployment` resource state to the `PlatformOperator` resource that owns it. If a `registry+v1` bundle contains manifests that can be successfully applied to the cluster, but will fail at runtime, such as a `Deployment` object referencing a non-existent image, the result is a successful status being reflected in individual `PlatformOperator` and `BundleDeployment` resources.
  + Cluster administrators configuring `PlatformOperator` resources before cluster creation cannot easily determine the desired package name without leveraging an existing cluster or relying on documented examples. There is currently no validation logic that ensures an individually configured `PlatformOperator` resource will be able to successfully roll out to the cluster.
* When using the Technology Preview OCI feature with the oc-mirror CLI plugin, the mirrored catalog embeds all of the Operator bundles, instead of filtering only on those specified in the image set configuration file. ([**OCPBUGS-5085**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5085))
* There is currently a known issue when you run the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform Installer to generate an ISO image from a directory where the previous release was used for ISO image generation. An error message is displayed with the release version not matching. As a workaround, create and use a new directory. ([**OCPBUGS#5159**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5159))
* The defined capabilities in the `install-config.yaml` file are not applied in the Agent-based OpenShift Container Platform installation. Currently, there is no workaround. ([**OCPBUGS#5129**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5129))
* Fully populated load balancers on RHOSP that are created with the OVN driver can contain pools that are stuck in a pending creation status. This issue can cause problems for clusters that are deployed on RHOSP. To resolve the issue, update your RHOSP packages. ([**BZ#2042976**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042976))
* Bulk load-balancer member updates on RHOSP can return a 500 code in response to `PUT` requests. This issue can cause problems for clusters that are deployed on RHOSP. To resolve the issue, update your RHOSP packages. ([**BZ#2100135**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100135))
* Clusters that use external cloud providers can fail to retrieve updated credentials after rotation. The following platforms are affected:

  + Alibaba Cloud
  + IBM Cloud VPC
  + IBM Power
  + OpenShift Virtualization
  + RHOSP

  As a workaround, restart `openshift-cloud-controller-manager` pods by running the following command:

  ```
  $ oc delete pods --all -n openshift-cloud-controller-manager
  ```

  ([**OCPBUGS-5036**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5036))
* There is a known issue when `cloud-provider-openstack` tries to create health monitors on OVN load balancers by using the API to create fully populated load balancers. These health monitors become stuck in a `PENDING_CREATE` status. After their deletion, associated load balancers are are stuck in a `PENDING_UPDATE` status. There is no workaround. ([**BZ#2143732**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2143732))
* Due to a known issue, to use stateful IPv6 networks with cluster that run on RHOSP, you must include `ip=dhcp,dhcpv6` in the kernel arguments of [worker nodes](../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.html#nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_nodes-nodes-working). ([**OCPBUGS-2104**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2104))
* It is not possible to create a macvlan on the physical function (PF) when a virtual function (VF) already exists. This issue affects the Intel E810 NIC. ([**BZ#2120585**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2120585))
* There is currently a known issue when manually configuring IPv6 addresses and routes on an IPv4 OpenShift Container Platform cluster. When converting to a dual-stack cluster, newly created pods remain in the `ContainerCreating` status. Currently, there is no workaround. This issue is planned to be addressed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release. ([**OCPBUGS-4411**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4411))
* When an OVN cluster installed on IBM Public Cloud has more than 60 worker nodes, simultaneously creating 2000 or more services and route objects can cause pods created at the same time to remain in the `ContainerCreating` status. If this problem occurs, entering the `oc describe pod <podname>` command shows events with the following warning: `FailedCreatePodSandBoxâ¦âfailed to configure pod interface: timed out waiting for OVS port binding (ovn-installed)`. There is currently no workaround for this issue. ([**OCPBUGS-3470**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3470))
* When a control plane machine is replaced on a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes network provider, the pods related to OVN-Kubernetes might not start on the replacement machine. When this occurs, the lack of networking on the new machine prevents etcd from allowing it to replace the old machine. As a result, the cluster is stuck in this state and might become degraded. This behavior can occur when the control plane is replaced manually or by the control plane machine set.

  There is currently no workaround to resolve this issue if encountered. To avoid this issue, [disable the control plane machine set](../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-disabling.html) and do not replace control plane machines manually if your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network provider. ([**OCPBUGS-5306**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5306))
* If a cluster that was deployed through ZTP has policies that do not become compliant, and no `ClusterGroupUpdates` object is present, you must restart the TALM pods. Restarting TALM creates the proper `ClusterGroupUpdates` object, which enforces the policy compliance. ([**OCPBUGS-4065**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4065))
* Currently, a certificate compliance issue, specifically outputted as `x509: certificate is not standards compliant`, exists when you run the installation program on macOS for the purposes of installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on VMware vSphere. This issue relates to a known issue with the `golang` compiler in that the compiler does not recognize newly supported macOS certificate standards. No workaround exists for this issue. ([**OSDOCS-5694**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSDOCS-5694))
* Currently, when using a persistent volume (PV) that contains a very large number of files, the pod might not start or can take an excessive amount of time to start. For more information, see this [knowledge base article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6221251). ([**BZ1987112**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987112))
* Creating pods with Azure File NFS volumes that are scheduled to the control plane node causes the mount to be denied. ([**OCPBUGS-18581**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18581))

  To work around this issue: If your control plane nodes are schedulable, and the pods can run on worker nodes, use `nodeSelector` or Affinity to schedule the pod in worker nodes.
* When installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster with static IP addressing and Tang encryption, nodes start without network settings. This condition prevents nodes from accessing the Tang server, causing installation to fail. To address this condition, you must set the network settings for each node as `ip` installer arguments.

  1. For installer-provisioned infrastructure, before installation provide the network settings as `ip` installer arguments for each node by executing the following steps.

     1. Create the manifests.
     2. For each node, modify the `BareMetalHost` custom resource with annotations to include the network settings. For example:

        ```
        $ cd ~/clusterconfigs/openshift
        $ vim openshift-worker-0.yaml
        ```

        ```
        apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
        kind: BareMetalHost
        metadata:
          annotations:
            bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/installer-args: '["--append-karg", "ip=<static_ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname_1>:<interface>:none", "--save-partindex", "1", "-n"]'     (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
            inspect.metal3.io: disabled
            bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname: <fqdn> (6)
            bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/role: <role> (7)
          generation: 1
          name: openshift-worker-0
          namespace: mynamespace
        spec:
          automatedCleaningMode: disabled
          bmc:
            address: idrac-virtualmedia://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1 (8)
            credentialsName: bmc-secret-openshift-worker-0
            disableCertificateVerification: true
          bootMACAddress: 94:6D:AE:AB:EE:E8
          bootMode: "UEFI"
          rootDeviceHints:
            deviceName: /dev/sda
        ```

        For the `ip` settings, replace:

        | **1** | `<static_ip>` with the static IP address for the node, for example, `192.168.1.100` |
        | --- | --- |
        | **2** | `<gateway>` with the IP address of your networkâs gateway, for example, `192.168.1.1` |
        | **3** | `<netmask>` with the network mask, for example, `255.255.255.0` |
        | **4** | `<hostname_1>` with the nodeâs hostname, for example, `node1.example.com` |
        | **5** | `<interface>` with the name of the network interface, for example, `eth0` |
        | **6** | `<fqdn>` with the fully qualified domain name of the node |
        | **7** | `<role>` with `worker` or `master` to reflect the nodeâs role |
        | **8** | `<bmc_ip>` with with the BMC IP address and the protocol and path of the BMC, as needed. |
     3. Save the file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory.
     4. Create the cluster.
  2. When installing with the Assisted Installer, before installation modify each nodeâs installer arguments using the API to append the network settings as `ip` installer arguments. For example:

     ```
     $ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/${infra_env_id}/hosts/${host_id}/installer-args \
     -X PATCH \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '
         {
           "args": [
             "--append-karg",
             "ip=<static_ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname_1>:<interface>:none",     (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
             "--save-partindex",
             "1",
             "-n"
           ]
         }
       ' | jq
     ```

     For the previous network settings, replace:

     | **1** | `<static_ip>` with the static IP address for the node, for example, `192.168.1.100` |
     | --- | --- |
     | **2** | `<gateway>` with the IP address of your networkâs gateway, for example, `192.168.1.1` |
     | **3** | `<netmask>` with the network mask, for example, `255.255.255.0` |
     | **4** | `<hostname_1>` with the nodeâs hostname, for example, `node1.example.com` |
     | **5** | `<interface>` with the name of the network interface, for example, `eth0`. |

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, due to a wrong check in the OpenStack cloud provider, the load balancers were populated with External IP addresses when all of the Octavia load balancers were created. This increased the time for the load balancers to be handled. With this update, load balancers are still created sequentially and External IP addresses are populated one-by-one. ([**OCPBUGS-5403**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5403))
* Previously, the `cluster-image-registry-operator` would default to using persistent volume claim (PVC) when it failed to reach Swift. With this update, failure to connect to Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) API or other incidental failures cause the `cluster-image-registry-operator` to retry the probe. During the retry, the default to PVC only occurs if the RHOSP catalog is correctly found, and it does not contain object storage; or alternatively, if RHOSP catalog is there and the current user does not have permission to list containers.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.5 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, in the repositories list, you could see the **PipelineRuns** only when the status was `Succeeded` or `Failed` but not when the status was `Running`. With this fix, when the **PipelineRuns** is triggered, you can see it in the repositories list with the status `Running`. ([**OCPBUGS-6816**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6816))
* Previously, when creating a `Secret`, the **Start Pipeline** model created an invalid JSON value, As a result, the Secret was unusable and the `PipelineRun` could fail. With this fix, the **Start Pipeline** model creates a valid JSON value for the `Secret`. Now, you can create valid Secrets while starting a Pipeline. ([**OCPBUGS-6671**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6671))
* Previously, when a `BindableKinds` resource did not have a status, the web console crashed, fetching and showing the same data in a loop. With this fix, you can set the `BindableKinds` resource status array to `[]`, expecting it to exist without a status field. As a result, the web browser or the application does not crash. ([**OCPBUGS-4072**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4072))
* Previously, the associated webhook `<kn-service-name>-github-webhook-secret` did not delete when deleting a Knative (`kn`) service from OpenShift Container Platform. With this fix, all the associated webhook secrets are deleted. Now, you can create a Knative (`kn`) service with the same name as the deleted one.

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.9 --pullspecs

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, validation was not preventing users from installing a GCP cluster into a shared VPC if they did not enable the Technology Preview feature gate. Therefore, you could install a cluster into a shared VPC without enabling the Technology Preview feature gate. This release added a feature gate validation to 4.12 so you must enable `featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade` to install a GCP cluster into a shared VPC. ([**OCPBUGS-7469**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7469))
* Previously, MTU migration configuration would sometimes be cleaned up before the migration was complete causing the migration to fail. This release ensures that the MTU migration is preserved while migration is in progress so that the migration can complete successfully.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.11 --pullspecs
```

#### Features

##### New flag for the oc-mirror plugin: --max-nested-paths

With this update, you can now use the `--max-nested-paths` flag for the oc-mirror plugin to specify the maximum number of nested paths for destination registries that limit nested paths. The default is `2`.

##### New flag for the oc-mirror plugin: --skip-pruning

With this update, you can now use the `--skip-pruning` flag for the oc-mirror plugin to disable automatic pruning of images from the target mirror registry.

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the `openshift-install agent create cluster-manifests` command required a non-empty list of `imageContentSources` in the `install-config.yaml` file. If no image content sources were supplied, the command generated the error `failed to write asset (Mirror Registries Config) to disk: failed to write file: open .: is a directory`. With this update, the command works whether or not the `imageContentSources` section of `install-config.yaml` file contains anything. ([**OCPBUGS-8384**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8384))
* Previously, the OpenStack Machine API provider had to be restarted so that new cloud credentials were used in the event of a rotation of the OpenStack `clouds.yaml` file. Consequently, the ability of a MachineSet to scale to zero was affected. With this update, cloud credentials are no longer cached and the OpenStack Machine API provider reads the corresponding secret on demand.

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration ignored Kuryrâs maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings when using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) Networking service (neutron) component to create a network for OpenShift services. CNO would create a network in Neutron with the wrong MTU property, and this action could cause incompatibility issues among network components. With this update, the CNO does not ignore the Kuryr MTU setting when creating the network for services. You can then use the network to host OpenShift services.([**OCPBUGS-4896**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4896))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, mirroring from a registry to a disk by using an image set configuration file that specifies several digests of the same image, without tags, caused an error because the oc-mirror plugin added a default tag `latest` to all the images (digests). With this update, the oc-mirror plugin now uses a truncated digest of the image, which eliminantes the error. ([**OCPBUGS-13432**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13432))

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.21 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously on single-node OpenShift, in case of node reboot there was a race condition that could result in admission of application pods requesting devices on the node even if devices were unhealthy or unavailable to be allocated. This resulted in runtime failures when the application tried to access devices. With this update, the resources requested by the pod are only allocated if the device plugin has registered itself to kubelet and healthy devices are present on the node to be allocated.

  If these conditions are not met, the pod can fail at admission with `UnexpectedAdmissionError` error, which is an expected behavior. If the application pod is part of deployments, in case of failure subsequent pods are created and ultimately successfully run when devices are suitable to be allocated.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.22 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, client TLS (mTLS) was configured on an Ingress Controller, and the certificate authority (CA) in the client CA bundle required more than 1MB of certificate revocation list (CRLs) to be downloaded. The CRL `ConfigMap` object size limitations prevented updates from occurring. As a result of the missing CRLs, connections with valid client certificates may have been rejected with the error `unknown ca`. With this update, the CRL `ConfigMap` for each Ingress Controller no longer exists; instead, each router pod directly downloads CRLs, ensuring connections with valid client certificates are no longer rejected. ([**OCPBUGS-14454**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14454))
* Previously, because client TLS (mTLS) was configured on an Ingress Controller, mismatches between the distributing certificate authority (CA) and the issuing CA caused the incorrect certificate revocation list (CRL) to be downloaded. As a result, the incorrect CRL was downloaded instead of the correct CRL, causing connections with valid client certificates to be rejected with the error message `unknown ca`. With this update, downloaded CRLs are now tracked by the CA that distributes them. This ensures that valid client certificates are no longer rejected.

#### Features

#### NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator is generally available

NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator was previously introduced as a Technology Preview in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10. It is now generally available in OpenShift Container Platform version 4.12.24 and later.

The NUMA Resources Operator deploys a NUMA-aware secondary scheduler that makes scheduling decisions for workloads based on a complete picture of available NUMA zones in clusters. This enhanced NUMA-aware scheduling ensures that latency-sensitive workloads are processed in a single NUMA zone for maximum efficiency and performance.

This update adds the following features:

* Fine-tuning of API polling for NUMA resource reports.
* Configuration options at the node group level for the node topology exporter.

|  | NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator is not yet available on single-node OpenShift. |

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Ingress Operator did not include an Amazon Web Services (AWS) permission in its cloud credentials request. This impacted the management of domain name system (DNS) records in the Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) `us-iso-east-1` and the Secret Commercial Cloud Services (SC2S) `us-isob-east-1` AWS Regions. If you installed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a C2S or an SC2S AWS Region, the Ingress Operator failed to publish DNS records for the Route 53 service and you received an error message similar to the following example:

  ```
  The DNS provider failed to ensure the record: failed to find hosted zone for record: failed to get tagged resources: AccessDenied: User: [...] is not authorized to perform: route53:ListTagsForResources on resource: [...]
  ```

  With this update, the Ingress Operatorâs cloud credentials request includes the `route53:ListTagsForResources` permission, so that the Operator can publish DNS records in the C2S and SC2S AWS Regions for the Route 53 service.

#### Bug fix

* Previously, an issue was observed in OpenShift Container Platform with some pods getting stuck in the `terminating` state. This affected the reconciliation loop of the allowlist controller, which resulted in unwanted retries that caused the creation of multiple pods.
  With this update, the allowlist controller only inspects pods that belong to the current daemon set. As a result, retries no longer occur when one or more pods are not ready. ([**OCPBUGS-16019**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16019))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, a non-compliant upstream DNS server that provided a UDP response larger than OpenShift Container Platform specified bufsize of 512 bytes, caused an overflow error in CoreDNS in which a response to a DNS query was not given. With this update, users can configure the `protocolStrategy` field on the `dnses.operator.openshift.io` custom resource to be "TCP". This resolves issues with non-compliant upstream DNS servers. ([**OCPBUGS-15251**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15251))
* Previously, the OpenShift Container Platform Router directed traffic to a route with a weight of `0` when it had only one back end. With this update, the router will not send traffic to routes with a single back end with weight `0`. ([**OCPBUGS-18639**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18639))
* Previously, the cloud credentials used in Manila CSI Driver Operator were cached, resulting in authentication issues if these credentials were rotated. With this update, this issue is resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-18475**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18475))

* Previously, large clusters were slow to attach volumes through `cinder-csi-driver`. With this update, `cinder-csi-driver` is updated with slow volume attachment when the number of Cinder volumes in the project exceed 1000. ([**OCPBUGS-20124**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20124))

#### Feature

##### APIServer.config.openshift.io is now tracked by Insights Operator

After running the Insights Operator, a new file is now available in the archive in the path `config/apiserver.json` with the information about the audit profile for `APIServer.config.openshift.io`.

Access to audit profiles help you to understand what audit policy is common practice, what profiles are most commonly used, what differences there are between industries, and what kind of customization is applied.

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) did not reconcile `SecurityContextConstraints` (SCC) resources as expected. The CVO now properly reconciles the `volumes` field in the `SecurityContextConstraints` resources towards the state defined in the release image. User modifications to system SCC resources are tolerated. For more information about how SCC resources can impact updating, see [Resolving Detected modified SecurityContextConstraints update gate before upgrading to 4.14](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7033949). ([**OCPBUGS-22198**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22198))
* Previously, a large number of `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) resources on startup caused a pod running the Node Tuning Operator (NTO) to restart and loop, which resulted in an error. With this update, the issue is fixed. ([**OCPBUGS-21837**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-21837))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator made API calls to the Storage Account List endpoint as part of obtaining access keys every 5 minutes. In projects with several OpenShift Container Platform clusters, this could lead to API rate limits being reached, which could result in several HTTP errors when attempting to create new clusters. With this release, the time between calls is increased from 5 minutes to 20 minutes. ([**OCPBUGS-22125**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22125))

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.51 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, when the most recent and default channels were selectively mirrored, and a new release introduced a new channel, the current default channel became invalid. This caused the automatic assignment of the new default channel to fail. With this release, you can now define a `defaultChannel` field in the `ImageSetConfig` custom resource (CR) that overrides the `currentDefault` channel. ([**OCPBUGS-29232**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29232))
* Previously, the `compat-openssl10` package was included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). This package did not meet Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) remediation requirements for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). With this release, `compat-openssl10` has been removed from the RHCOS. As a result, security scanners will no longer identify potential common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in this package. Any binary running on the host RHCOS requiring Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) OpenSSL compatibility must be upgraded to support RHEL8 OpenSSL.

$ oc adm release info 4.12.57 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the `clear-irqbalance-banned-cpus.sh` script set an empty value for `IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS` in the `/etc/sysconfig/irqbalance` pod annotation. As a result, the IRQs only balanced over the reserved CPUs. With this release, the `clear-irqbalance-banned-cpus.sh` script sets the banned mask to zeros on startup and the issue has been resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-31442**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31442))
* Previously, a kernel regression introduced in OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.15.0, 4.14.14, 4.13.36, and 4.12.54 led to potential kernel panics in nodes and mounted CephFS volumes. In this release, the regression issue is fixed so that the kernel regression issue no longer occurs. ([**OCPBUGS-33253**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33253))

### RHSA-2024:3349 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.58 bug fix and security update

Issued: 30 May 2024

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.12.58, which includes security updates, is now available. The list of bug fixes that are included in the update is documented in the [RHSA-2024:3349](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3349) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2024:3351](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3351) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.58 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, some container processes created by using the `exec` command persisted even when CRI-O stopped the container. Consequently, lingering processes led to tracking issues, causing process leaks and defunct statuses. With this release, CRI-O tracks the `exec` calls processed for a container and ensures that the processes created as part of the `exec` calls are terminated when the container is stopped. ([**OCPBUGS-33175**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33175))
* Previously, an issue with NodePort traffic-forwarding caused the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic to be directed to pods under a terminating state. With this release, the endpoints selection logic fully implements `KEP-1669 ProxyTerminatingEndpoints` and the issue has been resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-33422**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33422))
* Previously, the load balancing algorithm did not differentiate between active and inactive services when determining weights, and it employed the `random` algorithm excessively in environments with many inactive services or environments routing backends with weight 0. This led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, changes are made to optimize traffic direction towards active services only and prevent unnecessary use of the `random` algorithm with higher weights, reducing the potential for excessive memory consumption. ([**OCPBUGS-33517**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33517))
* Previously, the load-balancing algorithm had flaws that led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, the service filtering logic for load-balancing is updated and the issue has been resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-33778**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33778))

#### Known issue

* Sometimes, the Console Operator status can get stuck in a failed state when the Operator is removed. To work around this issue, patch the Console controller to reset all conditions to the default state when the Console Operator is removed. For example, log in to the cluster and run the following command:

  ```
  $ oc patch console.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type='merge' -p='{"status":{"conditions":null}}'
  ```

### RHSA-2024:3713 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.59 bug fix and security update

Issued: 12 June 2024

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.12.59, which includes security updates, is now available. The list of bug fixes that are included in the update is documented in the [RHSA-2024:3713](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3713) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2024:3715](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3715) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.59 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Ingress Operator would specify the `spec.template.spec.hostNetwork: true` on a router deployment without specifying the `spec.template.spec.containers[].ports[].hostPort`. This caused the API server to set a default value for each filed portâs `hostPort`, which the Ingress Operator would then detect as an external update and attempt to revert it. Now, the Ingress Operator no longer incorrectly performs these updates. ([**OCPBUGS-34888**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34888))
* Previously, the Ingress Operator was leaving the `spec.internalTrafficPolicy`, `spec.ipFamilies`, and `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` fields unspecified for `NodePort` and `ClusterIP` type services. The API would then set default values for these fields, which the Ingress Operator would try to revert. With this update, the Ingress Operator specifies an initial value and fixes the error caused by API default values. ([**OCPBUGS-34757**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34757))
* Previously, if you configured an OpenShift Container Platform cluster with a high number of internal services or user-managed load balancer IP addresses, you experienced a delayed startup time for the OVN-Kubernetes service. This delay occurred when the OVN-Kubernetes service attempted to install `iptables` rules on a node. With this release, the OVN-Kubernetes service can process a large number of services in a few seconds. Additionally, you can access a new log to view the status of installing `iptables` rules on a node. ([**OCPBUGS-34273**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34273))
* Previously, the Ingress Operator did not specify `ingressClass.spec.parameters.scope`, while the Ingress Class API object specifies type `cluster` by default. This caused unnecessary updates to all Ingress Classes when the Operator starts. With this update, the Ingress Operator specifies `ingressClass.spec.parameters.scope` of type `cluster`. ([**OCPBUGS-34110**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34110))

### RHSA-2024:4006 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.12.60 bug fix and security update

Issued: 27 June 2024

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.12.60, which includes security updates, is now available. The list of bug fixes that are included in the update is documented in the [RHSA-2024:4006](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4006) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2024:4008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4008) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.60 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, for the `cluster:capacity_cpu_cores:sum` metric, nodes with the`infra` role but not `master` role were not assigned a value of `infra` for the `label_node_role_kubernetes_io` label. With this update, nodes with the `infra` role but not `master` role are now correctly labeled as `infra` for this metric. ([**OCPBUGS-35558**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35558))
* Previously, when an Ingress Controller was configured with client SSL/TLS, but did not have the `clientca-configmap` finalizer, the Ingress Operator would try to add the finalizer without checking whether the Ingress Controller was marked for deletion. Consequently, if an Ingress Controller was configured with client SSL/TLS and was subsequently deleted, the Operator would correctly remove the finalizer. It would then repeatedly try and fail to update the IngressController to add the finalizer back, resulting in error messages in the Operatorâs logs.

  With this update, the Ingress Operator does not add the `clientca-configmap` finalizer to an Ingress Controller that is marked for deletion. As a result, the Ingress Operator does not attempt incorrect updates and does not log the associated errors. ([**OCPBUGS-35027**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35027))
* Previously, timeout values larger than what Golang could parse were not properly validated. Consequently, timeout values larger than what HAProxy could parse caused issues with HAProxy. With this update, if the timeout specifies a value larger than what can be parsed, the value is capped at the maximum value that HAProxy can parse. As a result, issues are no longer caused by HAProxy. ([**OCPBUGS-33432**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33432))

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.61 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the `mapi_instance_create_failed` alert metric did not fire when there was an error for the Accelerated Networking feature on Microsoft Azure clusters. This release adds the missing alert so that clusters with Accelerated Networking enabled generate alerts when required. ([**OCPBUGS-5235**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5235))
* Previously, the `wait-for-ceo` command that is used during the bootstrap operation to verify etcd rollout did not report errors for some failure modes. With this release, a code fix ensures that error messages for these failure modes get reported. ([**OCPBUGS-35501**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35501))
* Previously, the Helm Plugin index view did not display the same number of charts as the Helm CLI if the chart names varied. With this release, the Helm catalog now looks for `charts.openshift.io/name` and `charts.openshift.io/provider` so that all versions are grouped together in a single catalog title. ([**OCPBUGS-34933**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34933))

#### Enhancements

* Previously, the installation program failed to install a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC on the "eu-es" region, although it is supported. With this update, the installation program successfully installs a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC on the "eu-es" region. ([**OCPBUGS-22981**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22981))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, when the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) evaluated a potential upgrade, the Operator used the dynamic client list for all custom resource (CR) instances in the cluster. Clusters with a large number of CRs could experience timeouts from the `apiserver` and stranded upgrades. With this release, the issue is resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-42161**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42161))
* Previously, the proxy service for the web console plugin handled non-200 response codes as error responses. This, in turn, caused browser caching issues. With this release, the proxy service is fixed so that it does not handle these responses as errors. ([**OCPBUGS-41600**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41600))

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.12.68 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, an upstream change in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) caused the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to degrade. With this release, the CCO is no longer degraded, and the issue is resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-43872**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43872))
* Previously, when updating to OpenShift Container Platform version 4.14, HAProxy 2.6 enforced strict RFC 7230 compliance and rejected requests with multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers. Duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` headers were configured at the application level, so the requests resulted in `502 Bad Gateway` errors and service disruptions. With this release, cluster administrators can use a procedure to proactively detect applications that would send duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` headers before updating their clusters. This allows administrators to mitigate the issue in advance and prevents service disruption. ([**OCPBUGS-43703**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43703))
* Previously, a group ID was not added to the `/etc/group` within the container when the `spec.securityContext.runAsGroup` attribute was set in the pod resource. With this release, this issue is resolved. ([**OCPBUGS-41248**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41248))
* Previously, stale data prevented the node of an updated, OVN-enabled cluster from rejoining the cluster and returning to the `Ready` state. This fix removes problematic stale data from older versions of OpenShift Container Platform and resolves the issue. ([**OCPBUGS-38382**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38382))
* Previously, when opening a targeted link in a new tab, an error displayed the following message: `Cannot read properties of undefined`. This issue was the result of a missing object validation check. With this release, the object validation check is added, and the new tab of the target detail displays correctly. ([**OCPBUGS-33519**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33519))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. Thatâs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who donât and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the worldâs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilotâs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot âcopy/pasteâ?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilotâs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not âcopying and pastingâ from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editorâfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHubâs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHubâs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHubâs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those featuresâ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilotâs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Hereâs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:Â  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilotâs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHubâs public repositoriesâwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHubâs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHubâs AI model. Again, Copilot does not âlook upâ or âcopy and pasteâ code, but is instead using context from a userâs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilotâs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If thereâs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositoriesâincluding ones without licensesâthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We donât determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered âfunctionalâ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years weâve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. Itâs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called âCopilotâ not âAutopilotâ and itâs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilotâs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses â rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. â you should continue these policies with Copilotâs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilotâs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* Youâre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilotâs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilotâs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot âcopy/pasteâ?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilotâs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not âcopying and pastingâ from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editorâfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It alsoÂ  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with CopilotÂ  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organizationâs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customerâs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHubâs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHubâs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHubâs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those featuresâ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilotâs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Hereâs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:Â  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilotâs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHubâs public repositoriesâwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHubâs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHubâs AI model. Again, Copilot does not âlook upâ or âcopy and pasteâ code, but is instead using context from a userâs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilotâs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If thereâs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositoriesâincluding ones without licensesâthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We donât determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered âfunctionalâ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years weâve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. Itâs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called âCopilotâ not âAutopilotâ and itâs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilotâs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses â rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. â you should continue these policies with Copilotâs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilotâs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* Youâre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilotâs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilotâs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2211322#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2023-05-31 06:02:16 UTC  ``` A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to launch containers using images that are restricted by ImagePolicyWebhook  when using ephemeral containers. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin is used together with ephemeral  containers.  This issue affects kube-apiserver. Clusters are impacted by this vulnerability if:    1. The ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin is used to restrict the use of certain images and     2. Pods using ephemeral containers.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2211322#c3)  Avinash Hanwate    2023-06-15 05:43:50 UTC  ``` Created golang-k8s-kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2215200](show_bug.cgi?id=2215200 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-2727 golang-k8s-kubernetes: kube-apiserver: Bypassing policies imposed by the ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin [fedora-all]")]   Created origin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2215202](show_bug.cgi?id=2215202 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-2727 origin: kube-apiserver: Bypassing policies imposed by the ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2211322#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-31 14:20:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14  Via RHSA-2023:5008 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5008)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2184481#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-04-04 20:21:00 UTC  ``` Templates did not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and as such did not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contained a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action could be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template.  References:  <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/59234> <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/59272>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2184481#c9)  Avinash Hanwate    2023-04-24 04:54:33 UTC  ```

This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2023-07-20 22:43:08 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2176267#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-03-07 20:19:01 UTC  ``` ''' We've discovered a privilege escalation issue in the OpenShift platform.  Conditions for the privilege escalation: - a user must be granted the ability to "update, patch" the  "pods/ephemeralcontainers" subresource  Â Â Â  - by default, NEITHER common users NOR Service Accounts are granted  this permission by the platform - with the above permission, a user is able to patch a running pod  they've got access to and bypass SCC admission  Â Â Â  - this means, a user can create a "privileged" container, which  allows them obtaining access to the pod's node resources  The step-by-step reproducer is described in  <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7181>.  Affected OpenShift Container Platform versions: 4.10 and newer. Affected component: kube-apiserver (and the platforms that use it)  The bug is located within the apiserver-library-go repository in the  following module:  <https://github.com/openshift/apiserver-library-go/tree/master/pkg/securitycontextconstraints>.  We are yet to determine how to fix it.  The workaround is to remove the permissions to "update, patch" the  "pods/ephemeralcontainers" subresource from any low-privileged users, if  there are any that currently hold it.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

## Package

## Affected versions

< 0.0.0-20230621

## Patched versions

0.0.0-20230621

## Description

An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in kube-apiserver. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions "update, patch" the "pods/ephemeralcontainers" subresource beyond what the default is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform 4.12.24. See the following advisory for the RPM packages for this
release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3976](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A3976)

Space precludes documenting all of the container images in this advisory.
See the following Release Notes documentation, which will be updated

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of Ã¢ÂÂkeyÃ¢ÂÂ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

OpenShift Container Platform enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

## About this release

OpenShift Container Platform ([RHSA-2022:0056](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0056)) is now available. This release uses [Kubernetes 1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 are included in this topic.

Red Hat did not publicly release OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.3 as the GA version.

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 clusters are available at <https://console.redhat.com/openshift>. The Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for OpenShift Container Platform allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.4â8.8, as well as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.10.

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines.

## OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of OpenShift Container Platform changes independently of the OpenShift Container Platform version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift).

## New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

### Documentation

#### Getting started with OpenShift Container Platform

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 now includes a getting started guide. Getting Started with OpenShift Container Platform defines basic terminology and provides role-based next steps for developers and administrators.

The tutorials walk new users through the web console and the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) interfaces. New users can accomplish the following tasks through the Getting Started:

* Create a project
* Grant view permissions
* Deploy a container image from Quay
* Examine and scale an application
* Deploy a Python application from GitHub
* Connect to a database from Quay
* Create a secret
* Load and view your application

For more information, see [Getting Started with OpenShift Container Platform](../getting_started/openshift-overview.html).

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

#### Improved customization of bare metal RHCOS installation

The `coreos-installer` utility now has `iso customize` and `pxe customize` subcommands for more flexible customization when installing RHCOS on bare metal from the live ISO and PXE images.

This includes the ability to customize the installation to fetch Ignition configs from HTTPS servers that use a custom certificate authority or self-signed certificate.

#### RHCOS now uses RHEL 8.4

RHCOS now uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.4 packages in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10. These packages provide you the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, such as NetworkManager features, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates.

### Installation and upgrade

#### New default component types for AWS installations

The OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 installer uses new default component types for installations on AWS. The installation program uses the following components by default:

* AWS EC2 M6i instances for both control plane and compute nodes, where available
* AWS EBS gp3 storage

#### Enhancements to API in the `install-config.yaml` file

Previously, when a user installed OpenShift Container Platform on a bare metal installer-provisioned infrastructure, they had nowhere to configure custom network interfaces, such as static IPs or vLANs to communicate with the Ironic server.

When configuring a Day 1 installation on bare metal only, users can now use the API in the `install-config.yaml` file to customize the network configuration (`networkConfig`). This configuration is set during the installation and provisioning process and includes advanced options, such as setting static IPs per host.

#### OpenShift Container Platform on ARM

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 is now supported on ARM based AWS EC2 and bare-metal platforms. Instance availability and installation documentation can be found in [Supported installation methods for different platforms](../installing/installing-preparing.html#supported-installation-methods-for-different-platforms).

The following features are supported for OpenShift Container Platform on ARM:

* OpenShift Cluster Monitoring
* RHEL 8 Application Streams
* OVNKube
* Elastic Block Store (EBS) for AWS
* AWS .NET applications
* NFS storage on bare metal

The following Operators are supported for OpenShift Container Platform on ARM:

* Node Tuning Operator
* Node Feature Discovery Operator
* Cluster Samples Operator
* Cluster Logging Operator
* Elasticsearch Operator
* Service Binding Operator

#### Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces support for installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure in Technology Preview.

The following limitations apply for IBM Cloud using IPI:

* Deploying IBM Cloud using IPI on a previously existing network is not supported.
* The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can use only Manual mode. Mint mode or STS are not supported.
* IBM Cloud DNS Services is not supported. An instance of IBM Cloud Internet Services is required.
* Private or disconnected deployments are not supported.

For more information, see [Preparing to install on IBM Cloud](../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.html#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud).

#### Thin provisioning support for VMware vSphere cluster installation

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces support for thin-provisioned disks when you install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. You can provision disks as `thin`, `thick`, or `eagerZeroedThick`. For more information about disk provisioning modes in VMware vSphere, see [Installation configuration parameters](../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations).

#### Installing a cluster into an Amazon Web Services GovCloud region

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are now available for AWS GovCloud regions. The availability of these AMIs improves the installation process because you are no longer required to upload a custom RHCOS AMI to deploy a cluster.

For more information, see [Installing a cluster on AWS into a government region](../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-government-region.html#installing-aws-government-region).

#### Using a custom AWS IAM role for instance profiles

Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, if you configure a cluster with an existing IAM role, the installation program no longer adds the `shared` tag to the role when deploying the cluster. This enhancement improves the installation process for organizations that want to use a custom IAM role, but whose security policies prevent the use of the `shared` tag.

#### CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters

To install a CSI driver on a cluster running on vSphere, you must have the following components installed:

* Virtual hardware version 15 or later
* vSphere version 6.7 Update 3 or later
* VMware ESXi version 6.7 Update 3 or later

Components with versions earlier than those above are still supported, but are deprecated. These versions are still fully supported, but version 4.11 of OpenShift Container Platform will require vSphere virtual hardware version 15 or later.

|  | If your cluster is deployed on vSphere, and the preceding components are lower than the version mentioned above, upgrading from OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 to 4.10 on vSphere is supported, but no vSphere CSI driver will be installed. Bug fixes and other upgrades to 4.10 are still supported, however upgrading to 4.11 will be unavailable. |
| --- | --- |

#### Installing a cluster on Alibaba Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces the ability for installing a cluster on Alibaba Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure in Technology Preview. This type of installation lets you use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains.

#### Installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub using installer-provisioned infrastructure

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces support for installing a cluster on Azure Stack Hub using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This type of installation lets you use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains.

|  | Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.14, you can deploy control plane and compute nodes with the `premium_LRS`, `standardSSD_LRS`, or `standard_LRS` disk type. By default, the installation program deploys control plane and compute nodes with the `premium_LRS` disk type. In earlier 4.10 releases, only the `standard_LRS` disk type was supported. |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Installing a cluster on Azure Stack Hub with an installer-provisioned infrastructure](../installing/installing_azure_stack_hub/installing-azure-stack-hub-default.html#installing-azure-stack-hub-default).

#### Conditional updates

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see [Conditional updates](../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.html#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases) and [Updating along a conditional upgrade path](../updating/updating-cluster-cli.html#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli).

#### Disconnected mirroring with the oc-mirror CLI plugin (Technology Preview)

This release introduces the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin as a Technology Preview. You can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror images in a disconnected environment.

For more information, see [Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin](../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.html#installing-mirroring-disconnected).

#### Installing a cluster on RHOSP that uses OVS-DPDK

You can now install a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) for which compute machines run on Open vSwitch with the Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK) networks. Workloads that run on these machines can benefit from the performance and latency improvements of OVS-DPDK.

For more information, see [Installing a cluster on RHOSP that supports DPDK-connected compute machines](../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-ovs-dpdk.html#installing-openstack-installer-ovs-dpdk).

#### Setting compute machine affinity during installation on RHOSP

You can now select compute machine affinity when you install a cluster on RHOSP. By default, compute machines are deployed with a `soft-anti-affinity` server policy, but you can also choose `anti-affinity` or `soft-affinity` policies.

### Web console

#### Developer perspective

* With this update, you can specify the name of a service binding connector in the **Topology** view while making a binding connection.
* With this update, creating pipelines workflow has now been enhanced:

  + You can now choose a user-defined pipeline from a drop-down list while importing your application from the **Import from Git** pipeline workflow.
  + Default webhooks are added for the pipelines that are created using **Import from Git** workflow and the URL is visible in the side panel of the selected resources in the **Topology** view.
  + You can now opt out of the default Tekton Hub integration by setting the parameter `enable-devconsole-integration` to `false` in the `TektonConfig` custom resource.

    Example `TektonConfig` CR to opt out of Tekton Hub integration
    ```
    ...
    hub:
      params:
        - name: enable-devconsole-integration
          value: 'false'
    ...
    ```
  + **Pipeline builder** contains the Tekton Hub tasks that are supported by the cluster, all other unsupported tasks are excluded from the list.
* With this update, the application export workflow now displays the export logs dialog or alert while the export is in progress. You can use the dialog to cancel or restart the exporting process.
* With this update, you can add your new Helm Chart Repository to the **Developer Catalog** by creating a custom resource. Refer to the quick start guides in the **Developer** perspective to add a new **ProjectHelmChartRepository**.
* With this update, you can now access [community devfiles samples](http://registry.devfile.io/) using the **Developer Catalog**.

#### Dynamic plugin (Technology Preview)

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, the ability to create OpenShift console dynamic plugins is now available as a Technology Preview feature. You can use this feature to customize your interface at runtime in many ways, including:

* Adding custom pages
* Adding perspectives and updating navigation items
* Adding tabs and actions to resource pages

For more information about the dynamic plugin, see [Adding a dynamic plugin to the OpenShift Container Platform web console](../web_console/dynamic-plugins.html#dynamic-plugins_dynamic-plugins).

#### Running a pod in debug mode

With this update, you can now view debug terminals in the web console. When a pod has a container that is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, a debug pod can be launched. A terminal interface is displayed and can be used to debug the crash looping container.

* This feature can be accessed by the pod status pop-up window, which is accessed by clicking on the status of a pod, provides links to debug terminals for each crash looping container within that pod.
* You can also access this feature on the **Logs** tab of the pod details page. A debug terminal link is displayed above the log window when a crash looping container is selected.

Additionally, the pod status pop-up window now provides links to the **Logs** and **Events** tabs of the pod details page.

#### Customized workload notifications

With this update, you can customize workload notifications on the **User Preferences** page. **User workload notifications** under the **Notifications** tab allows you to hide user workload notifications that appear on the **Cluster Overview** page or in your drawer.

#### Improved quota visibility

With this update, non-admin users are now able to view their usage of the `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` on the **Project Overview**, **ResourceQuotas**, and **API Explorer** pages to determine the cluster-scoped quota available for use. Additionally, `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` details can now be found on the **Search** page.

#### Cluster support level

OpenShift Container Platform now enables you to view support level information about your cluster on the **Overview** â **Details** card, in the **Cluster Settings**, in the **About** modal, and adds a notification to your notifications drawer when your cluster is unsupported. From the **Overview** page, you can manage subscription settings under the **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**.

### Security and compliance

Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for security and compliance components can be found in the [Compliance Operator](../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-release-notes.html) and [File Integrity Operator](../security/file_integrity_operator/file-integrity-operator-release-notes.html) release notes.

For more information about security and compliance, see [OpenShift Container Platform security and compliance](../security/index.html).

### Networking

#### Dual-stack services require that ipFamilyPolicy is specified

When you create a service that uses multiple IP address families, you must explicitly specify `ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack` or `ipFamilyPolicy: RequireDualStack` in your Service object definition. This change breaks backward compatibility with earlier releases of OpenShift Container Platform.

For more information, see [BZ#2045576](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2045576).

#### Change cluster network MTU after cluster installation

After cluster installation, if you are using the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider or the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, you can change your hardware MTU and your cluster network MTU values. Changing the MTU across the cluster is disruptive and requires that each node is rebooted several times. For more information, see [Changing the cluster network MTU](../networking/changing-cluster-network-mtu.html#changing-cluster-network-mtu).

#### OVN-Kubernetes support for gateway configuration

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider adds support for configuring how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and traffic is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement adds a `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field.
With this update, the field can be set at runtime as a post-installation activity and when it is set to `true`, egress traffic is sent from pods to the host networking stack.
This update benefits highly specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
With this update, when the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

|  | To set egress traffic, use `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` and delete the `gateway-mode-config` config map if you have set it up in the `openshift-network-operator` namespace. For more information regarding the `gateway-mode-config` solution and setting OVN-Kubernetes gateway mode in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and higher, see the [soultion](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7008996). |
| --- | --- |

For configuration information, see [Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI cluster network provider](../networking/cluster-network-operator.html#nw-operator-configuration-parameters-for-ovn-sdn_cluster-network-operator).

#### Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`
* `ovn_controller_flow_installation`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_run`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_update`
* `ovn_controller_integration_bridge_openflow_total`
* `ovn_controller_ofctrl_seqno_run`
* `ovn_controller_patch_run`
* `ovn_controller_pinctrl_run`
* `ovnkube_master_ipsec_enabled`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewalls`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_ips`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_first_seen_lsp_created_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_lsp_created_port_binding_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_chassis_port_binding_up_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_port_binding_chassis_duration_seconds`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewalls`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_ips`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

#### Switching between YAML view and a web console form

* Previously, changes were not retained when switching between **YAML view** and **Form view** on the web console. Additionally, after switching to **YAML view**, you could not return to **Form view**. With this update, you can now easily switch between **YAML view** and **Form view** on the web console without losing changes.

#### Listing pods targeted by network policies

When using the network policy functionality in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, the pods affected by a policy are listed. The list changes as the combined namespace and pod selectors in these policy sections are modified:

* Peer definition
* Rule definition
* Ingress
* Egress

The list of impacted pods includes only those pods accessible by the user.

#### Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.

Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see [Network trace methods](../support/gathering-cluster-data.html#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data) and [Collecting a host network trace](../support/gathering-cluster-data.html#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data).

#### Pod-level bonding for secondary networks

Bonding at the pod level is vital to enable workloads inside pods that require high availability and more throughput. With pod-level bonding, you can create a bond interface from multiple single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function interfaces in kernel mode interface. The SR-IOV virtual functions are passed into the pod and attached to a kernel driver.

Scenarios where pod-level bonding is required include creating a bond interface from multiple SR-IOV virtual functions on different physical functions. Creating a bond interface from two different physical functions on the host can be used to achieve high availability at pod level.

#### Egress IP address support for clusters installed on public clouds

As a cluster administrator, you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace. An egress IP address ensures that a consistent source IP address is associated with traffic from a particular namespace that is leaving the cluster.

For the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network providers, you can configure an egress IP address on the following public cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure

To learn more, refer to the respective documentation for your cluster network provider:

#### OpenShift SDN cluster network provider network policy support for egress policies and ipBlock except

If you use the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, you can now use egress rules in network policy with `ipBlock` and `ipBlock.except`. You define egress policies in the `egress` array of the `NetworkPolicy` object.

For more information, refer to [About network policy](../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html#about-network-policy).

#### Ingress Controller router compression

This enhancement adds the ability to configure global HTTP traffic compression on the HAProxy Ingress Controller for specific MIME types. This update enables gzip-compression of your ingress workloads when there are large amounts of compressible routed traffic.

For more information, see [Using router compression](../networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-configuring-router-compression_configuring-ingress).

#### Support for CoreDNS customization

A cluster administrator can now configure DNS servers to allow DNS name resolution through the configured servers for the default domain. A DNS forwarding configuration can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.

For more information, see [Using DNS forwarding](../networking/dns-operator.html#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator).

#### Support for CoreDNS log level and Operator log level

This enhancement adds the ability to manually change the log level for an Operator individually or a cluster as a whole.

For more information, see [Setting the CoreDNS log level](../networking/dns-operator.html#nw-dns-loglevel_dns-operator)

#### Support for configuring the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller

You can now set the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller to any value between 480 and 4096 bytes.

For more information, see [Ingress Controller configuration parameters](../networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress).

#### Set CoreDNS forwarding policy

You can now set the CoreDNS forwarding policy through the DNS Operator. The default value is `Random`, and you can also set the value to `RoundRobin` or `Sequential`.

For more information, see [Using DNS forwarding](../networking/dns-operator.html#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator).

#### Open vSwitch hardware offloading support for SR-IOV

You can now configure Open vSwitch hardware offloading to increase data processing performance on compatible bare metal nodes.
Hardware offloading is a method for processing data that removes data processing tasks from the CPU and transfers them to the dedicated data processing unit of a network interface controller.
Benefits of this feature include faster data processing, reduced CPU workloads, and lower computing costs.

For more information, see [Configuring hardware offloading](../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-hardware-offloading.html#about-hardware-offloading_hardware-offloading).

#### Creating DNS records by using the Red Hat External DNS Operator (Technology Preview)

You can now create DNS records by using the Red Hat External DNS Operator on cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. You can install the External DNS Operator using OperatorHub. You can use parameters to configure `ExternalDNS` as required.

For more information, see [Understanding the External DNS Operator](../networking/external_dns_operator/understanding-external-dns-operator.html#understanding-external-dns-operator).

#### Mutable Ingress Controller endpoint publishing strategy enhancement

Cluster administrators can now configure the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing strategy to change the load-balancer scope between `Internal` and `External` in OpenShift Container Platform.

For more information, see [Ingress Controller endpoint publishing strategy](../networking/nw-ingress-controller-endpoint-publishing-strategies.html#nw-ingress-controller-endpoint-publishing-strategies_nw-ingress-controller-endpoint-publishing-strategies).

#### OVS hardware offloading for clusters on RHOSP (Technology Preview)

For clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), you can enable Open vSwitch (OVS) hardware offloading.

For more information, see [Enabling OVS hardware offloading](../post_installation_configuration/network-configuration.html#nw-osp-enabling-ovs-offload_post-install-network-configuration).

#### Reduction of RHOSP resources created by Kuryr

For clusters that run on RHOSP, Kuryr now only creates Neutron networks and subnets for namespaces that have at least one pod on the pods network. Additionally, pools in a namespace are populated after at least one pod on the pods network is created in the namespace.

#### Support for RHOSP DCN (Technology Preview)

You can now deploy a cluster on a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) deployment that uses a [distributed compute node (DCN)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/distributed_compute_node_and_storage_deployment/index) configuration. This deployment configuration has several limitations:

* Only RHOSP version 16 is supported.
* For RHOSP 16.1.4, only hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) and Ceph technologies are supported at the edge.
* For RHOSP 16.2, non-HCI and Ceph technologies are supported as well.
* Networks must be created ahead of time (Bring Your Own Network) as either tenant or provider networks. These networks must be scheduled in the appropriate availability zones.

#### Support for external cloud providers for clusters on RHOSP (Technology Preview)

Clusters that run on RHOSP can now use [Cloud Provider OpenStack](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack). This capability is available as part of the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set.

#### Configuring host network interfaces with NMState on installer-provisioned clusters

OpenShift Container Platform now provides a `networkConfig` configuration setting for installer-provisioned clusters, which takes an NMState YAML configuration to configure host interfaces. During installer-provisioned installations, you can add the `networkConfig` configuration setting and the NMState YAML configuration to the `install-config.yaml` file. Additionally, you can add the `networkConfig` configuration setting and the NMState YAML configuration to the bare metal host resource when using the Bare Metal Operator.

The most common use case for the `networkConfig` configuration setting is to set static IP addresses on a hostâs network interface during installation or while expanding the cluster.

For more information, see [Configuring host network interfaces in the install-config.yaml file](../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.html#configuring-host-network-interfaces-in-the-install-config-yaml-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow).

#### Boundary clock and PTP enhancements to linuxptp services

You can now specify multiple network interfaces in a `PtpConfig` profile to allow nodes running RAN vDU applications to serve as a Precision Time Protocol Telecom Boundary Clock (PTP T-BC). Interfaces configured as boundary clocks now also support PTP fast events.

For more information, see [Configuring linuxptp services as boundary clock](../networking/using-ptp.html#configuring-linuxptp-services-as-boundary-clock_using-ptp).

#### Support for Intel 800-Series Columbiaville NICs

Intel 800-Series Columbiaville NICs are now fully supported for interfaces configured as boundary clocks or ordinary clocks. Columbiaville NICs are supported in the following configurations:

* Ordinary clock
* Boundary clock synced to the Grandmaster clock
* Boundary clock with one port synchronizing from an upstream source clock, and three ports providing downstream timing to destination clocks

For more information, see [Configuring PTP devices](../networking/using-ptp.html#configuring-ptp-devices).

#### Kubernetes NMState Operator is GA for bare-metal, IBM Power, IBM Z, and LinuxONE installations

OpenShift Container Platform now provides the Kubernetes NMState Operator for bare-metal, IBM Power, IBM Z, and LinuxONE installations. The Kubernetes NMState Operator is still a Technology Preview for all other platforms. See [About the Kubernetes NMState Operator](../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.html) for additional details.

#### SR-IOV support for Mellanox MT2892 cards

SR-IOV support is now available for [Mellanox MT2892 cards](../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov).

#### Network Observability Operator to observe network traffic flow

As an administrator, you can now install the Network Observability Operator to observe the network traffic for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster in the console. You can view and monitor the network traffic data in different graphical representations. The Network Observability Operator uses eBPF technology to create the network flows. The network flows are enriched with OpenShift Container Platform information, and stored in Loki. You can use the network traffic information for detailed troubleshooting and analysis.

The Network Observability Operator is General Availability (GA) status in the 4.12 release of OpenShift Container Platform and is also supported in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [Network Observability](../networking/network_observability/network-observability-overview.html#network-observability-overview).

##### Network Observability Operator updates

The Network Observability Operator releases updates independently from the OpenShift Container Platform minor version release stream. Updates are available through a single, rolling stream which is supported on all currently supported versions of OpenShift Container Platform 4. Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the Network Observability Operator can be found in the [Network Observability release notes](../networking/network_observability/network-observability-operator-release-notes.html).

### Hardware

#### Enhancements to MetalLB load balancing

The following enhancements to MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator are included in this release:

* Support for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is added.
* Support for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in combination with BGP is added.
* Support for IPv6 and dual-stack networking is added.
* Support for specifying a node selector on the `speaker` pods is added. You can now control which nodes are used for advertising load balancer service IP addresses. This enhancement applies to layer 2 mode and BGP mode.
* Validating web hooks are added to ensure that address pool and BGP peer custom resources are valid.
* The `v1alpha1` API version for the `AddressPool` and `MetalLB` custom resource definitions that were introduced in the 4.9 release are deprecated. Both custom resources are updated to the `v1beta1` API version.
* Support for speaker pod tolerations in the MetalLB custom resource definition is added.

For more information, see [About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator](../networking/metallb/about-metallb.html#about-metallb).

#### Support for modifying host firmware settings

OpenShift Container Platform supports the `HostFirmwareSettings` and `FirmwareSchema` resources. When deploying OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal hosts, there are times when you need to make changes to the host either before or after provisioning. This can include inspecting the hostâs firmware and BIOS details. There are two new resources that you can use with the Bare Metal Operator (BMO):

* `HostFirmwareSettings`: You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to retrieve and manage the BIOS settings for a host. The resource contains the complete BIOS configuration returned from the baseboard management controller (BMC). Whereas, the firmware field in the `BareMetalHost` resource returns three vendor-independent fields, the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource typically comprises many BIOS settings of vendor-specific fields per host model.
* `FirmwareSchema`: You can use the `FirmwareSchema` to identify the hostâs modifiable BIOS values and limits when making changes to host firmware settings.

See [Bare metal configuration](../post_installation_configuration/bare-metal-configuration.html#post-install-bare-metal-configuration) for additional details.

### Storage

#### Storage metrics indicator

* With this update, workloads can securely share `Secrets` and `ConfigMap` objects across namespaces using inline ephemeral `csi` volumes provided by the Shared Resource CSI Driver. Container Storage Interface (CSI) volumes and the Shared Resource CSI Driver are Technology Preview features. ([BUILD-293](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/BUILD-293))

#### Console Storage Plugin enhancement

* A new feature has been added to the Console Storage Plugin that adds Aria labels throughout the installation flow for screen readers. This provides better accessibility for users that use screen readers to access the console.
* A new feature has been added that provides metrics indicating the amount of used space on volumes used for persistent volume claims (PVCs). This information appears in the PVC list, and in the PVC details in the **Used** column. ([**BZ#1985965**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985965))

#### Persistent storage using the Alibaba AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AliCloud Disk. The AliCloud Disk Driver Operator that manages this driver is generally available, and enabled by default in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-alicloud-disk.html#persistent-storage-csi-alicloud-disk).

#### Persistent storage using the Microsoft Azure File CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Azure File. The Azure File Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview.

For more information, see [Azure File CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-azure-file.html#persistent-storage-csi-azure-file).

#### Persistent storage using the IBM VPC Block CSI Driver Operator

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block. The IBM VPC Block Driver Operator that manages this driver is generally available, and enabled by default in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [IBM VPC Block CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-ibm-vpc-block.html#persistent-storage-csi-ibm-vpc-block).

#### Persistent storage using VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator is generally available

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for vSphere. This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and is now generally available and enabled by default in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [vSphere CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.html#persistent-storage-csi-vsphere).

vSphere CSI Driver Operator installation requires:

* Certain minimum component versions installed. See [CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters](../release_notes/ocp-4-10-release-notes.html#ocp-4-10-installation-vsphere-csi)
* Removal of any non-Red Hat vSphere CSI driver ([Removing a non-Red Hat vSphere CSI Operator Driver](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.html#persistent-storage-csi-vsphere-install-issues_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere))
* Removal of any storage class named `thin-csi`

Clusters are still upgraded even if the preceding conditions are not met, but it is recommended that you meet these conditions to have a supported vSphere CSI Operator Driver.

#### Persistent storage using Microsoft Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator is generally available

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Azure Disk. This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and is now generally available, and enabled by default in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-azure.html#persistent-storage-csi-azure-disk).

#### Persistent storage using AWS Elastic File Storage CSI Driver Operator is generally available

OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic File Storage (EFS). This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 and is now generally available in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-aws-efs.html#persistent-storage-csi-aws-efs).

#### Automatic CSI migration supports Microsoft Azure file (Technology Preview)

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, automatic migration for in-tree volume plugins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers became available as a Technology Preview feature. This feature now supports automatic migration for the Azure File in-tree plugin to the Azure File CSI driver.

For more information, see [CSI automatic migration](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.html#persistent-storage-csi-migration).

#### Automatic CSI migration supports VMware vSphere (Technology Preview)

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, automatic migration for in-tree volume plugins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers became available as a Technology Preview feature. This feature now supports automatic migration for the vSphere in-tree plugin to the vSphere CSI driver.

For more information, see [CSI automatic migration](../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.html#persistent-storage-csi-migration).

#### Using fsGroup to reduce pod timeouts

If a storage volume contains many files (roughly 1,000,000 or greater), you may experience pod timeouts.

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces the ability to use `fsGroup` and `fsGroupChangePolicy` to skip recursive permission change for the storage volume, therefore helping to avoid pod timeout problems.

For more information, see [Using fsGroup to reduce pod timeouts](../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html#using_fsGroup_understanding-persistent-storage).

### Registry

### Operator lifecycle

#### Disabling copied CSVs to support large clusters

When an Operator is installed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), a simplified copy of its cluster service version (CSV) is created in every namespace that the Operator is configured to watch. These CSVs are known as copied CSVs; they identify controllers that are actively reconciling resource events in a given namespace.

On large clusters, with namespaces and installed Operators potentially in the hundreds or thousands, copied CSVs can consume an untenable amount of resources, such as OLMâs memory usage, cluster etcd limits, and networking bandwidth. To support these larger clusters, cluster administrators can now disable copied CSVs for Operators that are installed with the `AllNamespaces` mode.

For more details, see [Configuring Operator Lifecycle Manager features](../operators/admin/olm-config.html#olm-config).

#### Generic and complex constraints for dependencies

Operators with specific dependency requirements can now use complex constraints or requirement expressions. The new `olm.constraint` bundle property holds dependency constraint information. A message field allows Operator authors to convey high-level details about why a particular constraint was used.

For more details, see [Operator Lifecycle Manager dependency resolution](../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-dependency-resolution.html#olm-understanding-dependency-resolution).

#### Operator Lifecycle Manager support for Hypershift

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) components, including Operator catalogs, can now run entirely on Hypershift-managed control planes. This capability does not incur any cost to tenants on worker nodes.

#### Operator Lifecycle Manager support for ARM

Previously, the default Operator catalogs did not support ARM. With this enhancement, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) adds default Operator catalogs to ARM clusters. As a result, the OperatorHub now includes content by default for Operators that support ARM. ([**BZ#1996928**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996928))

### Operator development

#### Hybrid Helm Operator (Technology Preview)

The standard Helm-based Operator support in the Operator SDK has limited functionality compared to the Go-based and Ansible-based Operator support that has reached the Auto Pilot capability (level V) in the [Operator maturity model](../operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.html#olm-maturity-model_olm-what-operators-are).

Starting in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 as a Technology Preview feature, the Operator SDK includes the Hybrid Helm Operator to enhance the existing Helm-based support abilities through Go APIs. Operator authors can generate an Operator project beginning with a Helm chart, and then add advanced, event-based logic to the Helm reconciler in Go language. Authors can use Go to continue adding new APIs and custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the same project.

For more details, see [Operator SDK tutorial for Hybrid Helm Operators](../operators/operator_sdk/helm/osdk-hybrid-helm.html#osdk-hybrid-helm).

#### Custom metrics for Ansible-based Operators

Operator authors can now use the Ansible-based Operator support in the Operator SDK to expose custom metrics, emit Kubernetes events, and provide better logging.

For more details, see [Exposing custom metrics for Ansible-based Operators](../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.html#osdk-monitoring-prometheus).

#### Object pruning for Go-based Operators

The `operator-lib` pruning utility lets Go-based Operators clean up objects, such as jobs or pods, that can stay in the cluster and use resources. The utility includes common pruning strategies for Go-based Operators. Operator authors can also use the utility to create custom hooks and strategies.

For more information about the pruning utility, see [Object pruning utility for Go-based Operators](../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-pruning-utility.html#osdk-pruning-utility_osdk-pruning-utility).

#### Digest-based bundle for disconnected environments

With this enhancement, Operator SDK can now package an Operator project into a bundle that works in a disconnected environment with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). Operator authors can run the `make bundle` command and set `USE_IMAGE_DIGESTS` to `true` to automatically update your Operator image reference to a digest rather than a tag. To use the command, you must use environment variables to replace hard-coded related image references.

For more information about developing Operators for disconnected environments, see [Enabling your Operator for restricted network environments](../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.html#olm-enabling-operator-for-restricted-network_osdk-generating-csvs).

### Builds

* With this update, you can use CSI volumes in OpenShift Builds, which is a Technology Preview feature. This feature relies on the newly introduced Shared Resource CSI Driver and the Insights Operator to import RHEL Simple Content Access (SCA) certificates. For example, by using this feature, you can run entitled builds with `SharedSecret` objects and install entitled RPM packages during builds rather than copying your RHEL subscription credentials and certificates into the builds' namespaces. ([BUILD-274](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/BUILD-274))

  |  | The `SharedSecret` objects and OpenShift Shared Resources feature are only available if you enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set. These Technology Preview features are not part of the default features. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents upgrades. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters. See [Enabling Technology Preview features using FeatureGates](../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.html#post-install-tp-tasks). |
  | --- | --- |
* With this update, workloads can securely share `Secrets` and `ConfigMap` objects across namespaces using inline ephemeral `csi` volumes provided by the Shared Resource CSI Driver. Container Storage Interface (CSI) volumes and the Shared Resource CSI Driver are Technology Preview features. ([BUILD-293](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/BUILD-293))

### Jenkins

* With this update, you can run Jenkins agents as sidecar containers. You can use this capability to run any container image in a Jenkins pipeline that has a correctly configured pod template and Jenkins file. Now, to compile code, you can run two new pod templates named `java-build` and `nodejs-builder` as sidecar containers with Jenkins. These two pod templates use the latest Java and NodeJS versions provided by the `java` and `nodejs` image streams in the `openshift` namespace. The previous non-sidecar `maven` and `nodejs` pod templates have been deprecated. ([JKNS-132](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JKNS-132))

### Machine API

#### Azure Ephemeral OS disk support

With this enhancement, you can create a machine set running on Azure that deploys machines on Ephemeral OS disks. Ephemeral OS disks use local VM capacity rather than remote Azure Storage.

For more information, see [Machine sets that deploy machines on Ephemeral OS disks](../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-azure.html#machineset-azure-ephemeral-os_creating-machineset-azure).

#### Azure Accelerated Networking support

With this release, you can enable Accelerated Networking for Microsoft Azure VMs by using the Machine API. Accelerated Networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide VMs with a more direct path to the switch.

For more information, see [Accelerated Networking for Microsoft Azure VMs](../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-azure.html#machineset-azure-accelerated-networking_creating-machineset-azure).

#### Global Azure availability set support

With this release, you can use availability sets in global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones to ensure high availability.

#### GPU support on Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine enables users to add GPUs to VM instances. Workloads that benefit from access to GPU resources can perform better on compute machines with this feature enabled. With this release, you can define which supported GPU to use for an instance by using the Machine API.

For more information, see [Enabling GPU support for a machine set](../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-gcp.html#machineset-gcp-enabling-gpu-support_creating-machineset-gcp).

#### Cluster autoscaler node utilization threshold

With this enhancement, you can specify a node utilization threshold in the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition. This threshold represents the node utilization level below which an unnecessary node is eligible for deletion.

For more information, see [About the cluster autoscaler](../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.html#cluster-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling).

### Machine Config Operator

#### Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information about configuration drift, see [Understanding configuration drift detection](../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.html#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks).

### Nodes

#### Linux control groups version 2 (Developer Preview)

You can now enable [Linux control groups version 2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) (cgroups v2) on specific nodes in your cluster. The OpenShift Container Platform process for enabling cgroups v2 disables all cgroups version 1 controllers and hierarchies. The OpenShift Container Platform cgroups version 2 feature is in Developer Preview and is not supported by Red Hat at this time. For more information, see [Enabling Linux control groups version 2 (cgroups v2)](../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.html#nodes-nodes-cgroups-2_nodes-nodes-working).

#### Support for swap memory use on nodes (Technology Preview)

You can enable swap memory use for OpenShift Container Platform workloads on a per-node basis. For more information, see [Enabling swap memory use on nodes](../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.html#nodes-nodes-swap-memory_nodes-nodes-working).

#### Place nodes into maintenance mode by using the Node Maintenance Operator

The Node Maintenance Operator (NMO) cordons off nodes from the rest of the cluster and drains all the pods from the nodes. By placing nodes under maintenance, you can investigate problems with a machine, or perform operations on the underlying machine, that might result in a node failure. This is a standalone version of NMO. If you installed OpenShift Virtualization, then you must use the NMO that is bundled with it.

#### Node Health Check Operator enhancements (Technology Preview)

The Node Health Check Operator provides these new enhancements:

* Support for running in disconnected mode
* Prevent conflicts with machine health check. For more information, see [About how node health checks prevent conflicts with machine health checks](../nodes/nodes/eco-node-health-check-operator.html#how-nhc-prevent-conflict-with-mhc_node-health-check-operator)

#### Poison Pill Operator enhancements

The Poison Pill Operator uses `NodeDeletion` as its default remediation strategy. The `NodeDeletion` remediation strategy removes the `node` object.

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, the Poison Pill Operator introduces a new remediation strategy called `ResourceDeletion`. The `ResourceDeletion` remediation strategy removes the pods and associated volume attachments on the node rather than the `node` object. This strategy helps to recover workloads faster.

#### Control plane node migration on RHOSP

You can now migrate control plane nodes from one RHOSP host to another without encountering a service disruption.

### Red Hat OpenShift Logging

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.7, *Cluster Logging* became *Red Hat OpenShift Logging*. For more information, see [Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift Logging](../logging/cluster-logging-release-notes.html).

### Monitoring

The monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features.

#### Monitoring stack components and dependencies

Updates to versions of monitoring stack components and dependencies include the following:

* Alertmanager to 0.23.0
* Grafana to 8.3.4
* kube-state-metrics to 2.3.0
* node-exporter to 1.3.1
* prom-label-proxy to 0.4.0
* Prometheus to 2.32.1
* Prometheus adapter to 0.9.1
* Prometheus operator to 0.53.1
* Thanos to 0.23.1

#### New page for metrics targets in the OpenShift Container Platform web console

A new **Metrics Targets** page in the OpenShift Container Platform web console shows targets for default OpenShift Container Platform projects and for user-defined projects. You can use this page to view, search, and filter the endpoints that are currently targeted for scraping, which helps you to identify and troubleshoot problems.

#### Monitoring components updated to use TLS authentication for metrics collection

With this release, all monitoring components are now configured to use mutual TLS authentication, rather than Bearer Token static authentication for metrics collection. TLS authentication is more resilient to Kubernetes API outages and decreases the load on the Kubernetes API.

#### Cluster Monitoring Operator updated to use the global TLS security profile

With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator components now honor the global OpenShift Container Platform `tlsSecurityProfile` settings.
The following components and services now use the TLS security profile:

* Alertmanager pods (ports 9092 and 9097)
* kube-state-metrics pod (ports 8443 and 9443)
* openshift-state-metrics pod (ports 8443 and 9443)
* node-exporter pods (port 9100)
* Grafana pod (port 3002)
* prometheus-adapter pods (port 6443)
* prometheus-k8s pods (ports 9092 and 10902)
* Thanos query pods (ports 9092, 9093 and 9094)
* Prometheus Operator (ports 8080 and 8443)
* telemeter-client pod (port 8443)

If you have enabled user-defined monitoring, the following pods now use the profile:

* prometheus-user-workload pods (ports 9091 and 10902)
* prometheus-operator pod (ports 8080 and 8443)

#### Changes to alerting rules

* **New**

  + Added a `namespace` label to all Thanos alerting rules.
  + Added the `openshift_io_alert_source="platform"` label to all platform alerts.
* **Changed**

  + Renamed `AggregatedAPIDown` to `KubeAggregatedAPIDown`.
  + Renamed `AggregatedAPIErrors` to `KubeAggregatedAPIErrors`.
  + Removed the `HighlyAvailableWorkloadIncorrectlySpread` alert.
  + Improved the description of the `KubeMemoryOvercommit` alert.
  + Improved `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` alerts to make it consistent with the Kubernetes garbage collection thresholds.
  + Excluded `ReadOnlyMany` volumes from the `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alerts.
  + Extended `PrometheusOperator` alerts to include the Prometheus operator running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
  + Replaced the `ThanosSidecarPrometheusDown` and `ThanosSidecarUnhealthy` alerts by `ThanosSidecarNoConnectionToStartedPrometheus`.
  + Changed the severity of `KubeletTooManyPods` from `warning` to `info`.
  + Enabled exclusion of specific persistent volumes from `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alerts by adding the `alerts.k8s.io/KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp: disabled` label to a persistent volume resource.

|  | Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules. |
| --- | --- |

#### Changes to metrics

* Pod-centric cAdvisor metrics available at the slice level have been dropped.
* The following metrics are now exposed:

  + `kube_poddisruptionbudget_labels`
  + `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_labels`
  + `kube_persistentvolume_labels`
* Metrics with the name `kube_*annotation` have been removed from `kube-state-metrics`.

|  | Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for metrics. |
| --- | --- |

#### Added hard anti-affinity rules and pod disruption budgets for certain components

With this release, hard anti-affinity rules and pod disruption budgets have been enabled for the following monitoring components to reduce downtime during patch upgrades:

* Alertmanager

  |  | As part of this change, the number of Alertmanager replicas has been reduced from three to two. However, the persistent volume claim (PVC) for the removed third replica is not automatically removed as part of the upgrade process. If you have configured persistent storage for Alertmanager, you can remove this PVC manually from the Cluster Monitoring Operator. See the "Known Issues" section for more information. |
  | --- | --- |
* Prometheus adapter
* Prometheus
* Thanos Querier

If you have enabled user-defined monitoring, the following components also use these rules and budgets:

* Prometheus
* Thanos Ruler

#### Alert routing for user-defined projects (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a Technology Preview feature in which an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects monitoring. Users can then add and configure alert routing for their user-defined projects.

#### Alertmanager

Access to the third-party Alertmanager web user interface from the OpenShift Container Platform route has been removed.

#### Prometheus

* OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrators can now configure query logging for Prometheus.
* Access to the third-party Prometheus web user interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release.

#### Prometheus adapter

* The Prometheus adapter now uses the Thanos Querier API rather than the Prometheus API.
* OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrators can now configure audit logs for the Prometheus adapter.

#### Thanos Querier

* Access to the third-party Thanos Querier web user interface from the OpenShift Container Platform route has been removed.
* The `/api/v1/labels`, `/api/v1/label/*/values`, and `/api/v1/series` endpoints on the Thanos Querier tenancy port are now exposed.
* OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrators can now configure query logging.

* If user workload monitoring is enabled, access to the third-party Thanos Ruler web user interface from the OpenShift Container Platform route has been removed.

#### Grafana

Access to the third-party Grafana web user interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release.

### Scalability and performance

#### New Special Resource Operator metrics

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) now exposes metrics to help you watch the health of your SRO custom resources and objects. For more information, see [Prometheus Special Resource Operator metrics](../hardware_enablement/psap-special-resource-operator.html#special-resource-operator-metrics_special-resource-operator).

#### Special Resource Operator custom resource definition fields

Using `oc explain` for Special Resource Operator (SRO) now provides online documentation for SRO custom resource definitions (CRD). This enhancement provides better specifics for CRD fields. ([**BZ#2031875**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2031875))

#### New Node Tuning Operator metric added to Telemetry

A Node Tuning Operator (NTO) metric is now added to Telemetry. Follow the procedure in [Showing data collected by Telemetry](../support/remote_health_monitoring/showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring.html#showing-data-collected-from-the-cluster_showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring) to see all the metrics collected by Telemetry.

#### NFD Topology Updater is now available

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Topology Updater is a daemon responsible for examining allocated resources on a worker node. It accounts for resources that are available to be allocated to new pod on a per-zone basis, where a zone can be a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node. See [Using the NFD Topology Updater](../hardware_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator.html#using-the-nfd-topology-updater_node-feature-discovery-operator) for more information.

#### Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy (Technology Preview)

Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy in OpenShift Container Platform is now available without the need for extra tuning. The cluster administrator can enable this feature if required. Hyperthreads are abstracted by the hardware as logical processors. Hyperthreading allows a single physical processor to execute two heavyweight threads (processes) at the same time, dynamically sharing processor resources.

#### NUMA-aware scheduling with NUMA Resources Operator (Technology Preview)

The default OpenShift Container Platform scheduler does not see individual non-uniform memory access (NUMA) zones in the compute node. This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling of latency-sensitive workloads. A new NUMA Resources Operator is available which deploys a NUMA-aware secondary scheduler. The NUMA-aware secondary scheduler makes scheduling decisions for workloads based on a complete picture of available NUMA zones in the cluster. This ensures that latency-sensitive workloads are processed in a single NUMA zone for maximum efficiency and performance.

For more information, see [About NUMA-aware scheduling](../scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.html#cnf-about-numa-aware-scheduling_numa-aware).

#### Filtering custom resources during ZTP spoke cluster installation using SiteConfig filters

You can now use filters to customize `SiteConfig` CRs to include or exclude other CRs for use in the installation phase of the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) GitOps pipeline. For more information, see [Filtering custom resources using SiteConfig filters](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-install-ztp.html#ztp-filtering-ai-crs-using-siteconfig_ztp-advanced-install-ztp).

#### Disable chronyd in the PolicyGenTemplate CR for vDU use cases

On nodes running RAN vDU applications, you must disable `chronyd` if you update to OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 from earlier versions. To disable `chronyd`, add the following line in the `[service]` section under `.spec.profile.data` of the `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml` file. The `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml` file is referenced in the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR:

```
[service]
service.chronyd=stop,disable
```

For more information, [Recommended cluster configurations to run vDU applications](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-vdu-validating-cluster-tuning.html#ztp-du-cluster-config-reference_vdu-config-ref).

### Backup and restore

### Developer experience

#### Pruning deployment replica sets (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a Technology Preview flag `--replica-sets` to the `oc adm prune deployments` command. By default, only replication controllers are pruned with the `oc adm prune deployments` command. When you set `--replica-sets` to `true`, replica sets are also included in the pruning process.

For more information, see [Pruning deployment resources](../applications/pruning-objects.html#pruning-deployments_pruning-objects).

### Insights Operator

#### Importing simple content access certificates

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, Insights Operator now imports your simple content access certificates from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager by default.

For more information, see [Importing simple content access certificates with Insights Operator](../support/remote_health_monitoring/insights-operator-simple-access.html).

#### Insights Operator data collection enhancements

To reduce the amount of data sent to Red Hat, Insights Operator only gathers information when certain conditions are met. For example, Insights Operator only gathers the Alertmanager logs when Alertmanager fails to send alert notifications.

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* (Conditional) The logs from pods where the `KubePodCrashlooping` and `KubePodNotReady` alerts are firing
* (Conditional) The Alertmanager logs when the `AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts` or `AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts` alerts are firing
* Silenced alerts from Alertmanager
* The node logs from the journal unit (kubelet)
* The `CostManagementMetricsConfig` from clusters with `costmanagement-metrics-operator` installed
* The time series database status from the monitoring stack Prometheus instance
* Additional information about the OpenShift Container Platform scheduler

With this additional information, Red Hat improves OpenShift Container Platform functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

### Authentication and authorization

#### Syncing group membership from OpenID Connect identity providers

This release introduces support for synchronizing group membership from an OpenID Connect provider to OpenShift Container Platform upon user login. You can enable this by configuring the `groups` claim in the OpenShift Container Platform OpenID Connect identity provider configuration.

For more information, see [Sample OpenID Connect CRs](../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.html#identity-provider-oidc-CR_configuring-oidc-identity-provider).

#### Additional supported OIDC providers

The Okta and Ping Identity OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers are now tested and supported with OpenShift Container Platform.

For the full list of OIDC providers, see [Supported OIDC providers](../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.html#identity-provider-oidc-supported_configuring-oidc-identity-provider).

#### oc commands now obtain credentials from Podman configuration locations

Previously, `oc` commands that used the registry configuration, for example `oc registry login` or `oc image` commands, obtained credentials from Docker configuration locations. With OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, if a registry entry cannot be found in the default Docker configuration location, `oc` commands obtain the credentials from Podman configuration locations. You can set your preference to either `docker` or `podman` by using the `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to prioritize the location.

Users also have the option to use the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable, which serves as an alternative to the existing `--registry-config` CLI flag. The `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable is also compatible with `podman`.

#### Support for Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity

You can now use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility `ccoctl` to configure the CCO to use the Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity. When the CCO is configured to use GCP Workload Identity, the in-cluster components can impersonate IAM service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege security credentials to components.

For more information, see [Using manual mode with GCP Workload Identity](../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.html#cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity).

|  | In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8, image registry support for using GCP Workload Identity was removed due to the discovery of [an adverse impact to the image registry](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069807). To use the image registry on an OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8 cluster that uses Workload Identity, you must configure the image registry to use long-lived credentials instead.   With OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.21, support for using GCP Workload Identity with the image registry is restored. For more information about the status of this feature between OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8 and 4.10.20, see the related [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6898641). |
| --- | --- |

## Notable technical changes

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 introduces the following notable technical changes.

#### TLS X.509 certificates must have a Subject Alternative Name

X.509 certificates must have a properly set the Subject Alternative Name field.
If you update your cluster without this, you risk breaking your cluster or rendering it inaccessible.

In older versions of OpenShift Container Platform, X.509 certificates worked without a Subject Alternative Name, so long as the Common Name field was set.
[This behavior was removed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes#ocp-4-6-tls-common-name).

In some cases, certificates without a Subject Alternative Name continued to work in OpenShift Container Platform 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
Because it uses Kubernetes 1.23, OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 does not allow this under any circumstances.

#### Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the Kubernetes controller manager in favor of using cloud controller managers to interact with underlying cloud platforms. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms. The implementation that is added in this release of OpenShift Container Platform supports using cloud controller managers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), VMware vSphere, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview).

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the [Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/).

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the [Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator](../operators/operator-reference.html#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_platform-operators-ref) entry in the *Platform Operators reference*.

#### Operator SDK v1.16.0

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 supports Operator SDK v1.16.0. See [Installing the Operator SDK CLI](../cli_reference/osdk/cli-osdk-install.html#cli-osdk-install) to install or update to this latest version.

|  | Operator SDK v1.16.0 supports Kubernetes 1.22. |
| --- | --- |

Many deprecated `v1beta1` APIs were removed in Kubernetes 1.22, including `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.10.0` and `controller-gen v0.7`. This is a breaking change if you need to scaffold `v1beta1` APIs for custom resource definitions (CRDs) or webhooks to publish your project into older cluster versions.

For more information about changes introduced in Kubernetes 1.22, see [Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes#ocp-4-9-osdk-k8s-api-bundle-validate) and [Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes#ocp-4-9-removed-kube-1-22-apis) in the OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 release notes.

If you have any Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with Operator SDK v1.10.1, see [Upgrading projects for newer Operator SDK versions](../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-upgrading-projects.html#osdk-upgrading-projects) to ensure your projects are upgraded to maintain compatibility with Operator SDK v1.16.0.

#### Changed Cluster Autoscaler alert severity

Previously, the `ClusterAutoscalerUnschedulablePods` alert showed a severity of `warning`, which suggested it required developer intervention. This alert is informational and does not describe a problematic condition that requires intervention. With this release, the `ClusterAutoscalerUnschedulablePods` alert is reduced in severity from `warning` to `info`. ([**BZ#2025230**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025230))

#### Network Observability operator for observing network flows

The Network Observability Operator is General Availability (GA) status in the 4.12 release of OpenShift Container Platform and is also supported in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.

For more information, see [Network Observability](../networking/network_observability/network-observability-overview.html#network-observability-overview).

### Deprecated features

#### IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and x86\_64 v1 architectures will be deprecated

RHCOS functionality in IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and AMD64 (x86\_64) v1 CPU architectures will be deprecated in an upcoming release. Additional details for when support will discontinue for these architectures will be announced in a future release.

|  | AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures (x86-64-v2) will still be supported. |
| --- | --- |

#### Default Docker configuration location deprecation

Previously, `oc` commands that used a registry configuration would obtain credentials from the Docker configuration location, which was `~/.docker/config.json` by default. This has been deprecated and will be replaced by a Podman configuration location in a future version of OpenShift Container Platform.

#### Empty file and stdout support deprecation in oc registry login

Support for empty files using the `--registry-config` and `--to` flags in `oc registry login` has been deprecated. Support for `-` (standard output) has also been deprecated as an argument when using `oc registry login`. They will be removed in a future version of OpenShift Container Platform.

#### Non-sidecar pod templates for Jenkins deprecation

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, the non-sidecar `maven` and `nodejs` pod templates for Jenkins are deprecated. These pod templates are planned for removal in a future release. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of that future life cycle, after which no new feature enhancements are made. Instead, with this update, you can run Jenkins agents as sidecar containers. ([JKNS-257](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JKNS-257))

#### Third-party monitoring components user interface deprecation

For the following monitoring stack components, access to third-party web user interfaces (UIs) is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release:

* Grafana
* Prometheus

As an alternative, users can navigate to the **Observe** section of the OpenShift Container Platform web console to access dashboards and other UIs for platform components.

#### Persistent storage using FlexVolume

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, persistent storage using FlexVolume is deprecated. This feature is still fully supported, but only important bugs will be fixed. However, it may be removed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release.
Out-of-tree Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in OpenShift Container Platform. Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI. Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to CSI driver.

#### RHEL 7 support for the OpenShift CLI (oc) is deprecated

Support for using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is deprecated and will be removed in a future OpenShift Container Platform release.

### Removed features

OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 removes the Jenkins Operator, which was a Technology Preview feature, from the **OperatorHub** page in the OpenShift Container Platform web console interface. Bug fixes and support are no longer available.

Instead, you can continue to deploy Jenkins on OpenShift Container Platform by using the templates provided by the Samples Operator. Alternatively, you can install the Jenkins Helm Chart from the Developer Catalog by using the **Helm** page in the **Developer** perspective of the web console.

#### OpenShift CLI (oc) commands removed

The following OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands were removed with this release:

* `oc adm completion`
* `oc adm config`
* `oc adm options`

#### Scheduler policy removed

Support for configuring a scheduler policy has been removed with this release. Use a [scheduler profile](../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.html#nodes-scheduler-profiles) instead to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

#### RHEL 7 support for compute machines removed

Support for running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 compute machines in OpenShift Container Platform has been removed. If you prefer using RHEL compute machines, they must run on RHEL 8.

You cannot upgrade RHEL 7 compute machines to RHEL 8. You must deploy new RHEL 8 hosts, and the old RHEL 7 hosts must be removed.

#### Third-party monitoring component user interface access removed

With this release, you can no longer access third-party web user interfaces (UIs) for the following monitoring stack components:

* Alertmanager
* Thanos Querier
* Thanos Ruler (if user workload monitoring is enabled)

Instead, you can navigate to the **Observe** section of the OpenShift Container Platform web console to access metrics, alerting, and metrics targets UIs for platform components.

#### Support for minting credentials for Microsoft Azure removed

Support for using the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode on Microsoft Azure clusters has been removed. This change is due to the planned [retirement of the Azure AD Graph API by Microsoft on 30 June 2022](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/update-your-apps-to-use-microsoft-graph-before-30-june-2022/) and is being backported to all supported versions of OpenShift Container Platform in z-stream updates.

For previously installed Azure clusters that use mint mode, the CCO attempts to update existing secrets. If a secret contains the credentials of previously minted app registration service principals, it is updated with the contents of the secret in `kube-system/azure-credentials`. This behavior is similar to passthrough mode.

For clusters with the credentials mode set to its default value of `""`, the updated CCO automatically changes from operating in mint mode to operating in passthrough mode. If your cluster has the credentials mode explicitly set to mint mode (`"Mint"`), you must change the value to `""` or `"Passthrough"`.

|  | In addition to the `Contributor` role that is required by mint mode, the modified app registration service principals now require the `User Access Administrator` role that is used for passthrough mode. |
| --- | --- |

While the Azure AD Graph API is still available, the CCO in upgraded versions of OpenShift Container Platform attempts to clean up previously minted app registration service principals. Upgrading your cluster before the Azure AD Graph API is retired might avoid the need to clean up resources manually.

If the cluster is upgraded to a version of OpenShift Container Platform that no longer supports mint mode after the Azure AD Graph API is retired, the CCO sets an `OrphanedCloudResource` condition on the associated `CredentialsRequest` but does not treat the error as fatal. The condition includes a message similar to `unable to clean up App Registration / Service Principal: <app_registration_name>`. Cleanup after the Azure AD Graph API is retired requires manual intervention using the Azure CLI tool or the Azure web console to remove any remaining app registration service principals.

To clean up resources manually, you must find and delete the affected resources.

1. Using the Azure CLI tool, filter the app registration service principals that use the `<app_registration_name>` from an `OrphanedCloudResource` condition message by running the following command:

   ```
   $ az ad app list --filter "displayname eq '<app_registration_name>'" --query '[].objectId'
   ```

   Example output
   ```
   [
     "038c2538-7c40-49f5-abe5-f59c59c29244"
   ]
   ```
2. Delete the app registration service principal by running the following command:

   ```
   $ az ad app delete --id 038c2538-7c40-49f5-abe5-f59c59c29244
   ```

|  | After cleaning up resources manually, the `OrphanedCloudResource` condition persists because the CCO cannot verify that the resources were cleaned up. |
| --- | --- |

## Bug fixes

#### Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, using a MAC address to configure a provisioning network interface was unsupported when switching the provisioning network from `Disabled` to `Managed`. With this update, a `provisioningMacAddresses` field is added to the `provisioning.metal3.io` CRD. Use this field to identify the provisioning network interface using its MAC address rather than its name. ([**BZ#2000081**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000081))
* Previously, Ironic failed to attach virtual media images for provisioning SuperMicro X11/X12 servers because these models expect a non-standard device string, for example `UsbCd`, for CD-based virtual media. With this update, provisioning now overrides `UsbCd` on SuperMicro machines provisioned with CD-based virtual media. ([**BZ#2009555**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009555))
* Previously, Ironic failed to attach virtual media images on SuperMicro X11/X12 servers due to overly restrictive URl validations on the BMCs of these machines. With this update, the `filename` parameter has now been removed from the URL if the virtual media image is backed by a local file. As a result, the parameter still passes if the image is backed by an object store. ([**BZ#2011626**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011626))
* Previously, the `curl` utility, used by the machine downloader image, did not support classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) with `no_proxy`. A a result, any CIDR in`noProxy` was ignored when downloading the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image. With this update, proxies are now removed from the environment before calling `curl` when appropriate. As a result, when downloading the machine image, any CIDR in `no_proxy` is no longer ignored. ([**BZ#1990556**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990556))
* Previously, virtual media based deployments of OpenShift Container Platform have been observed to intermittently fail on iDRAC hardware types. This occurred when outstanding Lifecycle Controller jobs clashed with virtual media configuration requests. With this update, virtual media deployment failure has been fixed by purging any Lifecycle Controller job while registering iDRAC hardware prior to deployment. ([**BZ#1988879**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988879))
* Previously, users had to enter a long form of an IPv6 address in the installation configuration file, for example `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. Ironic could not find an interface matching this IP address causing the installation to fail. With this update, the IPv6 address supplied by the user is converted to a short form address, for example, `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`. As a result, installation is now successful. ([**BZ#2010698**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2010698))
* Before this update, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot-related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed. ([**OCPBUGS-6886**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6886))
#### Builds

* Before this update, if you created a build configuration containing an image change trigger in OpenShift Container Platform 4.7.x or earlier, the image change trigger might trigger builds continuously.

  This issue happened because, with the deprecation and removal of the `lastTriggeredImageID` field from the `BuildConfig` spec for Builds, the image change trigger controller stopped checking that field before instantiating builds. OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 introduced new fields in the status that the image change trigger controller needed to check, but did not.

  With this update, the image change trigger controller continuously checks the correct fields in the spec and status for the last triggered image ID. Now, it only triggers a build when necessary. ([BZ#2004203](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004203))
* Before this update, image references in Builds needed to specify the Red Hat registry name explicitly. With this update, if an image reference does not contain the registry, the Build searches the Red Hat registries and other well-known registries to locate the image. ([BZ#2011293](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011293))
#### Jenkins

* Before this update, version 1.0.48 of the OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plugin introduced a `NullPointerException` error when Jenkins notified the plugin of new jobs that were not associated with an OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy Build Config. Ultimately, this error was benign because there was no `BuildConfig` object to associate with the incoming Jenkins Job. Core Jenkins ignored the exception in our plugin and moved on to the next listener. However, a long stack trace showed up in the Jenkins log that distracted users. With this update, the plugin resolves the issue by making the proper checks to avoid this error and the subsequent stack trace. ([BZ#2030692](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2030692))
* Before this update, performance improvements in version 1.0.48 of the OpenShift Sync Jenkins plugin incorrectly specified the labels accepted for `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects intended to map into the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin pod templates. As a result, the plugin no longer imported pod templates from `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects with a `jenkins-agent` label.

  This update corrects the accepted label specification so that the plugin imports pod templates from `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects that have the `jenkins-agent` label. ([2034839](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2034839))
#### Cloud Compute

* Previously, editing a machine specification on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) would cause OpenShift Container Platform to attempt to delete and recreate the machine. As a result, this caused an unrecoverable loss of the node it was hosting. With this fix, any edits made to the machine specification after creation are ignored. ([**BZ#1962066**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962066))
* Previously, on clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), floating IP addresses were not reported for machine objects. As a result, certificate signing requests (CSRs) that the kubelet created were not accepted, preventing nodes from joining the cluster. All IP addresses are now reported for machine objects. ([**BZ#2022627**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022627))
* Previously, the check to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing was removed. Consequently, problems arose when the AWS machineâs virtual machine had been removed, but its object was still available. If this happens, the AWS machine would requeue in an infinite loop and could not be deleted or updated. This update restores the check that was used to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing. As a result, machines no longer requeue if they have been updated. ([**BZ#2007802**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007802))
* Previously, modifying a selector changed the list of machines that a machine set observed. As a result, leaks could occur because the machine set lost track of machines it had already created. This update ensures that the selector is immutable once created. As a result, machine sets now lists the correct machines. ([**BZ#2005052**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005052))
* Previously, if a virtual machine template had snapshots, an incorrect disk size was picked due to an incorrect usage of the `linkedClone` operation. With this update, the default clone operation is changed to `fullClone` for all situations. `linkedClone` must now be specified by the user. ([**BZ#2001008**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001008))
* Previously, the custom resource definition (CRD) schema requirements did not allow numeric values. Consequently, marshaling errors occurred during upgrades. This update corrects the schema requirements to allow both string and numeric values. As a result, marshaling errors are no longer reported by the API server conversion. ([**BZ#1999425**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999425))
* Previously, if the Machine API Operator was moved, or the pods were deployed as a result of a name change, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric would reset for each monitored machine. This update changes the metric query to ignore the source pod label. As a result, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric now properly alerts in scenarios where the Machine API Operator pod has been renamed. ([**BZ#1986237**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986237))
* Previously, egress IPs on vSphere were picked up by the vSphere cloud provider within the kubelet. These were unexpected by the certificate signing requests (CSR) approver. Consequently, nodes with egress IPs would not have their CSR renewals approved. This update allows the CSR approver to account for egress IPs. As a result, nodes with egress IPs on vSphere SDN clusters now continue to function and have valid CSR renewals. ([**BZ#1860774**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860774))
* Previously, worker nodes failed to start, and the installation program failed to generate URL images due to the broken path defaulting for the disk image and incompatible changes in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) SDK. As a result, the machine controller was unable to create machines. This fix repairs the URL images by changing the base path in the GCP SDK. ([**BZ#2009111**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009111))
* Previously, the machine would freeze during the deletion process due to a lag in the vCenterâs `powerOff` task. VMware showed the machine to be powered off, but OpenShift Container Platform reported it to be powered on, which resulted in the machine freezing during the deletion process. This update improves the `powerOff` task handling on vSphere to be checked before the task to delete from the database is created, which prevents the machine from freezing during the deletion process. ([**BZ#2011668**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011668))
* After installing or updating OpenShift Container Platform, the value of the metrics showed one pending CSR after the last CSR was reconciled. This resulted in the metrics reporting one pending CSR when there should be no pending CSRs. This fix ensures the pending CSR count is always valid post-approval by updating the metrics at the end of each reconcile loop. ([**BZ#2013528**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013528))
* Previously, AWS checked for credentials when the `cloud-provider` flag was set to empty string. The credentials were checked by making calls to the metadata service, even on non-AWS platforms. This caused latency in the ECR provider startup and AWS credential errors logged in all platforms, including non-AWS. This fix prevents the credentials check from making any requests to the metadata service to ensure that credential errors are no longer being logged. ([**BZ#2015515**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015515))
* Previously, the Machine API sometimes reconciled a machine before AWS had communicated VM creation across its API. As a result, AWS reported the VM does not exist and the Machine API considered it failed. With this release, the Machine API waits until the AWS API has synched before trying to mark the machine as provisioned. ([**BZ#2025767**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025767))
* Previously, a large volume of nodes created simultaneously on UPI clusters could lead to a large number of CSRs being generated. As a result, certificate renewals were not automated because the approver stops approving certificates when there are over 100 pending certificate requests. With this release, existing nodes are accounted for when calculating the approval cut-off and UPI clusters can now benefit from automated certificate renewal even with large scale refresh requests. ([**BZ#2028019**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028019))
* Previously, the generated list of instance types embedded in Machine API controllers was out of date. Some of these instance types were unknown and could not be annotated for scale-from-zero requirements. With this release, the generated list is updated to include support for newer instance types. ([**BZ#2040376**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040376))
* Previously, AWS Machine API controllers did not set the IOPS value for block devices other than the IO1 type, causing IOPS fields for GP3 block devices to be ignored. With this release, the IOPS is set on all supported block device types and users can set IOPS for block devices that are attached to the machine. ([**BZ#2040504**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040504))
#### Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, when using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode on an Azure cluster, the `Upgradeable` status was not set to `False`. This behavior was different for other platforms. With this release, Azure clusters using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode have the `Upgradeable` status set to `False`.
  ([**BZ#1976674**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976674))
* Previously, the now unnecessary `controller-manager-service` service resource that was created by the Cloud Credential Operator was still present. With this release, the Cluster Version Operator cleans it up.
  ([**BZ#1977319**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977319))
* Previously, changes to the log level setting for the Cloud Credential Operator in the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource were ignored. With this release, logging verbosity can be controlled by editing the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource.
  ([**BZ#1991770**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991770))
* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) pod restarted with a continuous error when AWS was the default secret annotator for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). This update fixes the default setting for the CCO pod and prevents the CCO pod from failing. ([**BZ#1996624**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996624))
#### Cluster Version Operator

* Previously, a pod might fail to start due to an invalid mount request that was not a part of the manifest. With this update, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) removes any volumes and volume mounts from in-cluster resources that are not included in the manifest. This allows pods to start successfully. ([**BZ#2002834**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002834))
* Previously, when monitoring certificates were rotated, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) would log errors and monitoring would be unable to query metrics until the CVO pod was manually restarted. With this update, the CVO monitors the certificate files and automatically recreates the metrics connection whenever the certificate files change. ([**BZ#2027342**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027342))
#### Console Storage Plugin

* Previously, a loading prompt was not present while the persistent volumes (PVs) were being provisioned and the capacity was `0` TiB which created a confusing scenario. With this update, a loader is added for the loading state which provides details to the user if the PVs are still being provisioned or capacity is to be determined. It will also inform the user of any errors in the process. ([**BZ#1928285**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928285))
* Previously, the grammar was not correct in certain places and there were instances where translators were unable to interpret the context. This had a negative impact on readability. With this update, the grammar in various places is corrected, the storage classes for translators is itemized, and the overall readability is improved. ([**BZ#1961391**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1961391))
* Previously, when pressing a pool inside the block pools page, the final `Ready` phase persisted after deletion. Consequently, the pool was in the `Ready` state even after deletion. This update redirects users to the **Pools** page and refreshes the pools after detention. ([**BZ#1981396**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1981396))
#### Domain Name System (DNS)

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not cache responses from upstream resolvers that were configured using `spec.servers`. With this update, the DNS Operator now caches responses from all upstream servers. ([**BZ#2006803**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006803))
* Previously, the DNS Operator did not enable the `prometheus` pug-in in the server blocks for custom upstream resolvers. Consequently, CoreDNS did not report metrics for upstream resolvers and only reported metrics for the default server block. With this update, the DNS Operator was changed to enable the `prometheus` plugin in all server blocks. CoreDNS now reports Prometheus metrics for custom upstream resolvers. ([**BZ#2020489**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020489))
* Previously, an upstream DNS that provided a response greater than 512 characters caused an application to fail. This occurred because it could not clone the repository from GitHub because to DNS could not be resolved. With this update, the `bufsize` for KNI CoreDNS is set to 521 to avoid name resolutions from GitHub. ([**BZ#1991067**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991067))
* When the DNS Operator reconciles its operands, the Operator gets the cluster DNS service object from the API to determine whether the Operator needs to create or update the service. If the service already exists, the Operator compares it with what the Operator expects to get to determine whether an update is needed. Kubernetes 1.22, on which OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 is based, introduced a new `spec.internalTrafficPolicy` API field for services. The Operator leaves this field empty when it creates the service, but the API sets a default value for this field. The Operator was observing this default value and trying to update the field back to the empty value. This caused the Operatorâs update logic to continuously try to revert the default value that the API set for the serviceâs internal traffic policy. With this fix, when comparing services to determine whether an update is required, the Operator now treats the empty value and default value for `spec.internalTrafficPolicy` as equal. As a result, the Operator no longer spuriously tries to update the cluster DNS service when the API sets a default value for the serviceâs `spec.internalTrafficPolicy field`. ([**BZ#2002461**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002461))
* Previously, the DNS Operator did not enable the cache plugin for server blocks in the CoreDNS `Corefile` configuration map corresponding to entries in the `spec.servers` field of the `dnses.operator.openshift.io/default` object. As a result, CoreDNS did not cache responses from upstream resolvers that were configured using `spec.servers`. With this bug fix, the DNS Operator is changed to enable the cache plugin for all server blocks, using the same parameters that the Operator already configured for the default server block. CoreDNS now caches responses from all upstream resolvers. ([**BZ#2006803**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006803))
#### Image Registry

* Previously, the registry internally resolved `\docker.io` references into `\registry-1.docker.io` and used it to store credentials. As a result, credentials for `\docker.io` images could not be located. With this update, the `\registry-1.docker.io` hostname has been changed back to `\docker.io` when searching for credentials. As a result, the registry can correctly find credentials for `\docker.io images`. ([**BZ#2024859**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024859))
* Previously, the image pruner job did not retry upon failure. As a result, a single failure could degrade the Image Registry Operator until the next time it ran. With this fix, the temporary problems with the pruner do not degrade the Image Registry Operator. ([**BZ#2051692**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051692))
* Previously, the Image Registry Operator was modifying objects from the informer. As a result, these objects could be concurrently modified by the informer and cause race conditions. With this fix, controllers and informers have different copies of the object and do not have race conditions. ([**BZ#2028030**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028030))
* Previously, `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket` would fail because of an issue with the location of the configuration object in the Image Registry Operator. This update ensures that the configuration object is stored in the correct location. As a result, the Image Registry Operator no longer panics when running `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket`. ([**BZ#2048443**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048443))
* Previously, error handling caused the `access denied` error to be output as `authentication required`. This bug resulted in incorrect error logs. Through Docker distribution error handling, the error output was changed from `authentication required` to `access denied`. Now the `access denied` error provides more precise error logs. ([**BZ#1902456**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902456))
* Previously, the registry was immediately exiting on a shut down request. As a result, the router did not have time to discover that the registry pod was gone and could send requests to it. With this fix, when the pod is deleted it stays active for a few extra seconds to give other components time to discover its deletion. Now, the router does not send requests to non-existent pods during upgrades, which no longer leads to disruptions. ([**BZ#1972827**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972827))
* Previously, the registry proxied response from the first available mirrored registry. When a mirror registry was available but did not have the requested data, pull-through did not try to use other mirrors even if they contained the required data. With this fix, pull-through tries other mirror registries if the first mirror replied with `Not Found`. Now, pull-through can discover data if it exists on any mirror registry. ([**BZ#2008539**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008539))
#### Image Streams

* Previously, the image policy admission plugin did not recognize deployment configurations, notably that stateful sets could be updated. As a result, image stream references stayed unresolved in deployment configurations when the `resolve-names` annotation was used. Now, the plugin is updated so that it resolves annotations in deployment configurations and stateful sets. As a result, image stream tags get resolved in created and edited deployment configurations. ([**BZ#2000216**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000216))
* Previously, when global pull secrets were updated, existing API server pod pull secrets were not updated. Now, the mount point for the pull secret is changed from the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` file to the `/var/lib/kubelet` directory. As a result, the updated pull secret now appears in existing API server pods. ([**BZ#1984592**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984592))
* Previously, the image admission plugin did not check annotations inside deployment configuration templates. As a result, annotations inside deployment configuration templates could not be handled in replica controllers, and they were ignored. Now, the image admission plugin analyzes the template of deployment configurations. With this fix, the image admission plugin recognizes the annotations on the deployment configurations and on their templates. ([**BZ#2032589**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032589))
#### Installer

* The OpenShift Container Platform Baremetal IPI installer previously used the first nodes defined under hosts in `install-config` as control plane nodes rather than filtering for the hosts with the `master` role. The role of `master` and `worker` nodes is now recognized when defined. ([**BZ#2003113**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003113))
* Before this update, it was possible to set host bits in the provisioning network CIDR. This could cause the provisioning IP to differ from what was expected leading to conflict with other IP addresses on the provisioning network. With this update, validation ensures that the provisioning network CIDR cannot contain host bits. If a provisioning Network CIDR includes host bits, the installation program stops and logs an error message. ([**BZ#2006291**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006291))
* Previously, pre-flight checks did not account for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) resource utilization. As a result, those checks failed with an incorrect error message when utilization, rather than quota, impeded installation. Pre-flight checks now process both RHOSP quota and utilization. The checks fail with correct error messages if the quota is sufficient but resources are not. ([**BZ#2001317**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001317))
* Before this update, the oVirt Driver could specify ReadOnlyMany (ROX) and ReadWriteMany (RWX) access modes when creating a PVC from a configuration file. This caused an error because the driver does not support shared disks and, as a result, could not support these access modes. With this update, the access mode has been limited to single node access. The system prevents any attempt to specify ROX or RWX when creating PVC and logs an error message. ([**BZ#1882983**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1882983))
* Previously, disk uploads in the Terraform provider were not handled properly. As a result, the OpenShift Container Platform installation program failed. With this update, disk upload handling has been fixed, and disk uploads succeed. ([**BZ#1917893**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917893))
* Previously, when installing a Microsoft Azure cluster with a special size, the installation program would check if the total number of virtual CPUs (vCPU) met the minimum resource requirement to deploy the cluster. Consequently, this could cause an install error. This update changes the check the installation program makes from the total number of vCPUs to the number of vCPUs available. As a result, a concise error message is given that lets the Operator know that the virtual machine size does not meet the minimum resource requirements. ([**BZ#2025788**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025788))
* Previously, RAM validation for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) checked for values using a wrong unit, and as a result the validation accepted flavors that did not meet minimum RAM requirements. With this fix, RAM validation now rejects flavors with insufficient RAM. ([**BZ#2009699**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009699))
* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform control plane nodes were missing Ingress security group rules when they were schedulable and deployed on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). As a result, OpenShift Container Platform deployments on RHOSP failed for compact clusters with no dedicated workers. This fix adds Ingress security group rules on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) when control plane nodes are schedulable. Now, you can deploy compact three-node clusters on RHOSP. ([**BZ#1955544**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955544))
* Previously, if you specified an invalid AWS region, the installation program continued to try and validate availability zones. This caused the installation program to become unresponsive for 60 minutes before timing out. The installation program now verifies the AWS region and service endpoints before availability zones, which reduces the amount of time the installation program takes to report the error. ([**BZ#2019977**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019977))
* Previously, you could not install a cluster to VMware vSphere if the vCenter hostname began with a number. The installation program has been updated and no longer treats this type of hostname as invalid. Now, a cluster deploys successfully when the vCenter hostname begins with a number.
  ([**BZ#2021607**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021607))
* Previously, if you specified a custom disk instance type when deploying a cluster on Microsoft Azure, the cluster might not deploy. This occurred because the installation program incorrectly determined that the minimum resource requirements had been met. The installation program has been updated, and now reports an error when the number of vcpus available for the instance type in the selected region does not meet the minimum resource requirements. ([**BZ#2025788**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025788))
* Previously, if you defined custom IAM roles when deploying an AWS cluster, you might have to manually remove bootstrap instance profiles after uninstalling the cluster. Intermittently, the installation program did not remove bootstrap instance profiles. The installation program has been updated, and all machine instance profiles are removed when the cluster is uninstalled.
  ([**BZ#2028695**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028695))
* Previously, the default provisioningIP value was different when the host bits were set in the provisioning network CIDR. This resulted in a different value for the provisioningIP than expected. This difference caused a conflict with the other IP addresses on the provisioning network. This fix adds a validation to ensure that the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR does not have host bits set. As a result, if the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR has the host bits set, the installation program will stop and report the validation error. ([**BZ#2006291**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006291))
* Previously, the BMC driver IPMI was not supported for a secure UEFI boot. This resulted in an unsuccessful boot. This fix adds a validation check to ensure that `UEFISecureBoot` mode is not used with bare-metal drivers. As a result, a secure UEFI boot is successful. ([**BZ#2011893**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011893))
* With this update, the 4.8 UPI template is updated from version 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 to match the Ignition version. ([**BZ#1949672**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949672))
* Previously, when asked to mirror the contents of the base registry, the OpenShift Container Platform installation program would exit with a validation error, citing incorrect `install-config` file values for `imageContentSources`. With this update, the installation program now allows `imageContentSources` values to specify base registry names and the installation program no longer exits when specifying a base registry name. ([**BZ#1960378**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1960378))
* Previously, the UPI ARM templates were attaching an SSH key to the virtual machine (VM) instances created. As a result, the creation of the VMs fails when the SSH key provided by the user is the `ed25519` type. With this update, the creation of the VMs succeeds regardless of the type of the SSH key provided by the user. ([**BZ#1968364**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1968364))
* After successfully creating a `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource, AWS might still report that the resource does not exist. Consequently, the AWS Terraform provider fails the installation. With this update, you can retry the query of the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource for a period of time after creation until AWS reports that the resource exists. As a result, installations succeed despite AWS reporting that the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource does not exist. ([**BZ#2032521**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032521))
* Previously, when installing OpenShift Container Platform on AWS with local zones enabled, the installation program could create some resources on a local zone rather than an availability zone. This caused the installation program to fail because load balancers cannot run on local zones. With this fix, the installation program ignores local zones and only considers availability zones when installing cluster components. ([**BZ#1997059**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997059))
* Previously, terraform could attempt to upload the bootstrap ignition configuration file to Azure before it had finished creating the configuration file. If the upload started before the local file was created, the installation would fail. With this fix, terraform uploads the ignition configuration file directly to Azure rather than creating a local copy first. ([**BZ#2004313**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004313))
* Previously, a race condition could occur if the `cluster-bootstrap` and Cluster Version Operator components attempted to write a manifest for the same resource to the Kubernetes API at the same time. This could result in the `Authentication` resource being overwritten by a default copy, which removed any customizations made to that resource. With this fix, the Cluster Version Operator has been blocked from overwriting the manifests that come from the installation program. This prevents any user-specified customizations to the `Authentication` resource from being overwritten. ([**BZ#2008119**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008119))
* Previously, when installing OpenShift Container Platform on AWS, the installation program created the bootstrap machine using the `m5.large` instance type. This caused the installation to fail in regions where that instance type is not available. With this fix, the bootstrap machine uses the same instance type as the control plane machines. ([**BZ#2016955**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016955))
* Previously, when installing OpenShift Container Platform on AWS, the installation program did not recognize EC2 G and Intel Virtualization Technology (VT) instances and defaulted them to X instances. This caused incorrect instance quotas to be applied to these instances. With this fix, the installation program recognizes EC2 G and VT instances and applies the correct instance quotas. ([**BZ#2017874**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017874))
#### Kubernetes API server

#### Kubernetes Scheduler

* Before this update, upgrading to the current release did not set the correct weights for the `TaintandToleration`, `NodeAffinity`, and `InterPodAffinity` parameters. This update resolves the issue so that upgrading correctly sets the weights for `TaintandToleration` to `3`, `NodeAffinity` to `2`, and `InterPodAffinity` to `2`. ([**BZ#2039414**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039414))
* In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, code for serving insecure metrics is removed from the `kube-scheduler` code base. Now, metrics are served only through a secure server. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of a future life cycle. After which, no new feature enhancements are made. ([**BZ#1889488**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1889488))
#### Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) stored pending configuration changes to the disk before operating system (OS) changes were applied. As a result, in situations such as power loss, the MCO assumed OS changes had already been applied on restart, and validation skipped over changes such as `kargs` and `kernel-rt`. With this update, configuration changes to disk are stored after OS changes are applied. Now, if power is lost during the configuration application, the MCO knows it must reattempt the configuration application on restart. ([**BZ#1916169**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916169))
* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project prevented the timely closing of client connections following a VIP failover. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on the API. This update allows the timely closing of client connections following a VIP failover. ([**BZ#1995021**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021))
* Previously, when updating SSH keys, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) changed the owner and group of the `authorized_keys` file to `root`. This update ensures that the MCO preserves `core` as the owner and group when it updates the `authorized_keys` file. ([BZ#1956739](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956739))
* Previously, a warning message sent by the `clone_slave_connection` function was incorrectly stored in a `new_uuid` variable, which is intended to store only the connectionâs UUID. As a result, `nmcli` commands that include the `new_uuid` variable were failing due to the incorrect value being stored in the `new_uuid` variable. With this fix, the `clone_slave_connection` function warning message is redirected to `stderr`. Now, `nmcli` commands that reference the `new_uuid` variable do not fail. ([**BZ#2022646**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022646))
* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library was present in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project. When a Virtual IP (VIP) failed, the client connections might not be closed in a timely manner. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on talking to the API. This fix updates the client library. Now, connections are closed as expected on VIP failovers and the monitor containers do not hang for an excessive period of time. ([**BZ#1995021**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021))
* Before this update, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) stored pending configuration changes to disk before it applied them to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). If a power loss interrupted the MCO from applying the configuration, it treated the configuration as applied and did not validate the changes. If this configuration contained invalid changes, applying them failed. With this update, the MCO saves a configuration to disk only after being applied. This way, if the power is lost while the MCO is applying the configuration, it reapplies the configuration after it restarts. ([**BZ#1916169**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916169))
* Before this update, when you used the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to create or update an SSH key, it set the owner and group of the `authorized_keys` file to `root`. This update resolves the issue. When the MCO creates or updates the `authorized_keys` file, it correctly sets or preserves `core` as the owner and group of the file. ([**BZ#1956739**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956739))
* Previously, in clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), the Ironic `addr-gen-mode` parameter was not being persisted to the OVNKubernetes bridge. As a result, the IPv6 addresses could change when the bridge was created. This broke the cluster because node IP changes are unsupported. This fix persists the `addr-gen-mode` parameter when creating the bridge. The IP address is now consistent throughout the deployment process. ([**BZ#1990625**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990625))
* Previously, if a machine config included a compressed file with the `spec.config.storage.files.contents.compression` parameter set to `gzip`, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) incorrectly wrote the compressed file to disk without extracting it. With this fix, the MCD now extracts a compressed file when the compression parameter is set to `gzip`. ([**BZ#1970218**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970218))
* Previously, `systemd` units were cleaned up only when completely removed. As a result, `systemd` units could not be unmasked by using a machine config because the masks were not being removed unless the `systemd` unit was completely removed. With this fix, when you configure a `systemd` unit as `mask: true` in a machine config, any existing masks are removed. As a result, `systemd` units can now be unmasked. ([**BZ#1966445**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1966445))
#### Management Console

* Previously, the **OperatorHub** category and card links did not include valid `href` attributes. Consequently, the **OperatorHub** category and card links could not be opened in a new tab. This update adds valid `href` attributes to the **OperatorHub** category and card links. As a result, the **OperatorHub** and its card links can be opened in new tabs. ([**BZ#2013127**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013127))
* Previously, on the **Operand Details** page, a special case was created where the conditions table for the `status.conditions` property always rendered before all other tables. Consequently, the `status.conditions` table did not follow the ordering rules of descriptors, which caused unexpected behavior when users tried to change the order of the tables. This update removes the special case for `status.conditions` and only defaults to rendering it first if no descriptor is defined for that property. As a result, the table for `status.condition` is rendered according to descriptor ordering rules when a descriptor is defined on that property. ([**BZ#2014488**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014488))
* Previously, the **Resource Details** page metrics tab was exceeding the cluster-scoped Thanos endpoint. Consequently, users without authorization for this endpoint would receive a `401` response for all queries. With this update, the Thanos tenancy endpoints are updated, and redundant namespace query arguments are removed. As a result, users with the correct role-based access control (RBAC) permissions can now see data in the metrics tab of the **Resource Details** page. ([**BZ#2015806**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015806))
* Previously, when an Operator added an API to an existing API group, it did not trigger API discovery. Consequently, new APIs were not seen by the front end until the page was refreshed. This update makes APIs added by Operators viewable by the front end without a page refresh. ([**BZ#1815189**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1815189))
* Previously, in the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the control plane was not translated into simplified Chinese. As a result, naming differed from OpenShift Container Platform documentation. This update fixes the translation issue in the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. ([**BZ#1982063**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1982063))
* Previously, filtering of virtual tables in the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager was broken. Consequently, all of the available `nodes` would not appear following a search. This update includes new virtual table logic that fixes the filtering issue in the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. ([**BZ#1990255**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990255))
#### Monitoring

* Previously, during OpenShift Container Platform upgrades, the Prometheus service could become unavailable because either two Prometheus pods were located on the same node or the two nodes running the pods rebooted during the same interval.
  This situation was possible because the Prometheus pods had soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement and no `PodDisruptionBudget` resources provisioned.
  Consequently, metrics were not collected and rules were not evaluated over a period of time.

  To fix this issue, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) now configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Prometheus pods are scheduled on different nodes.
  The CMO also provisions `PodDisruptionBudget` resources to ensure that at least one Prometheus pod is always running.
  As a result, during upgrades, the nodes now reboot in sequence to ensure that at least one Prometheus pod is always running. ([**BZ#1933847**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1933847))
* Previously, the Thanos Ruler service would become unavailable when the node that contains the two Thanos Ruler pods experienced an outage.
  This situation occurred because the Thanos Ruler pods had only soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement.
  Consequently, user-defined rules would not be evaluated until the node came back online.

  With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) now configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Thanos Ruler pods are scheduled on different nodes.
  As a result, a single-node outage no longer creates a gap in user-defined rule evaluation. ([**BZ#1955490**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955490))
* Previously, the Prometheus service would become unavailable when the two Prometheus pods were located on the same node and that node experienced an outage.
  This situation occurred because the Prometheus pods had only soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement.
  Consequently, metrics would not be collected, and rules would not be evaluated until the node came back online.

  With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Prometheus pods are scheduled on different nodes.
  As a result, Prometheus pods are now scheduled on different nodes, and a single node outage no longer creates a gap in monitoring.([**BZ#1949262**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949262))
* Previously, during OpenShift Container Platform patch upgrades, the Alertmanager service might become unavailable because either the three Alertmanager pods were located on the same node or the nodes running the Alertmanager pods happened to reboot at the same time.
  This situation was possible because the Alertmanager pods had soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement and no `PodDisruptionBudget` provisioned.
  This release enables hard anti-affinity rules and `PodDisruptionBudget` resources to ensure no downtime during patch upgrades for the Alertmanager and other monitoring components. ([**BZ#1955489**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955489))
* Previously, a false positive `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` alert was triggered when the file system space was occupied by many Docker images.
  For this release, the threshold to fire the `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` warning alert is now reduced to 20% space available, rather than 40%, which stops the false positive alert from firing. ([**BZ#1987263**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987263))
* Previously, alerts for the Prometheus Operator component did not apply to the Prometheus Operator that runs the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace when user-defined monitoring is enabled.
  Consequently, no alerts fired when the Prometheus Operator that manages the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace encountered issues.

  With this release, alerts have been modified to monitor both the `openshift-monitoring` and `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespaces.
  As a result, cluster administrators receive alert notifications when the Prometheus Operator that manages user-defined monitoring encounters issues. ([**BZ#2001566**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001566))
* Previously, if the number of DaemonSet pods for the `node-exporter` agent was not equal to the number of nodes in the cluster, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) would report a condition of `degraded`. This issue would occur when one of the nodes was not in the `ready` condition.

  This release now verifies that the number of DaemonSet pods for the `node-exporter` agent is not less than the number of ready nodes in the cluster. This process ensures that a `node-exporter` pod is running on every active node.
  As a result, the CMO will not report a degraded condition if one of the nodes is not in a ready state. ([**BZ#2004051**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004051))
* This release fixes an issue in which some pods in the monitoring stack would start before TLS certificate-related resources were present, which resulted in failures and restarts. ([**BZ#2016352**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016352))
* Previously, if reporting metrics failed due to reaching the configured sample limit, the metrics target would still appear with a status of `Up` in the web console UI even though the metrics were missing. With this release, Prometheus bypasses the sample limit setting for reporting metrics, and the metrics now appear regardless of the sample limit setting. ([**BZ#2034192**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2034192))
#### Networking

* When using the OVN-Kubernetes network provider in OpenShift Container Platform versions prior to 4.8, the node routing table was used for routing decisions. In newer versions of OpenShift Container Platform, the host routing table is bypassed. In this release, you can now specify whether you want to use or bypass the host kernel networking stack for traffic routing decisions. ([**BZ#1996108**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996108))
* Previously, when Kuryr was used in a restricted installation with proxy, the Cluster Network Operator was not enforcing usage of the proxy to allow communication with the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) API. Consequently, cluster installation did not progress. With this update, the Cluster Network Operator can communicate with the RHOSP API through the proxy. As a result, installation now succeeds. ([**BZ#1985486**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985486))
* Before this update, the SRIOV webhook blocked the creation of network policies on OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) environments. With this update, the SRIOV webhook reads and validates the RHOSP metadata and can now be used to create network policies. ([**BZ#2016334**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016334))
* Previously, the `MachineConfig` object could not be updated because the SRIOV Operator did not pause the `MachineConfig` pool object. With this update, the SRIOV Operator pauses the relevant machine config pool before running any configuration requiring reboot. ([**BZ#2021151**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021151))
* Previously, there were timing issues with `keepalived` that resulted in its termination when it should have been running. This update prevents multiple `keepalived` commands from being sent in a short period of time. As a result, timing issues are no longer a problem and `keepalive` continuously runs. ([**BZ#2022050**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022050))
* Previously, when Kuryr was used in a restricted installation with proxy, the Cluster Networking Operator was not enforcing usage of the proxy to allow communication with the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) API. Consequently, cluster installation did not progress. With this update, the Cluster Network Operator can communicate with the RHOSP API through the proxy. As a result, installation now succeeds. ([**BZ#1985486**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985486))
* Previously, pods that used secondary interfaces with IP addresses provided by the Whereabouts Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin might get stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state because of IP address exhaustion. Now, Whereabouts properly accounts for released IP addresses from cluster events, such as reboots, that previously were not tracked. ([BZ#1914053](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1914053))
* Previously, when using the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, idled services used an increasing amount of CPU to un-idle services. In this release, the idling code for kube-proxy is optimized to reduce CPU utilizing for service idling. ([**BZ#1966521**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1966521))
* Previously, when using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, the presence of any unknown field in an internal configuration map could cause the OVN-Kubernetes pods to fail to start during a cluster upgrade. Now the presence of unknown fields causes a warning, rather than a failure. As a result, the OVN-Kubernetes pods now successfully start during a cluster upgrade. ([**BZ#1988440**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988440))
* Previously, a webhook for the SR-IOV Network Operator blocked network policies for OpenShift installations on OpenStack.
  Users were not able to create SR-IOV network policies.
  This update fixes the webhook.
  Users can now create SR-IOV network policies for installations on OpenStack.
  ([**BZ#2016334**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016334))
* Previously, the CRI-O runtime engine passed pod UIDs by using the `K8S_POD_UID` variable.
  But when pods were deleted and recreated at the same time that Multus was setting up networking for the deleted podâs sandbox, this method resulted in additional metadata and unnecessary processing.
  In this update, Multus handles pod UIDs, and unnecessary metadata processing is avoided.
  ([**BZ#2017882**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017882))
* Previously, in deployments of OpenShift on a single node, default settings for the SR-IOV Network Operator prevented users from making certain modifications to nodes.
  By default, after configuration changes are applied, affected nodes are drained and then restarted with the new configuration.
  This behavior does not work when there is only one node.
  In this update, when you install the SR-IOV Network Operator in a single-node deployment, the Operator changes its configuration so the `.spec.disableDrain` field is set to `true`.
  Users can now apply configuration changes successfully in single-node deployments.
  ([**BZ#2021151**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021151))
* Client-go versions 1.20 and earlier did not have sufficient technique for retrying requests to the Kubernetes API.
  As a result, retries to the Kubernetes API were not sufficient.
  This update fixes the problem by introducing client-go 1.22.
  ([**BZ#2052062**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052062))
#### Node

* Previously, network, IPC, and UTS namespace resources managed by CRI-O were only freed when the Kubelet removed stopped pods. With this update, the Kubelet frees these resources when the pods are stopped. ([**BZ#2003193**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003193))
* Previously, when logging into a worker node, messages might appear indicating a `systemd-coredump` services failure. This was due to the unnecessary inclusion of the `system-systemd` namespace for containers. A filter now prevents this namespace from impacting the workflow. ([**BZ#1978528**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978528))
* Previously, when clusters were restarted, the status of terminated pods might have been reset to `Running`, which would result in an error. This has been corrected and now all terminated pods remain terminated and active pods reflect their correct status. ([**BZ#1997478**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997478))
* Previously, certain stop signals were ignored in OpenShift Container Platform, causing services in the container to continue running. With an update to the signal parsing library, all stop signals are now respected. ([**BZ#2000877**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000877))
* Previously, pod namespaces managed by CRI-O, for example network, IPC, and UTS, were not unmounted when the pod was removed. This resulted in leakage, driving the Open vSwitch CPU to 100%, which caused pod latency and other performance impacts. This has been resolved and pod namespaces are unmounted when removed. ([**BZ#2003193**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003193))
#### OpenShift CLI (oc)

* Previously, due to the increasing number of custom resource definitions (CRD) installed in the cluster, the requests reaching for API discovery were limited by client code restrictions. Now, both the limit number and QPS have been boosted, and client-side throttling should appear less frequently. ([**BZ#2042059**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042059))
* Previously, some minor requests did not have the user agent string set correctly, so the default Go user agent string was used instead for `oc`. The user agent string is now set correctly for all mirror requests, and the expected `oc` user agent string is now sent to registries. ([**BZ#1987257**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987257))
* Previously, `oc debug` assumed that it was always targeting Linux-based containers by trying to run a Bash shell, and if Bash was not present in the container, it attempted to debug as a Windows container. The `oc debug` command now uses pod selectors to determine the operating system of the containers and now works properly on both Linux and Windows-based containers. ([**BZ#1990014**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990014))
* Previously, the `--dry-run` flag was not working properly for several `oc set` subcommands, so `--dry-run=server` was performing updates to resources rather than performing a dry run. The `--dry-run` flags are now working properly to perform dry runs on the `oc set` subcommands. ([**BZ#2035393**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035393))
#### OpenShift containers

* Previously, a container using SELinux could not read `/var/log/containers` log files due to a missing policy. This update makes all log files in `/var/log` accessible including those accessed through symlink. ([**BZ#2005997**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005997))
#### OpenShift Controller Manager

* Previously, the `openshift_apps_deploymentconfigs_last_failed_rollout_time` metric improperly set the `namespace` label as the value of the `exported_namespace` label. The `openshift_apps_deploymentconfigs_last_failed_rollout_time` metric now has the correct `namespace` label set. ([**BZ#2012770**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012770))
#### Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before this update, default catalog sources for the `marketplace-operator` did not tolerate tainted nodes and the `CatalogSource` pod would only have the default settings for tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName`. With this update, the `CatalogSource` specification now includes the optional `spec.grpcPodConfig` field that can override tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName` for the pod. ([**BZ#1927478**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478))
* Before this update, the `csv_suceeded` metric would be lost when the OLM Operator was restarted. With this update, the `csv_succeeded` metric is emitted at the beginning of the OLM Operatorâs startup logic. ([**BZ#1927478**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478))
* Before this update, the `oc adm catalog mirror` command did not set minimum and maximum values for the `--max-icsp-size` flag. As a result, the field accepted values that were less than zero or were too large. With this update, values are limited to sizes greater than zero and less than 250001. Values outside of this range fail validation. ([**BZ#1972962**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972962))
* Before this update, bundled images did not contain the related images needed for Operator deployment in file-based catalogs. As a result, images were not mirrored to disconnected clusters unless specified in the `relatedImages` field of the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV). With this update, the `opm render` command adds the CSV Operator images to the `relatedImages` file when the file-based catalog bundle image is rendered. The images necessary for Operator deployment are now mirrored to disconnected clusters even if they are not listed in the `relatedImages` field of the CSV. ([**BZ#2002075**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002075))
* Before this update, it could take up to 15 minutes for Operators to perform `skipRange` updates. This was a known issue that could be resolved if cluster administrators deleted the `catalog-operator` pod in the `openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace. This caused the pod to be automatically recreated and triggered the `skipRange` upgrade. With this update, obsolete API calls have been fixed in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and `skipRange` updates trigger immediately. ([**BZ#2002276**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002276))
* Occasionally, update events on clusters would happen at the same time that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) modified an object from the lister cache. This caused concurrent map writes. This fix updates OLM so it no longer modifies objects retrieved from the lister cache. Instead, OLM modifies a copy of the object where applicable. As a result, OLM no longer experiences concurrent map writes. ([**BZ#2003164**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003164))
* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) could not establish gRPC connections to catalog source pods that were only reachable through a proxy. If a catalog source pod was behind a proxy, OLM could not connect to the proxy and the hosted Operator content was unavailable for installation. This bug fix introduces a `GRPC_PROXY` environment variable that defines a proxy that OLM uses to establish connections to gRPC catalog sources. As a result, OLM can now be configured to use a proxy when connecting to gRPC catalog sources. ([**BZ#2011927**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011927))
* Previously, skipped bundles were not verified to be members of the same package. Bundles could skip across packages, which broke upgrade chains. This bug fix adds validation to ensure skipped bundles are in the same package. As a result, no bundle can skip bundles in another package, and upgrade graphs no longer break across packages. ([**BZ#2017327**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017327))
* In the `CatalogSource` object, the `RegistryServiceStatus` field stores service information that is used to generate an address that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) relies on to establish a connection with the associated pod. If the `RegistryServiceStatus` field is not nil and is missing the namespace, name, and port information for its service, OLM is unable to recover until the associated pod has an invalid image or spec. With this bug fix, when reconciling a catalog source, OLM now ensures that the `RegistryServiceStatus` field of the `CatalogSource` object is valid and updates its status to reflect the change. Additionally, this address is stored within the status of the catalog source in the `status.GRPCConnectionState.Address` field. If the address changes, OLM updates this field to reflect the new address. As a result, the `.status.connectionState.address` field of a catalog source should no longer be nil. ([**BZ#2026343**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026343))
#### OpenShift API server

#### OpenShift Update Service

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

* Previously, when the RHCOS live ISO added a UEFI boot entry for itself, it assumed the existing UEFI boot entry IDs were consecutive, thereby causing the live ISO to fail in the UEFI firmware when booting on systems with non-consecutive boot entry IDS. With this fix, the RHCOS live ISO no longer adds a UEFI boot entry for itself and the ISO boots successfully. ([**BZ#2006690**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006690))
* To help you determine whether a user-provided image was already booted, information has been added on the terminal console describing when the machine was provisioned through Ignition and whether a user Ignition configuration was provided. This allows you to verify that Ignition ran when you expected it to. ([**BZ#2016004**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016004))
* Previously, when reusing an existing statically keyed LUKS volume during provisioning, the encryption key was not correctly written to disk and Ignition would fail with a "missing persisted keyfile" error. With this fix, Ignition now correctly writes keys for reused LUKS volumes so that existing statically keyed LUKS volumes can be reused during provisioning. ([**BZ#2043296**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043296))
* Previously, `ostree-finalize-staged.service` failed while upgrading a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) node to 4.6.17. To fix this, the sysroot code now ignores any irregular or non-symlink files in `/etc`. ([**BZ#1945274**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1945274))
* Previously, `initramfs` files were missing udev rules for by-id symlinks of attached SCSI devices. Because of this, Ignition configuration files that referenced these symlinks would result in a failed boot of the installed system. With this update, the `63-scsi-sg3_symlink.rules` for SCSI rules are added in dracut. ([**BZ#1990506**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990506))
* Previously, on bare-metal machines, a race condition occurred between `system-rfkill.service` and `ostree-remount.service`. Consequently, the `ostree-remount` service failed and the node operating system froze during the boot process. With this update, the `/sysroot/` directory is now read-only. As a result, the issue no longer occurs. ([**BZ#1992618**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992618))
* Previously, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) live ISO boots added a UEFI boot entry, prompting a reboot on systems with a TPM. With this update, the RHCOS live ISO no longer adds a UEFI boot entry so the ISO does not initiate a reboot after first boot. ([**BZ#2004449**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004449))
#### Performance Addon Operator

* The spec.cpu.reserved` flag might not be correctly set by default if `spec.cpu.isolated` is the only parameter defined in `PerformanceProfile`. You must set the settings for both `spec.cpu.reserved` and `spec.cpu.isolated` in the `PerformanceProfile`. The sets must not overlap and the sum of all CPUs mentioned must cover all CPUs expected by the workers in the target pool. ([**BZ#1986681**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986681))
* Previously, the `oc adm must-gather` tool failed to collect node data if the `gather-sysinfo` binary was missing in the image. This was caused by a missing `COPY` statement in the Dockerfile. To avoid this issue, you must add the necessary `COPY` statements to the Dockerfile to generate and copy the binaries. ([**BZ#2021036**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021036))
* Previously, the Performance Addon Operator downloaded its image from the registry without checking whether it was available on the CRI-O cache. Consequently, the Performance Addon Operator failed to start if it could not reach the registry, or if the download timed out. With this update, the Operator only downloads its image from the registry if it cannot pull the image from the CRI-O cache. ([**BZ#2021202**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021202))
* When upgrading OpenShift Container Platform to version 4.10, any comment (`#comment`) in the tuned profile that does not start at the beginning of the line causes a parsing error. Performance Addon Operator issues can be solved by upgrading it to the same level (4.10) as OpenShift Container Platform. Comment-related errors can be worked around by putting all comments on a single line, with the # character at the start of the line. ([**BZ#2059934**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059934))
#### Routing

* Previously, if the cluster administrator provided a default ingress certificate that was missing the newline character for the last line, the OpenShift Container Platform router would write out a corrupt PEM file for HAProxy. Now, it writes out a valid PEM file even if the input is missing a newline character. ([**BZ#1894431**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894431))
* Previously, a route created where the combined name and namespace for the DNS segment was greater than 63 characters long would be rejected. This expected behavior could cause problems integrating with upgraded versions of OpenShift Container Platform. Now, an annotation allows non-conformant DNS hostnames. With `AllowNonDNSCompliantHostAnnotation` set to `true`, the non-conformant DNS hostname, or one longer than 63 characters, is allowed. ([**BZ#1964112**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964112))
* Previously, the Cluster Ingress Operator would not create wildcard DNS records for Ingress Controllers when the clusterâs `ControlPlaneTopology` was set to `External`. In Hypershift clusters where the `ControlPlaneTopology` was set to `External` and the Platform was AWS, the Cluster Ingress Operator never became available. This updates limits the disabling of DNS updates when the `ControlPlaneTopology` is `External` and the platform is IBM Cloud. As a result, wildcard DNS entries are created for Hypershift clusters running on AWS. ([**BZ#2011972**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011972))
* Previously, the cluster ingress router was blocked from working because the Ingress Operator failed to configure a wildcard DNS record for the cluster ingress router on Azure Stack Hub IPI. With this fix, the Ingress Operator now uses the configured ARM endpoint to configure DNS on Azure Stack Hub IPI. As a result, the cluster ingress router now works properly. ([**BZ#2032566**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032566))
* Previously, the cluster-wide prox configuration could not accept IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting. Consequently, it was impossible to install a cluster whose configuration was having `noProxy` with IPv6 addresses. With this update, the Cluster Network Operator is now able to parse IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting of the cluster-wide proxy resource. As a result, it is now possible to exclude IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting. ([**BZ#1939435**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939435))
* Before OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, the IngressController API did not have any subfields under the `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort` fields. These fields could be null even if the `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.type` was set to `HostNetwork` or `NodePortService`. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, the `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` subfields were added, and the Ingress Operator set default values for these subfields when the Operator admitted or re-admitted an IngressController that specified the "HostNetwork" or "NodePortService" strategy type. With this bug, however, the Operator ignored updates to these spec fields, and updating `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` or `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` to `PROXY` to enable proxy protocol on an existing IngressController had no effect. To work around this issue, it was necessary to delete and recreate the IngressController to enable PROXY protocol. With this update, the Ingress Operator is changed so that it correctly updates the status fields when `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort` are null and when the IngressController spec fields specify proxy protocol with the `HostNetwork` or `NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy type. As a result, setting `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` or `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` to `PROXY` now takes proper effect on upgraded clusters. ([**BZ#1997226**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997226))
#### Samples

* Before this update, if the Cluster Samples Operator encountered an `APIServerConflictError` error, it reported `sample-operator` as having `Degraded status` until it recovered. Momentary errors of this type were not unusual during upgrades but caused undue concern for administrators monitoring the Operator status. With this update, if the Operator encounters a momentary error, it no longer indicates `openshift-samples` as having `Degraded status` and tries again to connect to the API server. Momentary shifts to `Degraded status` no longer occur. ([BZ#1993840](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1993840))
* Before this update, various allowed and blocked registry configuration options in the cluster image configuration might prevent the Cluster Samples Operator from creating image streams. As a result, the samples operator might mark itself as degraded, which impacted the general OpenShift Container Platform install and upgrade status.

  In various circumstances, the management state of the Cluster Samples Operator can make the transition to `Removed`. With this update, these circumstances now include when the image controller configuration parameters prevent the creation of image streams by using either the default image registry or the image registry specified by the `samplesRegistry` setting. The Operator status now also indicates that the cluster image configuration is preventing the creation of the sample image streams. ([BZ#2002368](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002368))
#### Storage

* Previously, the Local Storage Operator (LSO) took a long time to delete orphaned persistent volumes (PVs) due to the accumulation of a 10-second delay. With this update, the LSO does not use the 10-second delay, PVs are deleted promptly, and local disks are made available for new persistent volume claims sooner. ([**BZ#2001605**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001605))
* Previously, Manila error handling would degrade the Manila Operator, and the cluster. Errors are now treated as non-fatal so that the Manila Operator is disabled, rather than degrading the cluster. ([**BZ#2001620**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001620))
* In slower cloud environments, such as when using Cinder, the cluster might become degraded. Now, OpenShift Container Platform accommodates slower environments so that the cluster does not become degraded. ([**BZ#2027685**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027685))
#### Telco Edge

* If a generated policy has a complianceType of `mustonlyhave`, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) updates to metadata are then reverted as the policy engine restores the âexpectedâ state of the CR. Consequently, OLM and the policy engine continuously overwrite the metadata of the CR under conflict. This results in high CPU usage. With this update, OLM and the policy engine no longer conflict, which reduces CPU usage. ([**BZ#2009233**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009233))
* Previously, user-supplied fields in the `PolicyGenTemplate` overlay were not copied to generated manifests if the field did not exist in the base source CR. As a result, some user content was lost. The `policyGen` tool is now updated to support all user supplied fields. ([**BZ#2028881**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028881))
* Previously, DNS lookup failures might cause the Cluster Baremetal Operator to continually fail when installed on unsupported platforms. With this update, the Operator remains disabled when installed on an unsupported platform. ([**BZ#2025458**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025458))
#### Web console (Administrator perspective)

#### Web console (Developer perspective)

* Before this update, resources in the **Developer** perspective of the web console had invalid links to details about that resource. This update resolves the issue. It creates valid links so that users can access resource details. ([BZ#2000651](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000651))
* Before this update, you could only specify a subject in the `SinkBinding` form by label, not by name. With this update, you can use a drop-down list to select whether to specify a subject by name or label. ([BZ#2002266](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002266))
* Before this update, the web terminal icon was available in the web consoleâs banner head only if you installed the Web Terminal Operator in the `openShift-operators` namespace. With this update, the terminal icon is available regardless of the namespace where you install the Web Terminal Operator. ([2006329](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006329))
* Before this update, the service binding connector did not appear in topology if you used a `resource` property rather than a `kind` property to define a `ServiceBinding` custom resource (CR). This update resolves the issue by reading the CRâs `resource` property to display the connector on the topology. ([BZ#2013545](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013545))
* Before this update, the name input fields used a complex and recursive regular expression to validate user inputs. This regular expression made name detection very slow and often caused errors. This update resolves the issue by optimizing the regular expression and avoiding recursive matching. Now, name detection is fast and does not cause errors. ([BZ#2014497](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014497))
* Before this update, feature flag gating was missing from some extensions contributed by the knative plugin. Although this issue did not affect what was displayed, these extensions ran unnecessarily, even if the serverless operator was not installed. This update resolves the issue by adding feature flag gating to the extensions where it was missing. Now, the extensions do not run unnecessarily. ([BZ#2016438](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016438))
* Before this update, if you repeatedly clicked links to get details for resources such as custom resource definitions or pods and the application encountered multiple code reference errors, it failed and displayed a `t is not a function` error. This update resolves the issue. When an error occurs, the application resolves a code reference and stores the resolution state so that it can correctly handle additional errors. The application no longer fails when code reference errors occur. ([BZ#2017130](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017130))
* Before this update, users with restricted access could not access their config map in a shared namespace to save their user settings on a cluster and load them in another browser or machine. As a result, user preferences such as pinned navigation items were only saved in the local browser storage and not shared between multiple browsers. This update resolves the issue: The web console Operator automatically creates RBAC rules so that each user can save these settings to a config map in a shared namespace and more easily switch between browsers. ([BZ#2018234](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018234))
* Before this update, trying to create connections between virtual machines (VMs) in the **Topology** view failed with an "Error creating connection" message. This issue happened because this action relied on a method that did not support custom resource definition (CRDs). This update resolves the issue by adding support for CRDs. Now you can create connections between VMs. ([BZ#2020904](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020904))
* Before this update, the tooltip for tasks in the **PipelineRun details** showed misleading information. It showed the time elapsed since the task ran, not how long they ran. For example, it showed 122 hours for a task that ran for a couple of seconds 5 days ago. With this update, the tooltip shows the duration of the task. ([BZ#2011368](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011368))

## Known issues

* In OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.

  If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 to 4.10, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.

  |  | If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access. |
  | --- | --- |

  Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:

  ```
  ## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
  $ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
  do
  ### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
  index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
  ### Remove the element at index from subjects array
  oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
  done
  ```

  This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:

  + `cluster-status-binding`
  + `discovery`
  + `system:basic-user`
  + `system:discovery`
  + `system:openshift:discovery`

  ([**BZ#1821771**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771))

* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. ([**BZ#1917280**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280))
* Currently, containers start with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities. To work around this issue, modify the entry point of a container using a utility such as `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities before the primary process starts. ([**BZ#2076265**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076265))
* When upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, the Cluster Version Operator blocks the upgrade for approximately five minutes while failing precondition checks. The error text, which says `It may not be safe to apply this update`, might be misleading. This error occurs when one or multiple precondition checks fail. In some situations, these precondition checks might only fail for a short period of time, for example, during an etcd backup. In these situations, the Cluster Version Operator and corresponding Operators will, by design, automatically resolve the failing precondition checks and the CVO successfully starts the upgrade.

  Users should check the status and conditions of their Cluster Operators. If the `It may not be safe to apply this update` error is displayed by the Cluster Version Operator, these statuses and conditions will provide more information about the severity of the message. For more information, see [**BZ#1999777**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999777), [**BZ#2061444**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061444), [**BZ#2006611**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006611).
* The assignment of egress IP addresses to control plane nodes with the egress IP feature is not supported on a cluster provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS). ([**BZ#2039656**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039656))
* Previously, there was a race condition between Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) credentials secret creation and `kube-controller-manager` startup. As a result, Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) cloud provider would not be configured with RHOSP credentials and would break support when creating Octavia load balancers for `LoadBalancer` services. To work around this, you must restart the `kube-controller-manager` pods by deleting the pods manually from the manifests. When you use the workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pods restart and RHOSP credentials are properly configured. ([**BZ#2004542**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004542))
* The ability to delete operands from the web console using the `delete all operands` option is currently disabled. It will be re-enabled in a future version of OpenShift Container Platform. For more information, see [BZ#2012120](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012120) and [BZ#2012971](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012971).
* This release contains a known issue with Jenkins. If you customize the hostname and certificate of the OpenShift OAuth route, Jenkins no longer trusts the OAuth server endpoint. As a result, users cannot log in to the Jenkins console if they rely on the OpenShift OAuth integration to manage identity and access.

  Workaround: See the Red Hat Knowledge base solution, [Deploy Jenkins on OpenShift with Custom OAuth Server URL](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6470721). ([**BZ#1991448**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991448))
* This release contains a known issue with Jenkins. The `xmlstarlet` command line toolkit, which is required to validate or query XML files, is missing from this RHEL-based image. This issue impacts deployments that do not use OpenShift OAuth for authentication. Although OpenShift OAuth is enabled by default, users can disable it.

  Workaround: Use OpenShift OAuth for authentication. ([BZ#2055653](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055653))
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) UPI installation fails when the instance group name is longer than the maximum size of 64 characters. You are restricted in the naming process after adding the "-instance-group" suffix. Shorten the suffix to "-ig" to reduce the number of characters. ([**BZ#1921627**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921627))
* For clusters that run on RHOSP and use Kuryr, a bug in the OVN Provider driver for Octavia can cause load balancer listeners to be stuck in a `PENDING_UPDATE` state while the load balancer that they are attached to remains in an `ACTIVE` state. As a result, the `kuryr-controller` pod can crash. To resolve this problem, update RHOSP to version 16.1.9 ([**BZ#2019980**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019980)) or version 16.2.4 ([**BZ#2045088**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2045088)).
* If an incorrect network is specified in the vSphere `install-config.yaml` file, then an error message from Terraform is generated after a while. Add a check during the creation of manifests to notify the user if the network is invalid. ([**BZ#1956776**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956776))
* The Special Resource Operator (SRO) might fail to install on Google Cloud Platform due to a software-defined network policy. As a result, the simple-kmod pod is not created. ([**BZ#1996916**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996916))
* Currently, idling a stateful set is unsupported when you run `oc idle` for a service that is mapped to a stateful set. There is no known workaround at this time. ([**BZ#1976894**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976894))
* The China (Nanjing) and UAE (Dubai) regions of Alibaba Cloud International Portal accounts do not support installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installations. The China (Guangzhou) and China (Ulanqab) regions do not support a Server Load Balancer (SLB) if using Alibaba Cloud International Portal accounts and, therefore, also do not support IPI installations.
  ([**BZ#2048062**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048062))
* The Korea (Seoul) `ap-northeast-2` region of Alibaba Cloud does not support installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installations. The Korea (Seoul) region does not support a Server Load Balancer (SLB) and, therefore, also does not support IPI installations. If you want to use OpenShift Container Platform in this region, contact [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com). ([**BZ#2062525**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062525))
* Currently, the **Knative Serving - Revision CPU, Memory, and Network usage** and **Knative Serving - Revision Queue proxy Metrics** dashboards are visible to all the namespaces, including those that do not have Knative services. ([BZ#2056682](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056682))
* Currently, in the **Developer** perspective, the **Observe** dashboard opens for the most recently viewed workload rather than the one you selected in the **Topology** view. This issue happens because the session uses the Redux store rather than the query parameters in the URL. ([BZ#2052953](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052953))
* Currently, the **ProjectHelmChartRepository** custom resource (CR) does not show up in the cluster because the API schema for this CR has not been initialized in the cluster yet. ([BZ#2054197](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197))
* Currently, while running high-volume pipeline logs, the auto-scroll functionality does not work and logs are stuck showing older messages. This issue happens because running high-volume pipeline logs generates a large number of calls to the `scrollIntoView` method. ([BZ#2014161](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014161))
* Currently, when you use the **Import from Git** form to import a private Git repository, the correct import type and a builder image are not identified. This issue happens because the secret to fetch the private repository details is not decoded. ([**BZ#2053501**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053501))
* During an upgrade of the monitoring stack, Prometheus and Alertmanager might become briefly unavailable. No workaround for this issue is necessary because the components will be available after a short time has passed. No user intervention is required. ([**BZ#203059**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2030539))
* For this release, monitoring stack components have been updated to use TLS authentication for metrics collection. However, sometimes Prometheus tries to keep HTTP connections to metrics targets open using expired TLS credentials even after new ones have been provided. Authentication errors then occur, and some metrics targets become unavailable. When this issue occurs, a `TargetDown` alert will fire. To work around this issue, restart the pods that are reported as down. ([**BZ#2033575**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033575))
* For this release, the number of Alertmanager replicas in the monitoring stack was reduced from three to two. However, the persistent volume claim (PVC) for the removed third replica is not automatically removed as part of the upgrade process. After the upgrade, an administrator can remove this PVC manually from the Cluster Monitoring Operator. ([**BZ#2040131**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040131))
* Previously, the `oc adm must-gather` tool did not collect performance specific data when more than one `--image` argument was supplied. Files, including node and performance related files, were missing when the operation finished. The issue affects OpenShift Container Platform versions between 4.7 and 4.10. This issue can be resolved by executing the `oc adm must-gather` operation twice, once for each image. As a result, all expected files can be collected. ([**BZ#2018159**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018159))
* When using the Technology Preview oc-mirror CLI plugin, there is a known issue that can occur when updating your cluster after mirroring an updated image set to the mirror registry. If a new version of an Operator is published to a channel by deleting the previous version of that Operator and then replacing it with a new version, an error can occur when applying the generated `CatalogSource` file from the oc-mirror plugin, because the catalog is seen as invalid. As a workaround, delete the previous catalog image from the mirror registry, generate and publish a new differential image set, and then apply the `CatalogSource` file to the cluster. You must follow this workaround each time you publish a new differential image set, until this issue is resolved. ([**BZ#2060837**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060837))
* The processing of the `StoragePVC` custom resource during the GitOps ZTP flow does not exclude the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation when a user does not include a value for it. This annotation causes the `spec.storageClassName` field to be ignored. To avoid this, set the desired `StorageClass` name in the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation within your `PolicyGenTemplate` when using a `StoragePVC` custom resource. ([**BZ#2060554**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060554))
* Removing a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) custom profile enabled on a border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration
  and recreate it without a BFD profile. ([**BZ#2050824**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824))
* For clusters that run on RHOSP and use Mellanox NICs as part of a single-root I/O virtualization configuration (SR-IOV), you may not be able to create a pod after you start one, restart the SR-IOV device plugin, and then stop the pod. No workaround is available for this issue.
* OpenShift Container Platform supports deploying an installer-provisioned cluster without a DHCP server. However, without a DHCP server, the bootstrap VM does not receive an external IP address for the `baremetal` network. To assign an IP address to the bootstrap VM, see [Assigning a bootstrap VM an IP address on the baremetal network without a DHCP server](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6850661). ([**BZ#2048600**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048600))
* OpenShift Container Platform supports deploying an installer-provisioned cluster with static IP addresses on the `baremetal` network for environments without a DHCP server. If a DHCP server is present, nodes might retrieve an IP address from the DHCP server on reboot. To prevent DHCP from assigning an IP address to a node on reboot, see [Preventing DHCP from assigning an IP address on node reboot](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6865841). ([**BZ#2036677**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036677))
* The RHCOS kernel experiences a soft lockup and eventually panics due to a bug in the Netfilter module. A fix is planned to resolve this issue in a future z-stream release of OpenShift Container Platform. ([**BZ#2061445**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061445))
* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see [Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305).
* It is not possible to create a macvlan on the physical function (PF) when a virtual function (VF) already exists. This issue affects the Intel E810 NIC. ([**BZ#2120585**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2120585))
* If a cluster that was deployed through ZTP has policies that do not become compliant, and no `ClusterGroupUpdates` object is present, you must restart the TALM pods. Restarting TALM creates the proper `ClusterGroupUpdates` object, which enforces the policy compliance. ([**OCPBUGS-4065**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4065))
* Currently, when using a persistent volume (PV) that contains a very large number of files, the pod might not start or can take an excessive amount of time to start. For more information, see this [knowledge base article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6221251). ([**BZ1987112**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987112))

## Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 errata are [available on the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/). See the [OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift) for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

|  | Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming OpenShift Container Platform entitlements for OpenShift Container Platform errata notification emails to generate. |
| --- | --- |

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of OpenShift Container Platform 4.10. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

### RHSA-2022:0056 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.3 image release, bug fix, and security update advisory

Issued: 2022-03-10

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.10.3, which includes security updates, is now available. The list of bug fixes that are included in the update is documented in the [RHSA-2022:0056](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0056) advisory. A secondary set of bug fixes can be found in the [RHEA-2022:0748](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2022%3A0748) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2022:0055](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0055) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.3 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform, with OVN-Kubernetes, managed ingress access to services via ExternalIP. When upgrading from 4.10.2 to 4.10.3, access `ExternalIP` stops work with issues like "No Route to Host". With this update, administrators will now have to direct traffic from externalIPs to the cluster. For guidance, see ([KCS\*](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6954851)) and ([**Kubernetes External IPs**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips)) ([**BZ#2076662**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076662))

### RHBA-2022:0811 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.4 bug fix and security update

Issued: 2022-03-15

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.10.4, which includes security updates, is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the [RHBA-2022:0811](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022%3A0811) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2022:0810](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0810) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.4 --pullspecs
```

#### Updating

To update an existing OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 cluster to this latest release, see [Updating a cluster within a minor version by using the CLI](../updating/updating-cluster-cli.html#updating-cluster-cli) for instructions.

### RHBA-2022:0928 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.5 bug fix and security update

Issued: 2022-03-21

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.10.5, which includes security updates, is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the [RHBA-2022:0928](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022%3A0928) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2022:0927](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0927) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.5 --pullspecs
```

#### Known issues

* There is an issue adding a cluster through zero touch provisioning (ZTP) with the name `ztp*`. Adding `ztp` as the name of a cluster causes a situation where `ArgoCD` deletes policies that ACM copies in to the cluster namespace. Naming the cluster with `ztp` leads to a reconciliation loop, and the policies will not be compliant. As a workaround, do not name clusters with `ztp` at the beginning of the name. By renaming the cluster, collision will stop the reconciliation loop and the policies will be compliant. ([**BZ#2049154**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049154))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the **Observer** dashboard from the **Topology** view in the **Developer** console opened to the last viewed workload rather than the selected one. With this update, the **Observe** dashboard in the **Developer** console always opens to the selected workload from the **Topology** view. ([**BZ#2059805**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059805))

#### Updating

To update an existing OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 cluster to this latest release, see [Updating a cluster within a minor version by using the CLI](../updating/updating-cluster-cli.html#updating-cluster-cli) for instructions.

### RHBA-2022:1026 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.6 bug fix and security update

Issued: 2022-03-28

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.10.6, which includes security updates, is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the [RHBA-2022:1026](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022%3A1026) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHSA-2022:1025](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1025) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.6 --pullspecs
```

#### Features

#### Updates from Kubernetes 1.23.5

This update contains changes from Kubernetes 1.23.3 up to 1.23.5. More information can be found in the following changelogs: [1.23.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#v1234) and [1.23.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#v1235)

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the query for subnets in Cisco ACIâs neutron implementation, which is avaiable in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)-16, returned unexpected results for a given network. Consequently, the RHOSP `cluster-api-provider` could potentially try to provision instances with duplicated ports on the same subnet, which caused failed provision. With this update, an additional filter is added in the RHOSP `cluster-api-provider` to ensure there is only one port per subnet. As a result, it is now possible to deploy OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP-16 with Cisco ACI. ([**BZ#2050064**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050064))
* Previously, `oc adm must gather` fell back to the `oc adm inspect` command when the specified image could not run. Consequently, it was difficult to understand information from the logs when the fall back happened. With this update, the logs are improved to make it explicit when a fall back inspection is performed. As a result, the output of `oc adm must gather` is easier to understand. ([**BZ#2049427**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049427))
* Previously, the `oc debug node` command did not have timeout specified on idle. Consequently, the users were never logged out of the cluster. With this update, a `TMOUT` environment variable for debug pod has been added to counter inactivity timeout. As a result, the session will be automatically terminated after `TMOUT` inactivity. ([**BZ#2060888**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060888))
* Previously, the Ingress Operator performed health checks against the Ingress canary route. When the health check completed, the Ingress Operator did not close the TCP connection to the `LoadBalancer` because `keepalive` packets were enabled on the connection. While performing the next health check, a new connection was established to the `LoadBalancer` instead of using the existing connection. Consequently, this caused connections to accumulate on the `LoadBalancer`. Over time, this exhausted the number of connections on the `LoadBalancer`. With this update, Keepalive is disabled when connecting to the Ingress canary route. As a result, a new connection is made and closed each time the canary probe is run. While Keepalive is disabled, there is no longer an accumulation of established connections. ([**BZ#2063283**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063283))
* Previously, the sink for event sources in the `Trigger/Subscription` modal in the **Topology** UI showed all resources, irrespective of whether they were created as a standalone or an underlying resource included with back KSVC, Broker, or KameletBinding. Consequently, users could sink to the underlying addressable resources as they showed up in the sink drop-down menu. With this update, a resource filter has been added to show only standalone resource sink events. ([**BZ#2059807**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059807))

#### Updating

To update an existing OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 cluster to this latest release, see [Updating a cluster within a minor version by using the CLI](../updating/updating-cluster-cli.html#updating-cluster-cli) for instructions.

### RHSA-2022:1162 - OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8 bug fix and security update

Issued: 2022-04-07

OpenShift Container Platform release 4.10.8, which includes security updates, is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the [RHSA-2022:1162](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1162) advisory. The RPM packages that are included in the update are provided by the [RHBA-2022:1161](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022%3A1161) advisory.

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.8 --pullspecs
```

#### Removed features

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8, support for Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity has been removed from OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 for the image registry. This change is due to the discovery of [an adverse impact to the image registry](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069807).

With OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.21, support for using GCP Workload Identity with the image registry is restored. For more information about the status of this feature between OpenShift Container Platform 4.10.8 and 4.10.20, see the related [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6898641).

#### Known issues

* Currently, the web console does not display virtual machine templates that are deployed to a custom namespace. Only templates deployed to the default namespace are displayed in the web console. As a workaround, avoid deploying templates to a custom namespace. ([**BZ#2054650**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054650))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Infrastructure Operator could not provision X11- and X12-based systems due to validation errors created by the bare metal controller (BMC) when special characters such as question marks or equal signs were used in the `filename` parameters of URLs. With this update, the `filename` parameter is removed from the URL if the virtual media image is backed by a local file. ([**BZ#2011626**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011626))
* Previously, when cloning a virtual machine from a template, Operator-made changes reverted after dismissing the dialog box if the boot disk was edited and the storage class was changed. With this update, changes made to storage class remain set after closing the dialogue box. ([**BZ#2049762**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049762))
* Previously, the `startupProbe` field was added to a containerâs definition. As a result, `startupProbe` causes problems when creating a debug pod. With this update, `startupProbe` is removed by default from the debug pod by the `Expose --keep-startup flag` parameter, which is now set to false by default. ([**BZ#2068474**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2068474))
* Previously, the Local Storage Operator (LSO) added an `OwnerReference` object to the persistent volumes (PV) it created, which sometimes caused an issue where a delete request for a PV could leave the PV in the `terminating` state while still attached to the pod. With this update, the LSO no longer creates an `OwnerReference` object and cluster administrators are now able to manually delete any unused PVs after a node is removed from the cluster. ([**BZ#2065714**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065714))
* Before this update, import strategy detection did not occur when a secret was provided for a private Git repository. Consequently, the secrets value was not decoded before it was used. With this update, the secret value is now decoded before use. ([**BZ#2057507**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057507))

$ oc adm release info 4.10.10 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the cluster storage Operator credentials request for Amazon Web Services (AWS) did not include KMS statements. Consequently, persistent volumes (PVs) failed to deploy due to the inability to provide a key. With this update, the default credentials request for AWS now allows the mounting of encrypted volumes using customer-managed keys from KMS. Administrators who create credentials requests in manual mode with Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) must apply those changes manually. Other administrators should not be impacted by this change.

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Infrastructure Operator could not provision X11- and X12-based systems. This was due to validation errors created by the bare metal controller (BMC) when special characters such as question marks or equal signs were used in the `filename` parameters of URLs. With this update, the `filename` parameter is removed from the URL if the virtual media image is backed by a local file. ([**BZ#2011626**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011626))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, when creating an Ingress Object in OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, the API restrictions prevented users from defining routes with hostnames and installing numeric clusters. This fix removes the APIâs number restriction, allowing users to create clusters with numbers and define routes using hostnames. ([**BZ#2072739**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072739))
* Previously, pods related to jobs would get stuck in the Terminating state in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 due to the `JobTrackingWithFinalizers` feature. This fix disables the `JobTrackingWithFinalizers` feature, resulting in all pods to run as intended. ([**BZ2075831**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075831))

##### Update the control plane independently of other worker nodes

With this update, you can now perform a partial cluster update within the **Update Cluster** modal. You are able to update the worker or custom pool nodes to accommodate the time it takes for maintenance. You can also pause and resume within the progress bar of each pool. If one or more worker or custom pools are paused, an alert is displayed at the top of the **Cluster Settings** page. ([**BZ#2076777**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076777))

For more information, see [Preparing to perform an EUS-to-EUS update](../updating/preparing-eus-eus-upgrade.html) and [Updating a cluster using the web console](../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.html).

##### General availability of the Web Terminal Operator

With this update, the [**Web Terminal Operator**](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/web_console/odc-about-web-terminal.html) is now generally available.

##### Support for the AWS premium\_LRS and standardSSD\_LRS disk types

With this update, you can deploy control plane and compute nodes with the `premium_LRS`, `standardSSD_LRS`, or `standard_LRS` disk type. By default, the installation program deploys control plane and compute nodes with the `premium_LRS` disk type. In earlier 4.10 releases, only the `standard_LRS` disk type was supported.

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the federation endpoint for Prometheus that stored user-defined metrics was not exposed. Therefore, you could not access it to scrape these metrics from a network location outside the cluster.
  With this update, you can now use the federation endpoint to scrape user-defined metrics from a network location outside the cluster.
  ([**BZ#2090602**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090602))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, Alibaba Cloud was only supported for disk volumes larger than 20 GiB. Consequently, attempts to dynamically provision a new volume for a persistent volume claim (PVC) smaller than 20GiB failed. With this update, OpenShift Container Platform will automatically increase the volume size for a PVC and it will provision volumes at least with 20 GiB in size.
  ([**BZ#2076671**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076671))
* Previously, the Ingress Operator had unnecessary logic to remove a finalizer on `LoadBalancer-type` services in previous versions of OpenShift Container Platform. With this update, the Ingress Operator no longer includes this logic. ([**BZ#2082161**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082161))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, Bond Container Network Interface (CNI) version 1.0 was not compatible with the Multus Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin. Consequently, the Bond-CNI IP address management (IPAM) improperly populated the `network-status` annotation. With this update, IPAM and Bond-CNI now supports Bond-CNI 1.0. ([**BZ#2084289**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084289))
* Before this update, the **Start Pipeline** dialog box displayed `gp2` as the storage class, regardless of the actual storage class used. With this update, the **Start Pipeline** dialog box displays the actual storage class name.

#### Features

#### Updating managed clusters with Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (Technology Preview)

You can now use the upstream Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager to perform updates on multiple single-node Openshift clusters by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) policies. For more information, see [About the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager configuration](../scalability_and_performance/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.html#cnf-about-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-config_cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager).

#### Low-latency Redfish hardware event delivery (Technology Preview)

OpenShift Container Platform now provides a hardware event proxy that enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware events, such as hardware changes and failures.

The hardware event proxy supports a publish-subscribe service that allows relevant applications to consume hardware events detected by Redfish. The proxy must be running on hardware that supports Redfish v1.8 and later. An Operator manages the lifecycle of the `hw-event-proxy` container.

You can use a REST API to develop applications to consume and respond to events such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is in the 10 millisecond range.

|  | This feature is supported for single node OpenShift clusters only. |
| --- | --- |

#### Zero touch provisioning is generally available

Use zero touch provisioning (ZTP) to provision distributed units at new edge sites in a disconnected environment. This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 and is now generally available and enabled by default in OpenShift Container Platform 4.11. For more information, see [Preparing the hub cluster for ZTP](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster.html#ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster).

#### Indication of done for ZTP

A new tool is available that simplifies the process of checking for a completed zero touch provisioning (ZTP) installation using the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) static validator inform policy. It provides an indication of done for ZTP installations by capturing the criteria for a completed installation and validating that it moves to a compliant state only when ZTP provisioning of the spoke cluster is complete.

This policy can be used for deployments of single node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters.
To learn more about the validator inform policy, see [Indication of done for ZTP installations](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policies.html#ztp-definition-of-done-for-ztp-installations_ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policies).

#### Enhancements to ZTP

For OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, there are a number of updates that make it easier to configure the hub cluster and generate source CRs. New PTP and UEFI secure boot features for spoke clusters are also available. The following is a summary of these features:

* You can add or modify existing source CRs in the `ztp-site-generate` container, rebuild it, and make it available to the hub cluster, typically from the disconnected registry associated with the hub cluster.
* You can configure PTP fast events for vRAN clusters that are deployed using the GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) pipeline.
* You can configure UEFI secure boot for vRAN clusters that are deployed using the GitOps ZTP pipeline.
* You can use Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager to orchestrate the application of the configuration CRs to the hub cluster.

#### ZTP support for multicluster deployment

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) provides support for multicluster deployment, including single node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard OpenShift clusters. This includes the installation of OpenShift and deployment of the distributed units (DUs) at scale. This gives you the ability to deploy nodes with master, worker, and master and worker roles.
ZTP multinode support is implemented through the use of `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs). The overall flow is identical to the ZTP support for single node clusters, with some differentiation in configuration depending on the type of cluster:

In the `SiteConfig` file:

* Single node clusters must have exactly one entry in the `nodes` section.
* Three-node clusters must have exactly three entries defined in the `nodes` section.
* Standard OpenShift clusters must have exactly three entries in the `nodes` section with role: master and one or more additional entries with role: worker.

The `PolicyGenTemplate` file tells the Policy Generator where to categorize the generated policies. Example `PolicyGenTemplate` files provide you with example files to simplify your deployments:

* The example common `PolicyGenTemplate` file is common across all types of clusters.
* Example group `PolicyGenTemplate` files for single node, three-node, and standard clusters are provided.
* Site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` files specific to each site are provided.

To learn more about multicluster deployment, see [Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and ZTP](../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.html#ztp-deploying-a-site_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites).

#### Support for unsecured OS images with Assisted Installer

This release includes the following warning when enabling TLS for the HTTPD server using the Assisted Installer in IPI or ZTP disconnected environments. When enabling TLS for the HTTPD server in these environments, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your OpenShift Container Platform hub and spoke clusters and the HTTPD server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.

#### Known issues

* The Kubelet service monitor scrape interval is currently set to a hard-coded value. This means that there is less available CPU resources for workloads. ([**BZ#2035046**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035046))
* Deploying a single node OpenShift cluster for vRAN Distributed Units can take up to 4 hours. ([**BZ#2035036**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035036))
* Currently, if an RHACM policy was enforced to a target cluster, you can create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR including that enforced policy again as a `managedPolicy` to the same target cluster. This should not be possible. ([**BZ#2044304**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2044304))
* If a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has a `blockingCR` specified, and that `blockingCR` fails silently, for example if there is a typo in the list of clusters, the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is applied even though the `blockingCR` is not applied in the cluster. ([**BZ#2042601**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042601))
* If a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR validation fails for any reason, for example, because of an invalid spoke name, no status is available for the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, as if the CR is disabled. ([**BZ#2040828**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040828))
* Currently, for `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR state changes, there is only a single condition type available - `Ready`. The `Ready` condition can have a status of `True` or `False` only. This does not reflect the range of states the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can be in. ([**BZ#2042596**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042596))
* When deploying a multi-node cluster on bare-metal nodes, the machine config pool (MCP) adds an additional CRI-O drop-in that circumvents the [container mount namespace drop-in](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/cnf-tests/README.md#container-mount-namespace). This results in CRI-O being in the base namespace while the kubelet is in the hidden namespace. All containers fail to get any kubelet-mounted filesystems, such as secrets and tokens. ([**BZ#2028590**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028590))
* Installing RHACM 2.5.0 in the customized namespace causes the `infrastructure-operator` pod to fail due to insufficient privileges. ([**BZ#2046554**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046554))
* OpenShift Container Platform limits object names to 63 characters. If a policy name defined in a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR approaches this limit, the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager cannot create child policies. When this occurs, the parent policy remains in a `NonCompliant` state. ([**BZ#2057209**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057209))
* In the default ZTP Argo CD configuration, cluster names cannot begin with `ztp`. Using names starting with `ztp` for clusters deployed with Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) results in provisioning not completing. As a workaround, ensure that either cluster names do not start with `ztp`, or adjust the Argo CD policy application namespace to a pattern that excludes the names of your clusters but still matches your policy namespace. For example, if your cluster names start with `ztp`, change the pattern in the Argo CD policy app configuration to something different, like `ztp-`. ([**BZ#2049154**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049154))
* During a spoke cluster upgrade, one or more reconcile errors is recorded in the container log. The number of errors corresponds to the number of child policies. The error causes no noticeable impact to the cluster. The following is an example of the reconcile error:

  ```

* During a spoke cluster upgrade from 4.9 to 4.10, with heavy workload running, the `kube-apiserver` pod can take longer than the expected time to start. As a result, the upgrade does not complete and the `kube-apiserver` rolls back to the previous version. ([**BZ#2064024**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2064024))
* If you deploy the AMQ Interconnect Operator, pods run on IPv4 nodes only. The AMQ Interconnect Operator is not supported on IPv6 nodes. ([**ENTMQIC-3297**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTMQIC-3297))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the Ingress Operator detected changes made through the Ingress Controller and set the `Upgradeable` status condition of the Ingress Operator to `False`. The `False` status condition blocked upgrades. With this update, the Ingress Operator no longer blocks upgrades. ([**BZ#2097735**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097735))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, where clusters had a Security Context Constraint (SCC), the default IngressController Deployment could cause pods to fail to start. This was due to the default container name `router` being created without requesting sufficient permissions in the `securityContext` of the container. With this update, router pods will be admitted to the correct SCC and created without error. ([**BZ#2079034**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079034))
* Previously, routers in the terminating state delay the `oc cp` command, which delayed the `must-gather`. With this update, a timeout for each `oc cp` command has been set eliminating the delay of the `must-gathers`. ([**BZ#2106842**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106842))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, new regions were not recognized by the AWS SDK and the machine controller could not use them. This problem occurred because the AWS SDK only recognized regions from the time AWS SDK was vendored. With this update, administrators can use `DescribeRegions` to check the specified region for a machine and create new machines in regions unknown to SDK. ([**BZ#2109124**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109124))

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, the logic in the Ingress Operator did not validate whether a kubernetes service object in the `openshift-ingress` namespace was created by the Ingress Controller it was attempting to reconcile with. Consequently, the Operator would modify or remove kubernetes services with the same name and namespace regardless of ownership. With this update, the Ingress Operator now checks for the ownership of existing kubernetes services it attempts to create or remove. If the ownership does not match, the Ingress Operator provides an error. ([**OCPBUGS-1623**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1623))

Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new podâs MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information. For more information, see [Supported devices](../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov).

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, in CoreDNS v1.7.1, all upstream cache refreshes used DNSSEC. Bufsize was hardcoded to 2048 bytes for the upstream query, causing some DNS upstream queries to break when there were UDP Payload limits within the networking infrastructure. With this update, OpenShift Container Platform always uses bufsize 512 for upstream cache requests as that is the bufsize specified in the Corefile. Customers might be impacted if they rely on the incorrect functionality of bufsize 2048 for upstream DNS requests. ([**OCPBUGS-2902**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2902))
* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform did not handle object storage instances that responded with `204 No Content`. This caused problems for the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) SDK. With this update, the installation program works around the issue when there are zero objects to list in a Swift container. ([**OCPBUGS-5112**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5112))

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.50 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, when rotating Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) credentials, the Cinder Container Storage Interface driver would continue to use old credentials. Using any old credentials that were invalid would cause all volume operations to fail. With this update, the Cinder Container Storage Interface driver is updated automatically when the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) credentials are updated. ([**OCPBUGS-4717**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4717))
* \* Previously, pod failures were artificially extending the validity period of certificates causing them to incorrectly rotate. With this update, the certificate validity period is accurately determined, which helps certificates to rotate correctly. ([**BZ#2020484**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020484))

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.52 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* Previously, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed. ([**OCPBUGS-6886**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6886))
* Previously due to a missing definition for `spec.provider`, the **Operator details** page failed when trying to show `ClusterServiceVersion`. With this update, the user interface works without `spec.provider` and the **Operator details** page does not fail. ([**OCPBUGS-6690**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6690))

You can view the container images in this release by running the following command:

```
$ oc adm release info 4.10.53 --pullspecs
```

#### Bug fixes

* In order to be compatible with OpenStack clouds that do not have Swift installed, Cluster Image Registry Operator (CIRO) has a mechanism for automatically choosing the storage back-end during the first boot. If Swift is available, Swift is used. Otherwise, a persistent volume claim (PVC) is issued and block storage is used. Previously, the CIRO would fall back to using a PVC when it failed to reach Swift. In particular, a lack of connectivity during the first boot would make CIRO fall back to using a PVC. With this change, a failure to reach the OpenStack API, or other incidental failures, cause CIRO to retry the probe. The fallback to PVC occurs only if the OpenStack catalog is correctly found, and it does not contain object storage, or if the current user does not have permission to list containers. ([**OCPBUGS-5974**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5974))
* Previously, the User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) did not create a server group for compute machines. OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 updates the UPI script, so that the script creates a server group for compute machines. The UPI script installation method now aligns with the installer-provisioned installation (IPI) method.

* Previously, the topology sidebar did not display updated information. When you updated the resources directly from the topology sidebar, you had to reopen the sidebar to see the changes. With this fix, the updated resources are displayed correctly. As a result, you can see the latest changes directly in the topology sidebar. ([**OCPBUGS-12438**](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-12438))
* Previously, when creating a `Secret`, the **Start Pipeline** model created an invalid JSON value. As a result, the `Secret` was unusable and the `PipelineRun` could fail. With this fix, the **Start Pipeline** model creates a valid JSON value for the secret. Now, you can create valid secrets while starting a pipeline.
