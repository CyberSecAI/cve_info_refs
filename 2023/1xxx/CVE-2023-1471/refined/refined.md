Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1471

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the 'banner\_id' parameter within the WP Popup Banners plugin before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the plugin does not properly escape or prepare the user-supplied input before including it directly in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs due to the lack of proper input sanitization and SQL query preparation.
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command: The plugin fails to neutralize special characters within the user-provided input, allowing them to be interpreted as SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other potentially confidential details.
- Data Modification/Deletion: Beyond information disclosure, the injection can also allow attackers to modify or delete data within the database, potentially disrupting site functionality or causing data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests with malicious 'banner\_id' parameters to exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Input Parameter: The specific vulnerable parameter is 'banner_id', which is used in the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions (PR:L).
- No User Interaction: The attack does not require any user interaction other than sending the malicious request (UI:N).
- Low Complexity: The attack has a low level of complexity (AC:L).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `wpb_appendto_footer` function of the `wp-popup-banners.php` file. Specifically at line 246 where the user controlled `banner_id` parameter is used directly in the SQL query.
- The affected versions include all versions up to and including 1.2.5 of the WP Popup Banners plugin.
- There is no patch available. The recommended mitigation is to uninstall the plugin until a fix is available.
