The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `crmeb_java` system, specifically in the `/api/admin/system/store/order/list` interface.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly concatenated into an SQL query within the `StoreOrderServiceImpl.java` file. The `keywords` parameter is used in a string concatenation to build the SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is via the `/api/admin/system/store/order/list` endpoint, by manipulating the `keywords` parameter in the HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, implying network access to the application. It seems the attacker needs to have admin privileges to access the endpoint.
