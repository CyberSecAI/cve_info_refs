- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate shortcode attributes before using them to generate file paths, which are then passed to include functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if an attacker can include a file containing malicious code that will then be executed on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious `nd_options_testimonial` shortcode with a `nd_options_layout` attribute pointing to a file path on the server. The vulnerable code uses this path in an include function, without sanitization or verification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with subscriber privileges. The attacker must be able to post content containing shortcodes or use a similar attack vector to trigger the code.
