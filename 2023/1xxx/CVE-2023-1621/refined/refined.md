{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that even if a user's IP address is blocked at the group level, they can still bypass this restriction and commit to projects within that group by making a direct GraphQL API request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation or authorization checks",
      "Bypass of intended access control mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "Users on banned IP addresses can manage push changes to projects where they should be completely blocked from accessing any project that belongs to that group.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct GraphQL API requests",
        "Bypass of IP address restrictions configured in group settings."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Must have valid credentials for a user within the group that has been blocked by IP address.",
      "Must be able to send POST requests to the /api/graphql endpoint with a crafted mutation.",
      "Must be able to craft a GraphQL mutation to commit code changes.",
      "Knowledge of the project path, branch name and files that can be updated in the repository"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The report includes a video demonstration and a sample GraphQL query that can be used to bypass the IP address block. The vulnerability occurs because the GraphQL API does not properly enforce the IP address restrictions set at the group level."
  }
