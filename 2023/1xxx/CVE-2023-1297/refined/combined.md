**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2023-15

**Affected Products / Versions:** Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.13.0 through 1.14.0, and 1.15.0; fixed in 1.14.7 and 1.15.3.

*Cluster peering was a beta feature in Consul 1.13.x. As such, this issue was only addressed in the 1.14.x and 1.15.x branches.*

**Publication Date:** June 2, 2023

**Summary**

A vulnerability was identified in Consul and Consul Enterprise (“Consul”) such that a peer cluster with service of the same name as a local service could corrupt Consul state, resulting in denial of service. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-1297, was resolved in Consul 1.14.7, and 1.15.3.

**Background**

Consul [cluster peering](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/v1.13.x/connect/cluster-peering) is a beta feature to support peering connections between two or more independent clusters so that services deployed to different partitions or datacenters can communicate.

**Details**

During internal testing of cluster peering we observed that, if a local and imported service share the same name, deleting the service on the cluster peer causes Consul’s state to be corrupted, resulting in denial of service.

**Remediation**

Consul administrators should assess risk / exposure as described, and consider upgrading their Consul cluster to version 1.14.7, 1.15.3, or newer.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by the Consul engineering team.
