```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a vulnerable `escapeSql` method which only replaces single quotes with double single quotes, which can be bypassed with a combination of a backslash and single quote, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/admin/robot/approval/list` interface of the Rebuild system.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or manipulation of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the `/admin/robot/approval/list` endpoint with a crafted `q` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint. No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, although it is an admin endpoint, which may require being logged in to the admin panel of the application."
