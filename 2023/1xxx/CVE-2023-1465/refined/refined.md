- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape some generated URLs before outputting them back in pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability against high-privilege users such as administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript can be sent to a logged-in administrator, who, upon opening the URL, will execute the script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator into opening it while logged into the WordPress admin panel.
