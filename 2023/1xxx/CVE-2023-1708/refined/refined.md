Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1708:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how GitLab's web interface handles copying text to the clipboard, specifically the "copy to clipboard" button. It copies all characters, including non-printable ASCII characters, which are not visible in the interface. This allows an attacker to inject hidden characters into a command displayed on the interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Clipboard Handling:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or proper representation of non-printable characters when copying text to the clipboard. The interface displays text without showing hidden characters, leading users to believe they are copying only what they see.
*   **Markdown Injection:** Attackers can inject the malicious content using markdown formatting within various text areas such as comments, README files, etc.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting hidden characters, attackers can modify the command that a user copies and pastes into their terminal. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary system commands on the victim's machine.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** The attacker could potentially gain control of the victim's system, steal sensitive data, or cause denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Interaction:** The attack vector is through the GitLab web interface. The attacker manipulates text displayed on the site, adding hidden characters. The victim, by using the "copy to clipboard" functionality, unknowingly copies these hidden characters along with the visible text.
*   **Markdown:** The injected commands are embedded in Markdown code blocks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a GitLab account.
*   **Repository Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create a public repository or to inject markdown in a place that can be seen by the victim
*   **Content Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to inject text into areas of GitLab (like README files, comments etc.) that the victim might copy from.
*   **Server Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a file on a server they control.

**Additional Details from Report:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated with `wget` and `bash` to download and execute a script.
*   The hidden character is `\xc2\xa0`.
*   The attacker can host the malicious script on their server.
*   The attack works on both Linux and Windows.
*   The attack can be triggered when a victim copies a command from the GitLab web interface, pastes and executes it into their terminal.
