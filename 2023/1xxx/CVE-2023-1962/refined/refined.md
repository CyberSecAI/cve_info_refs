The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability, which is related to the CVE-2023-1962.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `/101news/admin/forgot-password.php` file where the `username` POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting SQL commands. The provided example demonstrates time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access or control over the application.
    - Cause denial of service conditions using time-based attacks.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `username` POST parameter in the `/101news/admin/forgot-password.php` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload in this parameter and sends it via HTTP POST request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which is publicly accessible. No prior access or authentication is explicitly required.
