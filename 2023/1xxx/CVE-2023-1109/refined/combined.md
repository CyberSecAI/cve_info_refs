# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Severity**
8.1

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere[(CWE-668)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/668.html)

**Summary**
*A remote, authenticated attacker could utilize the control program of the CODESYS Control runtime system to use the vulnerability in order to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected products.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22515)

[**CVE-2022-30792**](#cvedetails-CVE-2022-30792)

7.5

**Last Update**
Aug. 30, 2024, 9:28 a.m.

**Severity**
7.5

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption[(CWE-400)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

**Summary**
*In CmpChannelServer of CODESYS V3 in multiple versions an uncontrolled ressource consumption allows an unauthorized attacker to block new communication channel connections. Existing connections are not affected.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30792)

[**CVE-2022-22517**](#cvedetails-CVE-2022-22517)

7.5

**Last Update**
May 25, 2022, 4:27 p.m.

**Severity**
7.5

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Small Space of Random Values[(CWE-334)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/334.html)

**Summary**
*An unauthenticated, remote attacker can disrupt existing communication channels between CODESYS products by guessing a valid channel ID and injecting packets. This results in the communication channel to be closed.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22517)

[**CVE-2022-22514**](#cvedetails-CVE-2022-22514)

7.1

**Last Update**
May 25, 2022, 4:26 p.m.

**Severity**
7.1

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Untrusted Pointer Dereference[(CWE-822)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/822.html)

**Summary**
*An authenticated, remote attacker can gain access to a dereferenced pointer contained in a request. The accesses can subsequently lead to local overwriting of memory in the CmpTraceMgr, whereby the attacker can neither gain the values read internally nor control the values to be written. If invalid memory is accessed, this results in a crash.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22514)

[**CVE-2022-22513**](#cvedetails-CVE-2022-22513)

**Weakness**
NULL Pointer Dereference[(CWE-476)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)

**Summary**
*An authenticated remote attacker can cause a null pointer dereference in the CmpSettings component of the affected CODESYS products which leads to a crash.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22513)

#### Impact

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable industrial controller. Such products contain communication servers for the CODESYS protocol to enable communication with clients.
