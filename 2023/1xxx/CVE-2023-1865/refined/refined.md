Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1865

**Description:** The vulnerability exists in the YourChannel WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.2.3. It stems from a missing authorization check when resetting plugin settings using the `yrc_nuke` GET parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user, even those who are not logged in to the WordPress site.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the WordPress site containing the `yrc_nuke` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
