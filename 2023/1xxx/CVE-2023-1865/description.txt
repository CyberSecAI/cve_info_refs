The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check when  resetting plugin settings via the yrc_nuke GET parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete YouTube channels from the plugin.
