The provided content includes a commit message "Fix SQL Injection" and related code changes on GitHub.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit message explicitly states "Fix SQL Injection," indicating that the vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user inputs within SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into an application's queries, potentially compromising the database.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even potentially gain control of the server hosting the database. The attacker may be able to read or modify any information available to the database user.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This could be any type of input such as form data, URL parameters, or other application interaction points.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the application that ends up in an SQL query. No special network position is needed besides being able to communicate with the target application.
