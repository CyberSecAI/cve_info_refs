The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Dental Clinic Appointment Reservation System v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'firstname' parameter, before displaying it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When a user visits the crafted URL, the script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. In this specific case, the attacker was able to print the user's cookie.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/APR/signup.php` endpoint. The 'firstname' parameter is injected with malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking on a link or visiting a malicious webpage that submits the malicious request.
