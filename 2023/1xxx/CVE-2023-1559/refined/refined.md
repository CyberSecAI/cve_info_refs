Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file upload sanitization in the `/storage/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint. Specifically, the application allows arbitrary file uploads, which are not checked or filtered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload any file type without restrictions or validation. This means executable files, such as PHP scripts, can be uploaded and placed within the server's webroot.
*  **Lack of Filename Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the filename provided in the `filename` parameter of the multipart/form-data, which can lead to overwriting existing files.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The provided information does not specify any file access restrictions after the files are uploaded, meaning they can be accessed and executed by anyone who can access the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload malicious PHP code and execute it on the server, allowing them to perform various malicious activities, including data theft, system takeover, or denial of service.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could result in the complete compromise of the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could use the RCE to exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/storage/classes/Users.php?f=save` with the `filename` parameter included as part of a multipart/form-data.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The attacker crafts a multipart/form-data request to include malicious code as a file, which is then uploaded to the server.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker can use a web browser or an HTTP client like curl to send the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL `/storage/classes/Users.php?f=save` and its required request structure.
*   **Authentication (potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the steps to reproduce mention navigating to the admin dashboard, which may imply the attacker must have at least admin access to reach the vulnerable functionality. However, this isn't clear if the upload functionality could be reached without logging in.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided example shows the attacker uploading a PHP file with the content `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`. This PHP file, when accessed through the browser, displays server configuration details, confirming successful upload and execution.
*   The provided example uses the `filename="info.php"` parameter in the multipart request, showing that the application does not perform proper filename sanitization.
*   The provided information includes the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, along with sample HTTP request and screenshots, making it easier to understand and replicate.
*   This vulnerability can lead to a significant security breach if exploited in a real-world scenario.
