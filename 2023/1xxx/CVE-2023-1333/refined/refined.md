Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1333:

**1. Verification:**
   - The Wordfence article explicitly mentions CVE-2023-1333 and describes a missing authorization vulnerability in the `clear_page_cache` function of the "RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize" plugin. This confirms that the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `clear_page_cache` function. This function is responsible for clearing the plugin's cache.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks on the `clear_page_cache` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with low-level privileges like a "subscriber," to trigger the function.
  -  The code diff shows the `verify_nonce()` function is called, but this does not verify the user role.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete the plugin's cache. This is a loss of data and can cause performance issues on the affected website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through the WordPress AJAX interface by calling the `clear_page_cache` function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. A "subscriber" role is sufficient, indicating a low privilege requirement.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions up to and including 1.7.1
*   **Patched Version:** 1.7.2
*   The Wordfence article provides additional context such as the CVSS score and vector, researcher information, and remediation steps.
