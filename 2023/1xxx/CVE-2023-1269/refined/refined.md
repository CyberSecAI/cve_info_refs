The provided content relates to a commit in the `easyappointments` repository that modifies the seeding process to set dynamic passwords during installation, which is **unrelated** to a specific CVE. The commit changes the default administrator and other user passwords to randomly generated strings. This is not a vulnerability itself, but a change to improve security by avoiding default credentials.

The changes in the commit include:
- Modifying `Console.php` to display the dynamically generated password after installation.
- Modifying `Installation.php` to use `random_string()` for the provider's password during installation.
- Modifying `Instance.php` to generate a random password for the admin user during seeding and return that password. It also generates a random password for the provider during seeding.

This change aims to prevent the use of hardcoded default passwords, which are considered a security risk. It does not introduce a new vulnerability.
