The Ultimate Addons for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.1.23. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers of any authorization level to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
