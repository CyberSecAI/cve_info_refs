The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Nexx Smart Home devices, and **CVE-2023-1748** is specifically associated with the **use of hard-coded credentials**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded credentials are used within the firmware and mobile application of affected Nexx Smart Home devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **CWE-798:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials. The devices contain credentials directly embedded in the software.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* An attacker with access to the Nexx Home mobile application or the affected firmware can view these hard-coded credentials.
* Using these credentials, an attacker can access the MQTT server.
* This access allows remote control of garage doors or smart plugs for any customer.

**Attack vectors:**
* Unauthenticated access to the Nexx Home mobile application.
* Unauthenticated access to the affected firmware.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* Ability to access the Nexx Home mobile application or the device firmware.
* No specific privilege is required, as the vulnerability lies in the use of the hardcoded credentials itself.

The document also details other vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-1749, CVE-2023-1750, CVE-2023-1751, CVE-2023-1752), which are described as follows:
*   **CVE-2023-1749 (CWE-639):** Authorization bypass through user-controlled key, allowing attackers with a valid deviceId to send API requests.
*   **CVE-2023-1750 (CWE-639):** Similar authorization bypass allowing retrieval of device history and settings with a valid deviceId.
*   **CVE-2023-1751 (CWE-20):** Improper input validation in WebSocket server, allowing unauthorized users to receive alarm information meant for other devices.
*   **CVE-2023-1752 (CWE-287):** Improper authentication allowing any user to register an already registered device with only the MAC address.
