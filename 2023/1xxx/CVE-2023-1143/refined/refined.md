Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-1143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an exposed dangerous method or function within the Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master software. Specifically, it allows the use of Lua scripts, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code remotely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposed Dangerous Method or Function (CWE-749):** The software exposes the functionality to execute Lua scripts, which is a dangerous operation if not properly controlled and secured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, system disruption, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (Remote). An attacker can exploit the Lua scripting functionality through network communication with the vulnerable software.
*   The attack has a low complexity requirement
*   The attacker requires low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable InfraSuite Device Master software. They also need to have access to the Lua scripting functionality.
*   No specific user interaction is required.
