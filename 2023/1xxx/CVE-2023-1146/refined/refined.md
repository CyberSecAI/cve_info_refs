Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message "fixes [#87](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/87), possible XSS in config panel" indicates the vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the configuration panel of the FlatPress blog. The commit diff shows that the `wp_specialchars` function is applied to the 'author' and 'email' parameters, which were previously not being sanitized. This suggests that these parameters were vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Input fields in the configuration panel, specifically the 'author' and 'email' fields, were not being properly sanitized before being rendered in the admin interface. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious scripts into these fields that would be executed when an administrator views the configuration panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'author' or 'email' fields, an attacker could execute arbitrary scripts within the context of an administrator's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could potentially steal session cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Account Takeover:** With an administrator's session, attackers could modify blog content, insert malicious code into the website, or even completely take over the FlatPress blog.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Panel Input:** The primary attack vector is through the configuration panel where the author and email fields were vulnerable to XSS.
- **POST Request:** The attacker would craft a POST request that submits malicious code within the 'author' or 'email' fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access and modify the configuration panel settings, which is where the vulnerable parameters are located.
