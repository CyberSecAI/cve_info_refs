### Description

The Download Read More Excerpt Link plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the read\_more\_excerpt\_link\_menu\_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update he plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
