Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a vulnerability related to missing HTML entity conversion in phpMyFAQ. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `privacyURL` configuration value in several files (`contact.php`, `index.php`, and `request-removal.php`). This URL, which is retrieved from the application's configuration, was being directly inserted into HTML attributes without encoding special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is the potential for XSS. If a malicious user were able to inject crafted HTML into the `privacyURL` configuration setting, this could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution when the page is rendered.
- **Improper Output Encoding:** The core issue is the failure to properly encode output, specifically the `privacyURL`. Directly embedding user-controlled data into HTML without encoding is a common source of XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:**  Attackers could potentially steal cookies, leading to session hijacking.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of the page to mislead users.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts could be used to redirect users to malware download sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Manipulation:** An attacker would need to gain access to phpMyFAQ configuration and modify the `privacyURL` setting to inject malicious code. This may require administrative privileges or exploiting another vulnerability which would lead to access of the settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access or Configuration Manipulation Ability:** The attacker must have the ability to change the `privacyURL` configuration value. This would typically require administrative access to the phpMyFAQ instance or some form of access to the settings where this can be controlled/configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves applying `Strings::htmlentities()` to the `privacyURL` before it's inserted into HTML, which will convert special characters into their corresponding HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting them as executable code.
- The commit message "fix: added missing conversion to HTML entities" clearly describes the resolution of this issue.
- The code diffs show the specific locations where the `Strings::htmlentities()` function was added.
- This commit provides more detail about the specific vulnerability than the generic CVE description placeholder.
