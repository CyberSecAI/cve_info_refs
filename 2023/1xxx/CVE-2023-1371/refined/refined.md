Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The W4 Post List plugin fails to properly check if a user has the necessary permissions to view password-protected posts before displaying their content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to password-protected content. Specifically, it does not prevent subscribers (or any authenticated users) from accessing the content of password protected posts.
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not implement checks to verify if a user has the right to view password protected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker (any authenticated user like a subscriber) can bypass the password protection mechanism and access the content of password-protected posts that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request.
- **Web Browser:** The attack can be performed using the web browser's developer console or through a crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site, such as a subscriber.
- **Web Browser Access:** The attacker needs access to a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `parse-media-shortcode` and a `shortcode` parameter containing the `[postlist listId='1']` shortcode (or a similar postlist shortcode).
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the W4 Post List plugin prior to 2.4.6, and was fixed in 2.4.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "NO AUTHORISATION" issue and maps to OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control, and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The CVSS score is 6.5 (medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
