- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session, potentially leading to actions such as account compromise, data theft, or malicious modifications of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with specific parameters, an attacker can inject JavaScript code. When a victim (e.g., an administrator) visits this URL, the injected script executes within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to open a malicious crafted URL.
