The provided content relates to CVE-2023-1932.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `isValid` method of the `org.hibernate.validator.internal.constraintvalidators.hv.SafeHtmlValidator` class within the hibernate-validator library. This method can be bypassed by omitting the closing tag (less than sign) in HTML input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input validation of HTML content.
- The SafeHtmlValidator fails to properly sanitize or reject invalid HTML input where the tag ending is missing the less-than character.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  HTML injection: Allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML into web pages.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Enables attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious user input containing HTML with missing closing tags is passed to the vulnerable method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable `SafeHtmlValidator` and rendered by the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects hibernate-validator versions 6.1.2.Final and other mentioned fixed versions 6.2 and 7.0
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0's OpenDaylight (ODL) includes a vulnerable version of hibernate-validator.
- Supported versions of Satellite 6 also include vulnerable versions of hibernate-validator in the candlepin component. However, it is stated that the vulnerable functionality is not used.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by omitting the tag ending (<) allowing rendering of invalid HTML.
