Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper access controls or permissions on several files within the CMS, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure via direct access to files that should not be publicly accessible. Specifically:
    *   `/dayrui/My/View/main.html`: Likely contains user interface or configuration information.
    *   `/config/myfield/test.php`:  A PHP configuration file which might contain sensitive database credentials or other configuration data.
    *   `/dayrui/My/Config/Install.txt`: Likely contains installation or configuration details of the CMS.
    *   `/dayrui/Fcms/View/system_log.html`: Contains system logs that could reveal internal workings of the CMS, errors, and potentially sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** An attacker can gain access to configuration files, potentially revealing database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data.
*   **Internal System Information:** Access to system logs reveals information about the internal operations of the CMS, which can be used for further targeted attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The exposed configuration details may allow for other attacks, such as SQL injection or remote code execution, by revealing sensitive configuration details or allowing the attacker to modify sensitive files.
*   **Compromise of CMS security**: Accessing the mentioned files will allow an attacker to gain internal information about the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct File Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable files by knowing or guessing their paths through a web browser. This can be done using a simple HTTP GET request for each of the exposed files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable CMS.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the exact file paths of the vulnerable resources. The paths are provided in the document.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided markdown document includes screenshots confirming the information disclosure for each of the listed paths.
* The document implies that the issue was found by user 'mengleng'.
* The provided information gives the impression of being a 'bug report' or a description of a finding rather than an exploit.
