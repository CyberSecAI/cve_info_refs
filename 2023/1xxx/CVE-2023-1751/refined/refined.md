**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nexx Smart Home devices' WebSocket server does not validate if the bearer token in the Authorization header belongs to the device attempting to associate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The WebSocket server lacks proper validation of the bearer token in the Authorization header.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could receive alarm information and signals meant for other devices, potentially leaking a deviceId.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be an authorized user.
*   The attacker needs to send crafted web socket requests with an arbitrary bearer token.
