The provided content relates to CVE-2023-1092. It describes a CSRF vulnerability in the "OAuth Single Sign On - SSO (OAuth Client)" WordPress plugin, affecting multiple versions across different editions (Free, Standard, Premium, Enterprise) of the plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks CSRF checks when deleting Identity Providers (IdP).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary Identity Providers (IdP). This could disrupt the SSO functionality of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker would need to craft a malicious link or form that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in administrator, would trigger the IdP deletion. This could be achieved via social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target system, but they need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form.

The affected versions are:
- Free < 6.24.2
- Standard < 28.4.9
- Premium < 38.4.9
- Enterprise < 48.4.9
