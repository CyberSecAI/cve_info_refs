- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape various parameters before outputting them back in pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browser of a victim, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions, especially if a high-privilege user like an admin is targeted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the malicious script in the vulnerable parameter, and trick a victim into opening the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and social engineer a user, especially an admin, to visit this crafted URL while logged into the vulnerable application.
