The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in a PHP-based "Sales Tracker Management System".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input being used directly in an SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `view_client.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   The attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   Database compromise could lead to further system compromises.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `view_client.php` with a malicious value in the `id` parameter.
*   The vulnerable URL is `http://192.168.131.135/php-sts/admin/clients/view_client.php?id=1`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   The attacker can use tools like sqlmap to automate the exploitation.

**Additional details from the content (not present in standard CVE description):**

*   The content includes a specific vulnerable URL and parameter (`id`).
*   It provides sqlmap command and screenshots of sqlmap output demonstrating successful exploitation of SQL injection.
*   It provides a link to the source code download location.
