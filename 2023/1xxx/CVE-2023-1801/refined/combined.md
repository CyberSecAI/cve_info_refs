Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-de10e674ae
2023-04-28 02:22:23.220524
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 1.10.4
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://www.tcpdump.org/>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Have a common routine for converting dates and times to strings.

```
Have a routine that takes a buffer, a strftime format, and a struct tm *
as arguments, and:

* checks whether the struct tm * is null and, if so, returns a string
indicating that the date and time couldn't be converted;

* otherwise, passes it to strftime(), along with the buffer and the
format argument and, if strftime() returns 0, meaning the string didn't
fit into the buffer and thus that the buffer's contents are undefined,
returns a string indicating that the date and time didn't fit into the
buffer;

* otherwise, returns a pointer to the buffer.

Call that routine instead of directly calling strftime() in printers;
that prevents printing a buffer with undefined data if the buffer isn't
big enough for the string.

Also, when generating file names using an strftime format, check the
return value of strftime() to make sure the buffer didn't overflow.
```

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Have a common routine for converting dates and times to strings.

```
Have a routine that takes a buffer, a strftime format, and a struct tm *
as arguments, and:

* checks whether the struct tm * is null and, if so, returns a string
indicating that the date and time couldn't be converted;

* otherwise, passes it to strftime(), along with the buffer and the
format argument and, if strftime() returns 0, meaning the string didn't
fit into the buffer and thus that the buffer's contents are undefined,
returns a string indicating that the date and time didn't fit into the
buffer;

* otherwise, returns a pointer to the buffer.

Call that routine instead of directly calling strftime() in printers;
that prevents printing a buffer with undefined data if the buffer isn't
big enough for the string.

Also, when generating file names using an strftime format, check the
return value of strftime() to make sure the buffer didn't overflow.
```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-33906c7c4a
2023-04-20 04:40:58.216661
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 1.10.4
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://www.tcpdump.org/>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.
