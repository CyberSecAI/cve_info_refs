Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `FileUtils.unzip` method within the Fastcms system. This method lacks proper checks and sanitization when extracting files from a zip archive. Specifically, it doesn't validate the file paths contained within the zip, allowing an attacker to include relative path specifiers like "../" to perform a directory traversal attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of path sanitization during zip file extraction. This allows an attacker to specify file paths that reach outside of the intended target directory, enabling them to write to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** By crafting a malicious zip archive, an attacker can write files to any location on the server where the application has write permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can gain server privileges by writing a malicious file to the server, such as overwriting files, uploading a webshell, or in this specific case, injecting an SSH public key to the authorized keys file to gain remote access. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Data Breaches:** With access to the server, an attacker may be able to access, modify or steal sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Zip Upload:** The vulnerability is exploited by uploading a crafted zip file to the `/fastcms/admin/template/install` endpoint. This endpoint appears to use `FileUtils.unzip` for file extraction, making it the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the `/fastcms/admin/template/install` endpoint:** The attacker must have the authorization to access and upload files via this specific endpoint. According to one of the comments, the attacker must have the permission to install templates.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Zip:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted zip archive containing path traversal sequences.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported by user "ha1yu" and confirmed by "my-fastcms", the owner of the repository.
* The vulnerability was resolved by using the `org.zeroturnaround zt-zip 1.15` library.
* The user "ha1yu" also suggested filtering out the "../" string during the unzip process as a way to prevent directory traversal attacks.
