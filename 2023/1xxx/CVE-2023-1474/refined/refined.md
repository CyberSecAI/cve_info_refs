The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` GET parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/aqpg/users/question_papers/manage_question_paper.php` file.
- Lack of proper input sanitization for the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data modification/deletion
    - Server compromise via techniques like time-based blind injection

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the GET request with the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are needed.
- The attacker can be an unauthenticated user on the network.
