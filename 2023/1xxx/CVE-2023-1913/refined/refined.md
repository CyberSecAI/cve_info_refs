Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Maps Widget for Google Maps" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving widget settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into the widget settings, which are then stored in the database. These scripts are executed when the affected pages are loaded, impacting any user who views the page with the compromised widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute within the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the affected widget. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Modifying page content or layout
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    *   Data theft or manipulation

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Settings:** The attack vector is the widget settings within the WordPress plugin. Specifically, header and footer fields are vulnerable.
*   **Stored Payload:**  The malicious script is stored within the widget settings in the WordPress database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Administrator or Higher:** The attacker must have administrator-level permissions or higher to access and modify widget settings.
*   **Multi-site or unfiltered HTML disabled:** The vulnerability specifically affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Maps Widget for Google Maps" plugin up to and including version 4.24.
*   The fix was implemented in version 4.25, which introduces proper sanitization using `sanitize_text_field` and `wp_kses_post` on vulnerable fields.
*   The vulnerable fields include title, address, thumb pin label, thumb pin image, thumb header, thumb footer, lightbox header, and lightbox footer.
*   The patch adds sanitization to these fields using WordPress functions such as `sanitize_text_field` and `wp_kses_post`, which remove dangerous HTML tags and attributes.
