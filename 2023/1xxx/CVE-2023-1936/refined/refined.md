Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the GitLab API endpoint `/api/v4/projects/:id/issues` which, despite the intended redaction of service desk email addresses for users with insufficient roles, exposes the `service_desk_reply_to` field containing the email address of the issue creator to users with `guest` role.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The API endpoint fails to properly enforce access restrictions regarding the `service_desk_reply_to` field, leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Data Leakage:** The `service_desk_reply_to` field, which should be redacted for `guest` users, is exposed in the API response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** A guest user can leak the private email address of the service desk issue creator.
*   **Circumvention of Redaction:** The intended redaction of service desk email addresses for users with insufficient roles is circumvented.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `/api/v4/projects/:id/issues` endpoint.
*   **Access Token:** The attacker uses a `guest` user's API access token to make the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Role:** The attacker must have at least a `guest` role in the project where the service desk issue was created.
*   **API Access Token:** The attacker needs a valid API access token for the `guest` user.
*   **Knowledge of Project ID:** The attacker must know the ID of the project where the service desk issue exists.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists even if the issue is public.
*   The issue was introduced in GitLab 15.9, along with the redaction feature for service desk emails.
*   The provided video demonstrates the leak.
