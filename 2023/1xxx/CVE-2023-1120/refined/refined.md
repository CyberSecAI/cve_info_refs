- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Method Title" field within the sharing method settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view a giveaway page on the frontend. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with administrator privileges can inject the malicious script through the plugin's settings page ( "Giveaways" > "Settings" > "Sharing Method"). Any user, even unauthenticated users, who visit the frontend giveaway page will trigger the stored XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator privileges on the WordPress site to access and modify the plugin settings.
