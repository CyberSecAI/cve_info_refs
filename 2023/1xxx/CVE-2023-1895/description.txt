The Getwid â€“ Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery via the get_remote_content REST API endpoint in versions up to, and including, 1.8.3. This can allow authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
