But there is no function to cancel tx_sim_timer\nin ene_remove(), the timer handler ene_tx_irqsim() could race\nwith ene_remove(). As a result, the UAF bugs could happen,\nthe process is shown below.\n\n    (cleanup routine)          |        (timer routine)\n                               | mod_timer(&dev->tx_sim_timer, ..)\nene_remove()                   | (wait a time)\n                               | ene_tx_irqsim()\n                               |   dev->hw_lock //USE\n                               |   ene_tx_sample(dev) //USE\n\nFix by adding del_timer_sync(&dev->tx_sim_timer) in ene_remove(),\nThe tx_sim_timer could stop before ene device is deallocated.\n\nWhat's more, The rc_unregister_device() and del_timer_sync()\nshould be called first in ene_remove() and the deallocated\nfunctions such as free_irq(), release_region() and so on\nshould be called behind them. Because the rc_unregister_device()\nis well synchronized. Otherwise, race conditions may happen. The\nsituations that may lead to race conditions are shown below.\n\nFirstly, the rx receiver is disabled with ene_rx_disable()\nbefore rc_unregister_device() in ene_remove(), which means it\ncan be enabled again if a process opens /dev/lirc0 between\nene_rx_disable() and rc_unregister_device().\n\nSecondly, the irqaction descriptor is freed by free_irq()\nbefore the rc device is unregistered, which means irqaction\ndescriptor may be accessed again after it is deallocated.\n\nThirdly, the timer can call ene_tx_sample() that can write\nto the io ports, which means the io ports could be accessed\nagain after they are deallocated by release_region().\n\nTherefore, the rc_unregister_device() and del_timer_sync()\nshould be called first in ene_remove().\n\nSuggested by: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>\n\nFixes: [9ea53b7](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9ea53b74df9c4681f5bb2da6b2e10e37d87ea6d6) (\"V4L/DVB: STAGING: remove lirc_ene0100 driver\")\nSigned-off-by: Duoming Zhou <duoming@zju.edu.cn>\nSigned-off-by: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@kernel.org>\n```\n\n* Loading branch information\n\n[![@stonezdm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12294548?s=40&v=4)](/stonezdm) [![@mchehab](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6566927?s=40&v=4)](/mchehab)\n\n[stonezdm](/torvalds/linux/commits?author=stonezdm \"View all commits by stonezdm\")\nauthored and\n[mchehab](/torvalds/linux/commits?author=mchehab \"View all commits by mchehab\")\ncommitted\nFeb 8, 2023\n\n1 parent\n[3004081](/torvalds/linux/commit/30040818b338b8ebc956ce0ebd198f8d593586a6)\n\ncommit 29b0589\n\nShowing\n**1 changed file**\nwith\n**2 additions**\nand\n**1 deletion**.\n\n* Whitespace\n* Ignore whitespace\n\n* Split\n* Unified\n\n## There are no files selected for viewing\n\n3 changes: 2 additions & 1 deletion\n\n3\n[drivers/media/rc/ene\_ir.c](#diff-30078867c667d27be475af308d67db8479a6699052ea64f05a696eacfd3389a0 \"drivers/media/rc/ene_ir.c\")\n\nShow comments\n\n[View file](/torvalds/linux/blob/29b0589a865b6f66d141d79b2dd1373e4e50fe17/drivers/media/rc/ene_ir.c)\nEdit file\n\nDelete file\n\nThis file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the `ene_ir` remote control driver's `ene_remove()` function. The timer handler `ene_tx_irqsim()` might race with `ene_remove()` during device detachment. Additionally, the order of function calls within `ene_remove()` was flawed, leading to potential use-after-free issues and other race conditions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition",
      "Improper resource handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Use-after-free bugs can lead to denial of service (system crash) or memory corruption. The race conditions could cause the device driver to access freed resources, leading to unpredictable behavior and possible system instability. Additionally, the rx receiver could be inadvertently re-enabled, the irqaction descriptor might be accessed after deallocation and IO ports could be accessed after deallocation",
    "Attack vectors": "A race condition between the cleanup routine when unbinding the device, and the timer routine that uses the device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local system access and ability to trigger the unbinding of the `ene_ir` remote control driver, specifically by triggering device detach events. An attacker also must be able to open /dev/lirc0, insert and remove USB devices, and have access to io ports."

A local\n    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource\n    exhaustion).\n\nCVE-2023-1076\n\n    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the TUN/TAP\n    network driver, which results in all TUN/TAP sockets being marked\n    as belonging to user ID 0 (root).  This may allow local users to\n    evade local firewall rules based on user ID.\n\nCVE-2023-1077\n\n    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the task\n    scheduler.  A local user might be able to exploit this to cause a\n    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n    privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-1078\n\n    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the RDS protocol\n    implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial\n    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege\n    escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-1079\n\n    Pietro Borrello reported a race condition in the hid-asus HID\n    driver which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to\n    insert and remove USB devices can use this to cause a denial of\n    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary\n    code in the kernel.\n\nCVE-2023-1118\n\n    Duoming Zhou reported a race condition in the ene_ir remote\n    control driver that can lead to a use-after-free if the driver\n    is unbound.  It is not clear what the security impact of this is.\n\nCVE-2023-1281, CVE-2023-1829\n\n    \"valis\" reported two flaws in the cls_tcindex network traffic\n    classifier which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user can\n    exploit these for privilege escalation.  This update removes\n    cls_tcindex entirely.\n\nCVE-2023-1513\n\n    Xingyuan Mo reported an information leak in the KVM implementation\n    for the i386 (32-bit PC) architecture.  A local user could exploit\n    this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.\n\nCVE-2023-1611\n\n    \"butt3rflyh4ck\" reported a race condition in the btrfs filesystem\n    driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could\n    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-1670\n\n    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the xirc2ps_cs network\n    driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to\n    insert and remove PCMCIA devices can use this to cause a denial of\n    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary\n    code in the kernel.\n\nCVE-2023-1855\n\n    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the xgene-hwmon hardware\n    monitoring driver that may lead to a use-after-free.  It is not\n    clear what the security impact of this is.\n\nCVE-2023-1859\
