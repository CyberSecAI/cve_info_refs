Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-1190.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in a heap-buffer-overflow read in the `imageinfo` program when parsing image metadata. Specifically, a crafted input file can cause an out-of-bounds read due to an incorrect offset calculation while reading box sizes in a loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow read: The program reads beyond the allocated buffer while parsing metadata. The vulnerability occurs in a lambda function called by `_M_invoke`, which reads a `boxSize` from the input, and uses this size to iterate the data. If the `boxSize` is manipulated such that the offset goes beyond the buffer, a heap-buffer-overflow read happens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash/Denial of Service: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing the program to crash. This could result in a denial of service if the vulnerable program is part of a larger system.
- Potential further exploitation: While the provided information only describes a crash, heap-based memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted input file: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specifically crafted image file as input to the `imageinfo` program.
- The attacker can manipulate the size of the image metadata boxes to cause an out-of-bounds read, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to the `imageinfo` program. This might be through a file upload or any other means that allows the program to process attacker-controlled files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and further investigated using GDB. The crash occurs at `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/imageinfo/imageinfo.hpp:498`, which corresponds to reading a `boxSize` from the input.
- The provided GDB output shows a crash caused by an invalid memory access due to reading at `[rax + rcx * 1]`, where the values are manipulated to be out-of-bounds of the input buffer.
- The vulnerable code is within a loop that reads metadata boxes, and the size of the box (`boxSize`) is read directly from the input, allowing manipulation.
