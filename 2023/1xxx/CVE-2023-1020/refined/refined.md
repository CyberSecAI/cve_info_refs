- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`last_timestamp`) before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `shoutbox-ajax-update-messages` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically by using a tool like Burp Suite or similar.
