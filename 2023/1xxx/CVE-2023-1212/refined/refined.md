Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when saving and displaying user widget settings on the dashboard. Specifically, the `wtitle` and `wfile` fields are not being properly sanitized before being displayed in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the widget settings. This code is then stored in the database. When the affected page is loaded, the stored malicious script is executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when the dashboard is viewed by other users.
*   **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the victim's session leading to account takeover
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information displayed on the dashboard.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Widget Settings:** The primary attack vector is through the user widget settings, specifically the `wtitle` and `wfile` fields.
*   **Database Storage:** Malicious input is stored in the database.
*   **Dashboard Rendering:** When the dashboard page is rendered the unsanitized input from the database is included in the HTML, resulting in the execution of the malicious javascript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to modify widget settings.

**Technical Details (from the commit diffs):**

*   **`app/dashboard/index.php`:** This file shows that the `wtitle` and `wfile` fields, which are part of the user widget settings, are being output to the HTML without proper escaping in lines 159 and 169.
    *   `print " <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-".escape_input($wdet['wsize'])." widget-dash' id='w-".escape_input($wdet['wfile'])."'>";`
    *   `if($wdet['whref']=="yes") { print "<a href='".create_link("widgets",$wdet['wfile'])."'> <h4>".\_(escape\_input($wdet['wtitle']))."<i class='fa fa-external-link fa-gray pull-right'></i></h4></a>"; }`
    *   `else { print "<h4>".\_(escape\_input($wdet['wtitle']))."</h4>"; }`
    *   `print " <div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6' id='w-".escape_input($c)."'>";`
*   **`functions/classes/class.Common.php`:** This file shows the addition of `object` to the list of banned elements, but this change is not related to the XSS vulnerability in widget settings, which uses `escape_input()` rather than `noxss_html()`.
*   **`misc/CHANGELOG`:** Confirms that this commit is fixing a stored XSS vulnerability in user widget settings.

In summary, the commit addresses a stored XSS vulnerability by using `escape_input()` when outputting the `wtitle` and `wfile` fields, preventing the execution of malicious JavaScript code within the dashboard.
