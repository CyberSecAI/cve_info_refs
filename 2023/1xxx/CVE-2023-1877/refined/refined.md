The provided content is a commit diff from Github and a generic footer from huntr.dev. The commit diff shows changes to a file named `XSS.php` which seems to address XSS vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is related to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate sanitization of user input within the Microweber application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The code change attempts to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities by:
   - Using a `$clean->clean($input)` method which is likely an HTML sanitization function
   - Encoding blade curly braces ( `{{` and `}}` ) to prevent injection of blade directives.
   
**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Arbitrary script execution in users' browsers
    - Cookie stealing
    - Data theft
    - Website defacement

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious user input that is not properly sanitized before being rendered on the webpage

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into user input fields that are processed by the Microweber application.
- The attacker could also try to inject blade directives if the encoding of the braces is not done properly in the application.

**Additional Notes:**
The commit message "update" is not very informative. Also, the actual implementation details of the `$clean->clean($input)` method are not visible from this diff, so it is unknown how effective this mitigation is.
The encoding of curly braces is a good step, but more information is needed if it is done correctly.

This information relates to a vulnerability that could be present in the application and not the CVE, so:
NOINFO
