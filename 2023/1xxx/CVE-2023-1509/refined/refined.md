**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce validation in the `gmace_manager_server` function, which is called via the `wp_ajax_gmace_manager` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the absence of nonce validation on a sensitive AJAX action.
- Arbitrary File Modification (Creation/Overwrite/Deletion) due to insecure file management functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker manages to inject malicious code into a file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a forged request leveraging the CSRF vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing a similar action that triggers the forged request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a site administrator into performing an action that triggers the forged request.
