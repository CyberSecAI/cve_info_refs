Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `id` GET parameter in the `/php-mts/app/medicines/view_details.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability. Specifically, it is a classic case of a GET parameter (`id`) being directly used in an SQL query without adequate sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data.
- The content shows evidence of both Union Based SQLi and Time Based SQLi
    - The first payload demonstrates a Union Based SQLi that injects a string `QRSTA a b c d`
    - The second payload demostrates a Time Based SQLi by injecting a sleep command that causes the server to respond in 15 seconds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
- Access sensitive data stored in the database.
- Modify or delete data.
- Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system via the database.
- Perform further attacks using the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the HTTP GET parameter `id` in the URL `/php-mts/app/medicines/view_details.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application, which is 192.168.0.100, as shown in the provided content. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
