**CVE-2023-1655 analysis**

The provided content shows a commit related to a bug fix, specifically addressing issue #2425 in the `gpac/gpac` repository. This commit modifies two files:

1.  `src/filters/reframe_rawpcm.c`
2.  `src/utils/bitstream.c`

The changes in `src/filters/reframe_rawpcm.c` appear to address a situation where the filter could get stuck or misbehave if it didn't find the expected "wave data chunk" within a certain number of bytes. The fix seems to be:
   - Adding a check `if (!hdr_found)` to handle cases where the header is not found before checking `ctx->probe_data_size`. This prevents reading and dropping packets incorrectly.
   - Adding a log message when no wave data chunk is found.
   - Ensuring the packet is dropped if the size of the probe data is less than or equal to 10000 bytes and a wave data chunk has not been found.

The changes in `src/utils/bitstream.c` adds a check to prevent overflowing the `bs->position` when skipping bytes. The code now includes:
   -   `if (bs->position > bs->size) { bs->position = bs->size; bs->overflow_state = 1; }`

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause seems to stem from a lack of proper handling when parsing a raw PCM stream, specifically when the expected "wave data chunk" is not found within a given byte limit. This could cause issues in the filter state machine which would cause the program to either read packets incorrectly, or get stuck in a loop waiting for the missing chunk. Another issue was that the bitstream skip function could cause an overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation/Handling:** The original code did not handle the absence of the expected "wave data chunk" correctly, which resulted in incorrect behavior.
    *   **Integer Overflow:** The `gf_bs_skip_bytes` function in `bitstream.c` could result in an overflow if the number of bytes to skip was larger than the remaining size of the buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The original code could have lead to several issues. The bitstream overflow in `gf_bs_skip_bytes` could lead to reading outside of the buffer or crashing the program if it is used in other functions. The incorrect handling of missing "wave data chunk" would cause incorrect processing of audio data. The program could get stuck if the data never appears.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Attack vectors involve providing a malformed or crafted audio/video file that does not include a "wave data chunk" header where the program expects it, or uses a bitstream that causes the overflow when skipping bytes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide the program with crafted media input files.

**Summary of changes:**

*   The fix in `reframe_rawpcm.c` ensures that if the header is not found, and data size is less than a threshold, it will drop the packet, avoiding a potential loop or crash scenario. The fix also includes added logging for easier debugging.
*   The fix in `bitstream.c` prevents an overflow when skipping bytes, ensuring that the position never exceeds the size of the buffer and sets the overflow state.

This analysis provides a good understanding of the bug and the fixes.

**Note:** While this is not a complete CVE description, it is enough to establish that this commit is relevant to a vulnerability within `gpac` and should be investigated further.
