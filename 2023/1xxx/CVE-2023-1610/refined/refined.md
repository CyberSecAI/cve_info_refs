Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `com.build.web.project.ProjectTaskController#taskList()` method. This method constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
- Specifically, the application uses `StringsEscapeUtils.escapeSql()` to process input, but this method is insufficient to prevent SQL injection bypass.
- The user-controlled input is concatenated directly into the SQL query string in `com.rebuild.web.project.ProjectTaskController` at line 122.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code is injected into the application's SQL query.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to sanitize input with `StringsEscapeUtils.escapeSql()`, but it is not sufficient to prevent the injection. The vulnerability occurs because of the string concatenation of user input with the SQL query, bypassing the escaping mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query.
- The provided example payload shows how an attacker could potentially extract database table names.
- Full database compromise can potentially be achieved by using more advanced SQL injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request to the `/project/tasks/list` Endpoint:** The attack vector is through a POST request to the `/project/tasks/list` endpoint of the application.
- **`search` Parameter:** The `search` parameter in the request is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `/project/tasks/list` endpoint and that the `search` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be capable of creating SQL injection payloads that bypass the application's sanitization attempts.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code exists in the `rebuild` project and affects version `<=3.2.3`.
- The vulnerability was reported on March 19, 2023, and was marked as closed on March 20, 2023.
- The identified vulnerable parameter is `search`.
