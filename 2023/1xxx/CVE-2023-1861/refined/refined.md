- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape usernames when outputting them in the logs dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the logs, which will be executed when an administrator views the logs. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or modifying website content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious code via the username field, which is stored in the plugin's logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to trigger the vulnerability.
