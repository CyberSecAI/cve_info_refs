- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF protection in an AJAX action accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated arbitrary user metadata update.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation by changing user metadata, potentially leading to an unauthenticated attacker setting themselves as an administrator of the blog.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability without needing any specific privileges.
