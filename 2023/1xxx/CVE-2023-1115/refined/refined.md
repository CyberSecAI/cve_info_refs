Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Relevance to CVE-2023-1115:**

The provided content does not contain any information related to CVE-2023-1115. The content from GitHub shows a commit related to optimizing a dialog in the pimcore project, and includes a fix involving sanitizing HTML attributes, but no mention of any specific vulnerability. The huntr.dev content is generic website information.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The provided content does not contain information about the root cause of any specific vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - The GitHub content shows a commit that addresses missing sanitization of the `attributes` field in `models/Document/Editable/Link.php`. This suggests a potential vulnerability prior to the fix, likely an XSS issue if attributes were not properly escaped, but this is an assumption based on the fix.
    -   Specifically, before the patch, the `this->data['attributes']` was not being sanitized. This could allow users to inject malicious code via these attributes.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - In the commit, the fix uses `htmlspecialchars`, indicating that the impact of not sanitizing user input could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application that would execute when a user views the affected content.
   - However, without an official CVE description, it's hard to make a definitive claim on impact without a thorough security assessment, or a confirmed CVE entry.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector would be through user-controlled input in the `attributes` field within the `models/Document/Editable/Link.php` context, which, if not sanitized, would allow for injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker would need the ability to manipulate the `attributes` of a link within the Pimcore system. This might require having editing rights or exploiting an existing vulnerability to modify the attributes.

**Summary:**

The content shows a commit that implements sanitization to prevent what likely was a cross-site scripting vulnerability in pimcore. However, there is no mention of CVE-2023-1115 in the content.
