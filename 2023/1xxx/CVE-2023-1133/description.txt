Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions prior to 1.0.5 contain a vulnerability in which the Device-status service listens on port 10100/ UDP by default. The service accepts the unverified UDP packets and deserializes the content, which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.
