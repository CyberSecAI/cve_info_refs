  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not ensure that posts to be accessed via a shortcode are already public and can be viewed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control, allowing access to draft posts by unauthorized users.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access the content of draft posts, which are not intended to be public.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using the `parse-media-shortcode` action and a shortcode containing the ID of the draft post to access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber."
