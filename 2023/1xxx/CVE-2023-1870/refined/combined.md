Es el mejor plugin que he encontrado para poner videos de youtube en mi pagina.
El servicio de asistencia es con diferencia el mas atento que me he encontrado hasta hoy.
Un placer

Lo compré para un proyecto de una web de un cliente de mi empresa y solo puedo hablar cosas buenas de él. Lo compramos la versión pro, me parece precio muy razonable, muy útil para integrar canales de youtube a la web, con multitud de opciones. Y el soporte funciona de 10, rápidos y resolutivos.

Does exactly what it says on the tin. I added this plugin to display a youtube playlist on my website without all of YouTube’s extra branding, which clutters the page a lot. It worked a treat. Also, I had a minor issue that I couldn’t figure out and the support guys were right on it, responding to my query quickly and helping me sort it. very impressed.

Unfortunately this plugin/business is a scam. We have paid for the pro version and never received the license key or email confirmation. Support isn’t answering emails.

YourChannel is a wonderful plugin. It’s by far the most responsive and versatile YouTube plugin I’ve used. And easy to use. Their customer support is absolutely top notch and as a bonus it’s super affordable. Thank you to their entire team. They and their plugin in are a standout in the Wordpress ecosystem.

### Description

The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the saveLang function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin's quick language translation settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
