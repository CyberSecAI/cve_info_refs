Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `saveLang` function of the YourChannel WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper nonce validation on the `saveLang` function. Nonce is a security token used to verify that the request originated from the expected source and not a malicious site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the plugin's language translation settings by crafting a malicious request. If a logged-in administrator is tricked into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a specially crafted webpage, the attacker's request to change the language settings will be executed.
