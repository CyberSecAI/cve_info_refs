**CVE-2023-1875 Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The commit message "fix: added missing conversion to HTML entities" indicates that the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input, specifically the `display_name` and `last_modified` fields before they are used in the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core issue is the absence of HTML entity encoding before displaying user-provided data. This lack of encoding means that if a malicious user includes HTML or JavaScript code in these fields, the code will be rendered/executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful attack could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This can have severe consequences, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of pages, and potential phishing attempts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the user input fields for `display_name` and `last_modified` within the administrative user management interface of phpMyFAQ. An attacker needs to inject malicious code into these fields.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have the privileges to modify or create user profiles within the application. It appears to target admin-level users.

**Summary of the fix:**

The fix involves adding `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` to the filtering process for both `display_name` and `last_modified` fields. This filter converts special characters, such as `<` and `>`, into their respective HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`), preventing the injected code from being interpreted as HTML.

The vulnerability was found and fixed in phpMyFAQ, which has been identified in the github content.
