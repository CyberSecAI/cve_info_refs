Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-1081:

**Analysis:**

The provided content shows a commit to the `microweber/microweber` repository on GitHub. The commit message indicates "fix of [#990](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/issues/990)".  The code diff shows the addition of several `on*` attributes (e.g. `onauxclick`, `onbeforecopy`, `onbeforecut`, etc.) to the list of event attributes that are being sanitized by the `XSSClean.php` file.

This suggests a potential vulnerability related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where these new event handlers could have been used to inject malicious scripts.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided HTML content, specifically related to event handler attributes. The original `XSSClean.php` class likely had a filter that was missing these `on*` event attributes.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.  The absence of these `on*` attributes in the sanitization filter allowed attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code through HTML attributes such as `onclick`, `onmouseover` etc.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
    *   Steal cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Deface the website.

*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML containing the unsanitized event attributes into fields that are parsed and displayed on the web page, such as blog posts, comments, or other user-generated content.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML content into a vulnerable input. This may or may not require prior authentication, depending on the vulnerable input.

**Summary**

The commit fixes a potential XSS vulnerability by adding more event handler attributes to the sanitization logic in `XSSClean.php`. Before this change, these attributes could have been used to inject malicious Javascript.
