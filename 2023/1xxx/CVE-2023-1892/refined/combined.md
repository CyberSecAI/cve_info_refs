[@mperham](https://github.com/mperham), great job fixing this. The CVE was published via huntr.dev with incorrect affect range. I posted comment on <https://huntr.dev/bounties/e35e5653-c429-4fb8-94a3-cbc123ae4777/>. I'm not sure if you are able to change the affected range to `>=7.0.4, < 7.0.8`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
