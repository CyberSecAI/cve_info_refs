The provided content details a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Health Center Patient Record Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `hem_id` GET parameter within the `hematology_print.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `hem_id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Cookie theft (as demonstrated with the `document.cookie` payload).
    - Session hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing the webpage.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `hem_id` parameter.
- The attacker tricks a user into clicking this malicious link.
- The server reflects the malicious payload in the response.
- The victim's browser executes the attacker's script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to load the crafted URL in their browser. This may be done via social engineering or other phishing attacks, as well as via malicious links on other websites.
