{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The integrated Grafana server, which shares the same origin as the GitLab instance, allows users with admin access in Grafana to configure data sources that can forward whitelisted cookies to an external server. This allows an attacker to steal GitLab session cookies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Grafana server allows whitelisting cookies which are forwarded during requests.",
      "Grafana is hosted on the same origin as GitLab, allowing access to GitLab cookies.",
      "Lack of proper input validation or sanitization on whitelisted cookies within Grafana, allowing for the inclusion of sensitive cookies like `_gitlab_session`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can steal GitLab session cookies, leading to session takeover and full access to the victim's account.",
    "attack_vectors": "A Grafana admin can configure a data source to an attacker-controlled server and whitelist the `_gitlab_session` cookie. Any user visiting a Grafana dashboard using this data source will have their GitLab session cookie sent to the attacker's server.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires admin access to the Grafana instance (not GitLab admin access). They also need control of an external server to receive stolen cookies."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "vulnerable_component": "Integrated Grafana server in GitLab omnibus package",
        "attack_flow": "1. Attacker gains admin access to Grafana.\n2. Attacker configures a data source pointing to an attacker-controlled server.\n3. Attacker whitelists the `_gitlab_session` cookie in the data source configuration.\n4. Victim visits a dashboard that uses the malicious data source.\n5. Victim's `_gitlab_session` cookie is forwarded to the attacker's server.\n6. Attacker uses the stolen cookie to gain access to the victim's GitLab account.",
        "note": "The report mentions an older version of Grafana is packaged in Omnibus and might be susceptible to CVE-2022-39201, which has a similar issue of whitelisting the `grafana_session` cookie."
