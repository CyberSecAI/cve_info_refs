{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeSql` method, intended to prevent SQL injection, is bypassed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The attacker could also gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `/files/list-file` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `q` parameter of a GET request.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/files/list-file` endpoint of the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided content, but it's implied based on the request headers"
  },
  "affected_component": "/files/list-file interface, com.rebuild.web.files.FileListController#listFile() method",
  "affected_versions": "<=3.2.3"
