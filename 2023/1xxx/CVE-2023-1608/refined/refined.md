- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cateId` parameter from the `/api/admin/store/product/list` endpoint is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability due to direct string concatenation of user-controlled input (`cateId` parameter) into SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/api/admin/store/product/list` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code via the `cateId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application. No specific position is required. The attacker needs to have access to the `/api/admin/store/product/list` endpoint.
