Hide comment

After implementation we have 3 comments and errors:

1. Existing enumset value is chosen for IP. Save. Result=Empty (does not save the value and leaves it as blank)
2. Previous enumset from 1.4.5 was ''value1','value2','value3''. Now it is converted to '''value1'',''value2'',''value3''' after upgrade.
3. If the enumset is modified/updated, it cannot be saved.

   A) Required field = True, Version = 1.5.2

   B) Change: added one more enum value. Click Save.

   Error:

   SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1067 Invalid default value for 'custom\_field1'. Failed to edit field

Sorry, something went wrong.
