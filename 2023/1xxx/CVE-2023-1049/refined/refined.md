- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper control of code generation, also known as code injection. This allows for execution of malicious code when a user loads a project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code). This vulnerability allows for code injection through project files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could result in unauthorized code execution, potentially leading to loss of availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the workstation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is loading a malicious project file from the local file system into the HMI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious project file that can be loaded by a user of the software. The user would need to open the file locally on the workstation running the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The user needs to be tricked to open a malicious file.
