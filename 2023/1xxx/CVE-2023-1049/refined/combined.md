Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-1049

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability exists that
could cause execution of malicious code when an unsuspicious user loads a project file from the
local filesystem into the HMI.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Use the project “Set up Password” feature to protect the project file.
•  Encrypt project files when stored and restrict the access to only trusted users.
•  When exchanging files over the network, use secure communication protocols.
•  Only open project files received from trusted source, and it is recommended to share

project files only when configured with the encryption feature.

•  Use EcoStruxure™ Operator Terminal Expert and Pro-face BLUE software in a secure

network environment.

•  Use EcoStruxure™ Operator Terminal Expert and Pro-face BLUE software only on a

trusted workstation.

•  Harden your workstation following the best cybersecurity practices (antivirus, updated

operating systems, strong password policies, application whitelisting software, etc.) using
the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
