- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in admin's browser by enticing them to open a specially crafted page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered when a logged-in admin visits a page with the malicious code, which submits a form with an XSS payload in the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious page containing a form that targets the vulnerable plugin and convince a logged-in administrator to visit this page.
