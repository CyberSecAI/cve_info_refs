  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in a response of an AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious AJAX request that includes a payload in the 'wd_args' parameter. An attacker could make a logged in admin open a page with malicious code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into opening a page or URL that submits the malicious request, exploiting the vulnerable AJAX action."
