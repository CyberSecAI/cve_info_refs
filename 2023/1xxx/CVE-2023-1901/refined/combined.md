# HCI send\_sync Dangling Semaphore Reference Re-use

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published

Jul 10, 2023

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

<= 3.3

## Patched versions

None

## Description

## Summary

The bluetooth HCI host layer logic not clearing a global reference to a semaphore after synchronously sending HCI commands may allow a malicious HCI Controller to cause the use of a dangling reference in the host layer, leading to a crash (DoS) or potential RCE on the Host layer.

## Description

To send an HCI command synchronously, the HCI stack involves different functions for its synchronization:

1. `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync` creates a local semaphore variable (which gets allocated on the stack of `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync`) and stores a reference to this local semaphore variable in the global `cmd_data` array via `cmd(buf)->sync`: <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/9a75902/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c#L325>
2. `hci_cmd_done`, which is called while handling sending completion (via the reception of matching completion or status priority HCI events, or in certain error cases), checks whether the reference to this synchronization semaphore is set, and optionally giving/releasing the semaphore: <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/9a75902/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c#L2102>
3. To support asynchronous sending, `bt_hci_cmd_create` initializes `cmd(buf)->sync` to `NULL` while a command buffer is initially created.

The issue of this way of handling synchronous sending of HCI commands lies in the fact that while handling the completion, the reference to the synchronization semaphore is not cleared (`hci_cmd_done` uses `cmd(buf)->sync`, but never clears the reference).

This implementation works correctly as long as the HCI Controller layer always sends completion/status priority events only once for each synchronously-sent command, or delays sending it enough such that the corresponding command buffer is correctly re-initialized and the semaphore reference is valid again.

The implementation causes a stale reference to the application stack memory to be used as a semaphore, however, if the Controller layer sends a second completion event for the same command before it is re-initialized for sending a new HCI command. In this situation, the pointer stored in `cmd(buf)->sync` has first been used as expected, and indicated to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync` that the transmission is completed. As a result, `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync` returns and releases its local variables in the process. Another function re-claims the stack space for its own local variables, and overwrites the contents in the location which `cmd(buf)->sync` still references. When the second completion event is sent by the malicious/malfunctioning Controller layer, the reference stored in `cmd(buf)->sync` still references the invalidated stack memory, such that this reference is used via `k_sem_give(cmd(buf)->sync);` (<https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/9a75902/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c#L2104>). In this situation, arbitrary data may reside in the affected memory location (which may or may not be attacker-controllable), and may be wrongly used as a pointer to a `k_sem` structure in a call to `k_sem_give`.

## Impact

A malicious / malfunctioning HCI Controller may cause a dangling reference to be used as a semaphore object in the host layer, resulting in a crash (DoS) or potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Bluetooth host layer.

## Proposed Fix

To avoid this issue, when receiving HCI responses to synchronously sent HCI commands (`cmd(buf)->sync` is not NULL), the HCI logic should ensure that the semaphore reference in `cmd(buf)->sync` is (atomically) cleared and will not be re-used while handling another HCI response.

For example, `hci_cmd_done` could (atomically) read `cmd(buf)->sync` and NULL the reference after retrieving it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
