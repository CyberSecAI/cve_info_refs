Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly references CVE-2023-1263 and describes an information exposure vulnerability in the "CMP â€“ Coming Soon & Maintenance" WordPress plugin, aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the `cmp_get_post_detail` function within the plugin. This function allows retrieval of post/page content.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Information Exposure:** The core vulnerability is that the `cmp_get_post_detail` function doesn't properly check authentication or permissions, allowing unauthorized access to post/page content.
   - **Bypass of Maintenance Mode:** Even when the plugin is in maintenance mode, which is designed to restrict access to the site, this function still exposes content.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can access the content of any published posts or pages that are not password protected. This could lead to the exposure of private information or content that was intended to be hidden during maintenance.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Direct Function Call:** An attacker can directly call the vulnerable `cmp_get_post_detail` function. This is possible via the WordPress AJAX API.
   - The `wp_ajax_cmp_get_post_detail` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_cmp_get_post_detail` hooks are vulnerable.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
   - **Knowledge of the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to know the existence and purpose of `cmp_get_post_detail` function in order to call it correctly, such as through the correct WordPress AJAX hook.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in plugin versions up to and including 4.1.6.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marco Wotschka from Wordfence.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.1.7 and later of the plugin.
