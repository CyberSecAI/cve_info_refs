Add a check for empty report_list in hid_validate_values().
The missing check causes a type confusion when issuing a list_entry()
on an empty report_list.
The problem is caused by the assumption that the device must
have valid report_list. While this will be true for all normal HID
devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.

We found potential misuses of list_entry() on lists in hid driver
code that are not checked.
Issuing a list_entry() on an empty list causes a type confusion making
the list_entry point to the list_head itself.
The most impactful seems the missing check for an empty list in
hid_validate_values() which is supposed to check the validity of the
reports themselves, potentially affecting all the drivers that rely on it.

The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the device must
have valid report_list. While this will be true for all normal HID
devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.

This patch fixes the issue by checking that the lists are nonempty
before allowing them to be used.

At a first glance it may seem that the patches have security implications.
However, when plugging a device which provides a descriptor with no output
report, the type confusions will create a fake struct hid_report*
which points to ((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type].report_list.
This, by chance, makes the type confused structure to span
the `struct hid_report* report_id_hash[256]` array in the
((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type] field.

Then, due to their semantics hid_validate_values() will check
(report->maxfield > field_index) on the type-confused report,
and the maxfield field happens to overlap on the
report_id_hash[] array in the report_enum[type] field
which are all NULL since we provided no reports.
Similarly, for bigben_probe(), the confused report entry is
used in the bigben_worker() function which checks
(report->field[0] != NULL) that, again, overlaps with a NULL
pointer.
It seems there is a commit (918aa1ef104d: "HID: bigbenff: prevent
null pointer dereference") which added the check for report_field
being NULL to bigben_worker() to prevent crashing, but without
checking the actual root cause.

Thus, while being type confusions bugs, they are not exploitable.
I still believe list checks should be added, and the patches on
hid_validate_values() and bigben_probe() merged,
to prevent future exploitability if the shape of the structure changes,
and they do not overlap anymore with NULL pointers.
In this case, it is not exploitable just by the pure chance of struct
member ordering.

Subject: Linux Kernel: hid: NULL pointer dereference in hid_betopff_play()

Hi all,

I'm disclosing a possible DoS when plugging in a malicious USB device,
which advertises itself as a betop USB device.

A device driver must check that the device correctly registered the
expected inputs and reports.
Otherwise, a malicious USB device may violate assumptions throughout
the driver's code.

betopff_init() in the betop driver's code only checks that the device advertises
at least 4 report values among all its fields, but hid_betopff_play() expects
at least 4 report fields with a value each.
A device advertising an output report with one field and 4 report values
would pass the check but crash the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference
in hid_betopff_play(), when accessing `betopff->report->field[2]->value[0]`.

Best regards,
Pietro Borrello

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2173403#c0)  Alex    2023-02-26 12:50:52 UTC  ``` A flaw found in the Linux Kernel. The missing check causes a type confusion when issuing a list_entry() on an empty report_list. The problem is caused by the assumption that the device must have valid report_list. While this will be true for all normal HID devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.

HID: betop: check shape of output reportsbetopff\_init() only checks the total sum of the report counts for each
report field to be at least 4, but hid\_betopff\_play() expects 4 report
fields.
A device advertising an output report with one field and 4 report counts
would pass the check but crash the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference
in hid\_betopff\_play().

Debian Bug     : 825141

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2022-2873

    Zheyu Ma discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in
    the Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller driver may result in
    denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-3424

    Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang reported a flaw in the SGI GRU driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  On systems where this driver
    is used, a local user can explit this for denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3545

    It was discovered that the Netronome Flow Processor (NFP) driver
    contained a use-after-free flaw in area_cache_get(), which may
    result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-3707

    Zheng Wang reported a flaw in the i915 graphics driver's
    virtualisation (GVT-g) support that could lead to a double-free.
    On systems where this feature is used, a guest can exploit this
    for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4744

    The syzkaller tool found a flaw in the TUN/TAP network driver,
    which can lead to a double-free.  A local user can exploit this
    for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-36280

    An out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability was discovered in the
    vmwgfx driver, which may allow a local unprivileged user to cause
    a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-41218

    Hyunwoo Kim reported a use-after-free flaw in the Media DVB core
    subsystem caused by refcount races, which may allow a local user
    to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2022-45934

    An integer overflow in l2cap_config_req() in the Bluetooth
    subsystem was discovered, which may allow a physically proximate
    attacker to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-47929

    Frederick Lawler reported a NULL pointer dereference in the
    traffic control subsystem allowing an unprivileged user to cause a
    denial of service by setting up a specially crafted traffic
    control configuration.

CVE-2023-0045

    Rodrigo Branco and Rafael Correa De Ysasi reported that when a
    user-space task told the kernel to enable Spectre v2 mitigation
    for it, the mitigation was not enabled until the task was next
    rescheduled.  This might be exploitable by a local or remote
    attacker to leak sensitive information from such an application.

CVE-2023-0266

    A use-after-free flaw in the sound subsystem due to missing
    locking may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-0394

    rawv6_push_pending_frames() in the network subsystem allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2023-0458

    Jordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found that getrlimit() and
    related system calls were vulnerable to speculative execution
    attacks such as Spectre v1.  A local user could explot this to
    leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2023-0459

    Jordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found a regression in
    Spectre v1 mitigation in the user-copy functions for the amd64
    (64-bit PC) architecture.  Where the CPUs do not implement SMAP or
    it is disabled, a local user could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel.  Other architectures may also be
    affected.

CVE-2023-0461

    "slipper" reported a flaw in the kernel's support for ULPs (Upper
    Layer Protocols) on top of TCP that can lead to a double-free when
    using kernel TLS sockets.  A local user can exploit this for

CVE-2023-23559

    Szymon Heidrich reported incorrect bounds checks in the rndis_wlan
    Wi-Fi driver which may lead to a heap buffer overflow or overread.
    An attacker able to insert and remove USB devices can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    information leak, or possibly to run arbitrary code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-25012

    Pietro Borrello reported a race condition in the hid-bigbenff HID
    driver which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to
    insert and remove USB devices can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary
    code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-26545

    Lianhui Tang reported a flaw in the MPLS protocol implementation
    that could lead to a double-free.  A local user might be able to
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibl for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-28328

    Wei Chen reported a flaw in the az6927 DVB driver that can lead to
    a null pointer dereference.  A local user permitted to access an
    I²C adapter device that this driver creates can use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-28466

    Hangyu Hua reported a race condition in the kernel TLS socket
    implementation which can lead to a use-after-free or null
    pointer dereference.  A local user can exploit this for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    This feature is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2023-30456

    Reima ISHII reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for Intel
    CPUs affecting nested virtualisation.  When KVM was used as the L0
    hypervisor, and EPT and/or unrestricted guest mode was disabled,
    it did not prevent an L2 guest from being configured with an
    architecturally invalid protection/paging mode.  A malicious guest
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

HID: check empty report\_list in hid\_validate\_values()Add a check for empty report\_list in hid\_validate\_values().
The missing check causes a type confusion when issuing a list\_entry()
on an empty report\_list.
The problem is caused by the assumption that the device must
have valid report\_list. While this will be true for all normal HID
devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.

Subject: Linux Kernel: hid: type confusions on hid report_list entry

Hi all,

We found potential misuses of list_entry() on lists in hid driver
code that are not checked, specifically hid_validate_values() in
drivers/hid/hid-core.c and bigben_probe() in drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c.
Issuing a list_entry() on an empty list causes a type confusion making
the list_entry point to the list_head itself.
The most impactful seems the missing check for an empty list in
hid_validate_values() which is supposed to check the validity of the
reports themselves, potentially affecting all the drivers that rely on it.

The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the device must
have a valid report_list. While this will be true for all normal HID
devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.

At a first glance, it may seem that the patches have security implications.
However, when plugging a device which provides a descriptor with no output
report, the type confusions will create a fake struct hid_report*
which points to ((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type].report_list.
This, by chance, makes the type confused structure to span
the `struct hid_report* report_id_hash[256]` array in the
((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type] field.

Then, due to their semantics hid_validate_values() will check
(report->maxfield > field_index) on the type-confused report,
and the maxfield field happens to overlap on the
report_id_hash[] array in the report_enum[type] field
which are all NULL since we provided no reports.
Similarly, for bigben_probe(), the confused report entry is
used in the bigben_worker() function which checks
(report->field[0] != NULL) that, again, overlaps with a NULL
pointer.
It seems there is a commit (918aa1ef104d: "HID: bigbenff: prevent
null pointer dereference") which added the check for report_field
being NULL to bigben_worker() to prevent crashing, but without
checking the actual root cause.

Thus, while being type confusions bugs, they are not exploitable.
The list checks should be added also to prevent future exploitability
if the shape of the structure changes (e.g., structure layout
randomization), and they do not overlap anymore with NULL pointers.
In this case, it is not exploitable just by the pure chance of struct
member ordering.

This post has been written in accordance with linux-distros rules to
which we disclosed the initial findings of the potential vulnerabilities.
as even if the bugs seem not exploitable, the wider community on
oss-security might see how the issue does have security relevance.

We submitted patches to fix the issue by checking that the lists
are non-empty before allowing them to be used:

which points to ((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type].report_list.
This, by chance, makes the type confused structure to span
the `struct hid_report* report_id_hash[256]` array in the
((struct hid_device *)hid).report_enum[type] field.

Then, due to their semantics hid_validate_values() will check
(report->maxfield > field_index) on the type-confused report,
and the maxfield field happens to overlap on the
report_id_hash[] array in the report_enum[type] field
which are all NULL since we provided no reports.
Similarly, for bigben_probe(), the confused report entry is
used in the bigben_worker() function which checks
(report->field[0] != NULL) that, again, overlaps with a NULL
pointer.
It seems there is a commit (918aa1ef104d: "HID: bigbenff: prevent
null pointer dereference") which added the check for report_field
being NULL to bigben_worker() to prevent crashing, but without
checking the actual root cause.

Thus, while being type confusions bugs, they are not exploitable.
The list checks should be added also to prevent future exploitability
if the shape of the structure changes (e.g., structure layout
randomization), and they do not overlap anymore with NULL pointers.
In this case, it is not exploitable just by the pure chance of struct
member ordering.

This post has been written in accordance with linux-distros rules to
which we disclosed the initial findings of the potential vulnerabilities.
as even if the bugs seem not exploitable, the wider community on
oss-security might see how the issue does have security relevance.

We submitted patches to fix the issue by checking that the lists
are non-empty before allowing them to be used:

HID: check empty report\_list in bigben\_probe()Add a check for empty report\_list in bigben\_probe().
The missing check causes a type confusion when issuing a list\_entry()
on an empty report\_list.
The problem is caused by the assumption that the device must
have valid report\_list. While this will be true for all normal HID
devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the assumption.
