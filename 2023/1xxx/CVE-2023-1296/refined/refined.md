- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nomad ACL system failed to block access to a workload's own variables even when a `deny` ACL capability was applied.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent ACL enforcement. Specifically, the `deny` ACL capability was ineffective in restricting access to a workload's own variables. The ACL system silently failed to block access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A workload could access its own variables even when the ACL policy was set to deny access. This could lead to unexpected behavior and security issues if not properly accounted for.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious workload (or a compromised workload) could potentially bypass ACL restrictions and access variables it should be denied from accessing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be running a workload on Nomad, and have the ability to access that workload's variables. The attacker does not need any special privileges, as the issue is that the ACLs do not deny access.
