- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Redirection plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for its uninstall action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability, specifically, the absence of CSRF checks in the `ir_uninstall` action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to unknowingly delete all the redirection rules configured on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious link or web page, which when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers the vulnerable action. The proof of concept URL is provided as `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?action=ir_uninstall`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a request that a logged-in administrator will unknowingly execute, which triggers the uninstall action. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
