    "git.kernel.org_e8707933_20250114_200233.html": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The commit introduces support for IORING_OP_CLOSE in io_uring. It implements the close operation, removing the file descriptor and posting completion inline. The actual file put operation is offloaded to an asynchronous context. The async part of the work is marked as uncancellable to guarantee the close operation will complete.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code initially split the close operation into two steps to handle cases where a flush operation couldn't be safely performed from a non-blocking context. The operation would be marked as uncancellable if punted to async. This introduced complexity.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially exploit the logic flaw in the initial implementation of IORING_OP_CLOSE that handles the file closing in two stages with an uncancellable async component. Although it does not explicitly describe a direct exploit, the handling of this operation could lead to issues due to the uncancellable flag and its separation into two stages. ",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the io_uring interface, by using the IORING_OP_CLOSE operation.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to utilize the io_uring interface to trigger the vulnerable code path. It requires the ability to call the IORING_OP_CLOSE operation."
    },
    "git.kernel.org_2bd5d4b8_20250114_200233.html": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "This commit removes the intermediate IORING_OP_CLOSE stage. It combines the file descriptor lookup and flush check into one atomic operation using __close_fd_get_file(), which eliminates the need for splitting the close operation into two steps, and the IO_WQ_WORK_NO_CANCEL flag.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability was present in the original approach of splitting the close operation into two stages and the need for IO_WQ_WORK_NO_CANCEL. By grabbing the files lock in close_fd_get_file(), the need to split the close was removed.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could lead to a file remaining in an indeterminate state if the operation was cancelled before completing the second stage of the close operation. This could potentially lead to resource leaks or other issues.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the io_uring interface, by using the IORING_OP_CLOSE operation that was split into two steps in the original flawed code.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to utilize the io_uring interface to trigger the vulnerable close operation and potentially cancel the operation in between the two steps of the close, as well as the capability of calling the IORING_OP_CLOSE operation."

   "git.kernel.org_3edf6e6a_20250114_200232.html": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "This commit imports the io_uring codebase from 5.15.85 to the stable branch, wholesale. The changes involve dropping some features not present in 5.10 and adjusting calling conventions.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "This commit itself doesn't introduce a vulnerability, but imports the io_uring code that was vulnerable in previous versions and which were fixed by commits such as b5dba59e and 9eac1904.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "This commit by itself does not contain any vulnerability information. It is used to import the io_uring feature to the stable branch. Hence no direct impact of exploitation.",
        "Attack vectors": "N/A",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "N/A"

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple NetApp products use Linux kernel versions prior to 5.12-rc2 which are susceptible to a vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The NetApp advisory indicates a vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 5.12-rc2. It mentions exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). The specific vulnerability details from the kernel patches are not mentioned here.",
