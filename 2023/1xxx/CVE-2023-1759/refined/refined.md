Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inconsistent sanitization of user-supplied input in the phpMyFAQ application. Specifically, the code initially filters input using `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW` and then immediately overwrites it with the result of `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS`.  This effectively removes the raw input and replaces it with sanitized content. In most cases, this is the desired behavior, however, the inconsistency of initially using FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW can be misleading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The main vulnerability is the potential for developers to believe that input has already been sanitized due to the initial `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW` call, especially if they don't look closely at subsequent operations. There is no direct vulnerability stemming from this code, but there is a potential for misuse/misunderstanding and incorrect implementation of input sanitization in the future. There is no evidence from this commit that suggests a successful exploit of this weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Since the code immediately sanitizes the data, there is no direct impact of exploitation from this commit. There is a potential impact if a developer modifies this code and assumes that the data is not sanitized, resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

There is no clear attack vector given that the unsanitized input from FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW is immediately overwritten by the result of FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS. There is a potential vulnerability if a developer modifies the code to remove the sanitization call. The attack vector could be malicious user input via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker would need to be an authenticated user able to submit content through the web interface of the phpMyFAQ application. There is no vulnerability stemming directly from the existing code provided, but there is a potential vulnerability due to the structure of the code itself.

**Summary**

The provided commit fixes an inconsistency in input sanitization, ensuring user input is properly sanitized before use. The commit changes the filter from `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW` to `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` for several input fields. While the code does not present a vulnerability, a developer could potentially misuse the code in the future by assuming the data was not sanitized and introduce a vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

The commit diffs show changes in three files:
- `phpmyfaq/admin/record.add.php`
- `phpmyfaq/admin/record.edit.php`
- `phpmyfaq/admin/record.save.php`

These files are related to adding, editing, and saving FAQ records, respectively. The vulnerability exists within all three files.
