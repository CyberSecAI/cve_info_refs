Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the `apiRun.php` file of OTCMS version 6.72. The provided images suggest the vulnerability lies within the handling of user-supplied input within a URL. The specific input and how it is processed are not explicitly shown in the text, however the images indicate that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a URL parameter.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data before including it in the HTML output.
*   **Vulnerable File:** The identified vulnerable file is `apiRun.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
*   This code can then be executed within the context of a user's browser session, allowing for:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing cookies or other sensitive data
    *   Potentially other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable parameter within a URL. The provided screenshots indicate that a URL query parameter is vulnerable.
*   **User Interaction:** The injected script is executed when a user visits the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick or convince a victim into visiting the malicious URL, this can be done by phishing for instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability details are provided with images of the vulnerable code and exploit. This suggests the vulnerability is likely a reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   The specific location within `apiRun.php` where the vulnerability exists is not given, but the provided screenshots help in visualizing the general vulnerability.
*   The CVE description is a placeholder. Therefore, the provided document contains more vulnerability details than what is specified in the CVE.
