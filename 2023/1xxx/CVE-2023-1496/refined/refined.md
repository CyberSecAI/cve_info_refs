The provided content relates to a commit that fixes a vulnerability in `imgproxy`. Specifically, it addresses the sanitization of the `use` tag within SVG files.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of `use` tags in SVGs, potentially allowing for the inclusion of external resources or scripts via `href` or `xlink:href` attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Unsanitized `use` tags in SVG files.
-  Specifically, the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of the `use` tag were not being properly checked to ensure they are not referencing external resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The commit message indicates sanitization to prevent the usage of external resources. Without this sanitization, an attacker might be able to load malicious external resources or execute JavaScript if the context allows for it, leading to potential XSS or other injection attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file with a `use` tag that contains an `href` or `xlink:href` attribute pointing to an external resource, which could be an executable script or an image.
- When processed by a vulnerable `imgproxy` instance, the malicious SVG would cause the external resource to be loaded, potentially leading to malicious code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload or have the victim process a malicious SVG through `imgproxy`.
- No special user level access to imgproxy is needed, just the ability to send the malicious SVG to the service for processing.

**Additional details from the commit:**

- The fix involves checking for `href` and `xlink:href` attributes within the `use` tag. It specifically checks if the attribute value is not empty and doesn't start with `#`. If these conditions are met, the attribute is ignored during processing, thus preventing the external resource from being loaded.
- The code change modifies the `svg/svg.go` file by adding a check within the `xml.AttributeToken` case to look for `use` tags, and then check if they contain a `href` or `xlink:href`.
