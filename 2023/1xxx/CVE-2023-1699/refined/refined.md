- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability in the Security Console allowed attackers to force browsing of administration pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to administrative pages of the Security Console.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive administrative functionalities, leading to unauthorized configuration changes, data exposure, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not clearly specified beyond "forcing browsing", but it suggests a method of bypassing access controls to reach admin pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need network access to the Security Console, and the ability to exploit the vulnerability through a method that forces browsing.
