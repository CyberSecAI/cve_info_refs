Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a bypass of file upload restrictions in IBOS OA v4.5.5. The system prevents direct uploads of `.php` files but doesn't adequately filter or prevent the upload of `.htaccess` files.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient file type validation: The application checks for the `.php` extension but not for the `.htaccess` extension.
    *   Lack of proper file content sanitization: It allows for the upload of files containing malicious content (specifically `.htaccess` directives) that can be interpreted by the webserver.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By uploading a crafted `.htaccess` file, an attacker can redefine how the web server interprets other files. The specific exploit uses the `.htaccess` file to instruct the server to treat `.gif` files as executable PHP code, allowing for arbitrary code execution. This leads to a complete system compromise (getshell).

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   File upload functionality: The primary attack vector is the web application's file upload mechanism.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs access to the file upload functionality of IBOS OA v4.5.5. This likely requires being a logged-in user with the right permissions.
    *   The attacker also needs to be able to upload files and also subsequently access them through the web server.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **`.htaccess` Upload:** The attacker uploads an `.htaccess` file with the following content:
    ```
    <FilesMatch ".(gif)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
    ```
    This configuration directive instructs the Apache web server to treat any `.gif` file as a PHP script.
2.  **`.gif` Upload:** The attacker then uploads a `.gif` file containing malicious PHP code:
    ```php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
3.  **Code Execution:** By accessing the uploaded `.gif` file through a web browser (e.g., `http://target/upload/1.gif`), the server executes the PHP code within it, thus gaining code execution.
