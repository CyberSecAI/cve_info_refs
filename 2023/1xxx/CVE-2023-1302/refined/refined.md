The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the File Tracker Manager System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/file_manager/normal/borrow1.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to:
  - Steal cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Deface the website.
  - Access sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `id` parameter of the `/file_manager/normal/borrow1.php` page.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate and distribute a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to click the link.
