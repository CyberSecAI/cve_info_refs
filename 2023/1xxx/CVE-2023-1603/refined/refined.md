The provided content is related to CVE-2023-1603.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue with how Devolutions Server handles entry permissions during import or synchronization within the User vault. Specifically, an ID collision allows a user with restricted access rights to bypass existing entry permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Permission bypass vulnerability.
- Improper handling of entry IDs during import/synchronization operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with restricted access can bypass intended permissions for entries in the User vault.
- This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or modification of configurations/credentials stored within the vault.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the import or synchronization of entries within the User vault.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker requires restricted access rights within Devolutions Server.
- The attacker needs to be able to import or synchronize entries.
- The attacker needs to create an ID collision during the import or synchronization process.
