Based on the provided information, this commit relates to a change in how captcha verification is handled in the Apache Answer project.  Specifically, it modifies the `VerifyCaptcha` function to delete the captcha after retrieving it. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit itself is not introducing a vulnerability, but rather *addressing* a potential one related to captcha handling. The original code, prior to this commit, would retrieve a captcha for verification but not delete it after retrieval. This could allow the same captcha to be used multiple times, potentially circumventing the intended protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of single-use captcha:** Prior to the changes, the captcha could be reused if not deleted after the first verification attempt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially bypass captcha verification by reusing a previously obtained captcha.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could intercept or obtain a captcha and then resubmit it multiple times for verification if it is not deleted after the initial retrieval.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or obtain a valid captcha and resubmit the same captcha multiple times if the captcha is not deleted after its first verification attempt.

**Details from the Commit:**

The commit focuses on changes in two files:

1.  **`internal/repo/captcha/captcha.go`:** The `DelCaptcha` function was added to facilitate the removal of a captcha after it has been used.
2.  **`internal/service/action/captcha_service.go`:** The `VerifyCaptcha` function was modified to call `DelCaptcha` after successfully retrieving the captcha and before returning.

This commit ensures that after a captcha is retrieved for verification, it is deleted, making it a single-use verification.
