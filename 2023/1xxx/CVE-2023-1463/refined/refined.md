The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, related to a fix for "CWE-285: Improper Authorization". This commit modifies how user logout is handled, suggesting a fix for an authorization bypass vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The original code used the `user_id` parameter in the `logout.php` script to identify the user to log out. This could be potentially manipulated, leading to unauthorized logouts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The vulnerability stems from relying solely on the `user_id` parameter for logout, which could be easily forged or manipulated to log out other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially log out legitimate users by manipulating the `user_id` parameter in the logout URL. This could lead to denial of service for the affected users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted logout URL containing a `user_id` parameter of a targeted user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL, to trigger the vulnerable logout process.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to log out another user.

**Detailed changes and their impact**

*   **`error.php`:**
    *   Replaced the `user_id` parameter in the logout link with `token` parameter, using the session key. This change ensures that logouts are now linked to user session instead of a simple user ID

*   **`includes/core/load.js.php`:**
    *   Replaced `user_id` with `token` when performing logouts, ensuring consistency with the updated logout process.

*   **`includes/core/logout.php`:**
    *   Modified the logout logic to include a `token` parameter, allowing logout based on either the `user_id` or a user `token`. The query was changed to `id=%i || key_tempo=%s`. This likely corresponds to the token to improve user logout authentication.

*   **`install/css/install.css`:**
    *   Removed some CSS declarations which do not seem related to the vulnerability.

*   **`install/upgrade.php`:**
    *   Added HTML code for displaying database settings. This change is not directly related to the identified authorization issue.

**Summary of the fix:**

The core of the fix involves switching from using `user_id` to `token` based logouts, which likely maps to session keys. This makes it harder for an attacker to forge a logout request for another user. The database query used to invalidate user sessions were also changed to reflect this.
