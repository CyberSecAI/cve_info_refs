Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in
Ethernet Communication Extension Unit (GC-ENET-COM) of GOC35 Series

Release date: March 31, 2023

Last update date: March 31, 2023

Mitsubishi Electric India Pvt. Ltd.

  Overview

Mitsubishi Electric India is aware of a  Denial-of-Service  ( D o S )   vulnerability in Ethernet communication Extension
unit (GC-ENET-COM) of GOC35  series  due to signal handler race condition (CWE-364).  If  a  malicious attacker
sends specially crafted packets, communication error may occur and then may result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
condition. (CVE-2023-1285)

  CVSS

CVE-2023-1285  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,

Base Score:7.5.

  Affected products

Extension unit GC-ENET-COM fixed in the COM 1 slot of all versions of GOC 35 Main unit..

Affected product version is as shown below.

No.

Unit

Model Name

Serial Number

1

COM Extension unit  GC-ENET-COM

16XXXXXXXXX
(First 2 digits of 11-digit serial number of unit are “16”
and indicate product version)

Refer to serial number label on the left side of Extension unit GC-ENET-COM as shown below.

Serial number is shown as
SN: 16XXXXXXXXX

  Description

When Extension unit GC-ENET-COM is configured as Modbus TCP Sever and receives a large number of specially
crafted packets from an attacker to any UDP port, it will not be able to process Modbus communication due to signal
handler race condition (CWE-364)  that occurs between Interrupt Service routine and processing code of extension
unit, so falls into Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

Communication resumes only if the power of the Main unit is switched off and on or hot swapping of Extension unit
GC-ENET-COM from Main unit.



Impact

A malicious attacker may cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) of Modbus TCP communication.

  Countermeasures

Firmware of Extension unit GC-ENET-COM which first 2 digits of 11-digit serial number of unit are “17” has been
fixed.

Firmware update in Extension unit GC-ENET-COM is possible at factory only. Please contact your local Mitsubishi
Electric India representative.

  Mitigations

Mitsubishi  Electric  India  recommends  that  customer  should  take  the  following  mitigations  to  minimize  the  risk  of
exploiting this vulnerability if the mentioned countermeasures cannot be implemented.

1.  Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when internet access is

required.

2.  Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network

to restrict access from untrusted networks and hosts.

3.  Restrict physical access to your computer and network equipment on the same network.

  Acknowledgement

Mitsubishi Electric India would like to thank Faruk Kazi and Parul Sindhwad from COE-CNDS lab, VJTI, Mumbai,
India, who reported the vulnerability.

  Contact information

Please contact your local Mitsubishi Electric India representative.

  Update history

March 31, 2023.

First release.
