- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's import functionality executes arbitrary SQL queries based on user-provided input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to improper sanitization/validation of user-provided SQL files during the import process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database. As demonstrated in the Proof of Concept, this could allow an attacker to modify site configurations or potentially gain full control of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's import functionality under "Advanced settings". An attacker uploads a malicious SQL file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard.
