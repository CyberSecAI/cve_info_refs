## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# HTTP Headers < 1.18.8 - Admin+ SQL Injection

### Description

This plugin has an import functionality which executes arbitrary SQL on the server, leading to an SQL Injection vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create an SQL file with the following contents:
UPDATE wp\_options SET option\_value = "Hacked" WHERE option\_name = "blogname"
2. As an admin user within WP Admin, navigate to Settings > HTTP Headers > Advanced settings.
3. In the "Import" section, click on "Choose file..." and select the SQL file created above.
4. Click "Import settings".
5. Navigate to "Settings" in the sidebar and notice that the "Site Title" has been changed to "Hacked".
