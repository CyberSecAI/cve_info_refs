*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption in the logging feature of Devolutions Gateway.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The logging mechanism in Devolutions Gateway versions 2023.1.1 and earlier does not properly handle the volume of log data, allowing an attacker to fill up the disk space.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial of service (DoS) by rendering the system unusable due to the disk being full.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker sends specially crafted requests to the Devolutions Gateway which are then logged. The content doesn't specify whether these are legitimate or malicious requests. The specific type of requests is not specified.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or need to authenticate. They need to be able to send requests to the gateway. The attacker does not require any user interaction and can initiate the attack remotely over the network.
