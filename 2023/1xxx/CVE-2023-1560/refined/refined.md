The provided content relates to CVE-2023-1560.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `TinyTIFFReader_readNextFrame` function within the `tinytiffreader.c` file of the TinyTIFF library. This occurs due to an issue within a `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (program abort) due to a crash caused by the buffer overflow

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable application. This could occur through a file upload, by tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or other file-handling mechanisms.
