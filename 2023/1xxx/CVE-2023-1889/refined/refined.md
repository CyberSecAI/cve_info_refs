**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-1889

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** in the `listing_task` function of the Directorist plugin. This function lacked proper validation and authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `listing_task` function directly uses a user-supplied post ID to perform actions without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action on the specified post.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or higher can delete arbitrary posts on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   The vulnerability is in the `listing_task` function which is accessible via HTTP requests.
*   By manipulating the `task` and `taskdata` parameters, the attacker could trigger the arbitrary post deletion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `listing_task` function within the Directorist plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions that **CVE-2023-35052 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.5.5 of the plugin by adding a check to ensure that the current user has the necessary permissions before deleting a post.
*   The patch also includes some sanitization of input data in other parts of the plugin.
