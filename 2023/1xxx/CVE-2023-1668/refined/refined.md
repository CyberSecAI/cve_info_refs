  "CVE-2023-1668": {
    "description": "Open vSwitch is vulnerable to crafted IP packets with ip proto set to 0, potentially causing a denial of service.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fast Datapath 9",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fast Datapath (for RHEL Server for IBM Power LE) 9",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fast Datapath (for IBM z Systems) 9",

       "Red Hat Virtualization Host 4 for RHEL 8"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The ofproto layer treats the nw_proto field as both an indication that a proper nw layer exists and the value contained in the header, which is incorrect behavior according to relevant standards. This leads to the omission of complete action lists when nw_proto is 0.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of IP packets with protocol field set to 0.",
           "Flow rules containing 'set' actions on other fields in the IP protocol header causing a failure to mask the IP protocol field, resulting in a large flow rule bucket which captures all IP packets."

      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). Incorrect handling of IP packets, potentially leading to connectivity breakage with other traffic on the link.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending crafted IP packets with the protocol field set to 0, with flow rules containing set actions on other fields in the IP protocol header.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted IP packet with protocol field set to 0, and influence the flow rules to include 'set' actions on other IP protocol header fields.  No authentication or privilege is required, and it appears to be exploitable remotely. "
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by blocking packets with network protocol number '0' before they reach Open vSwitch, or by creating high priority flow rules to drop these packets. The vulnerability affects all versions of Open vSwitch starting from 1.5.0",
