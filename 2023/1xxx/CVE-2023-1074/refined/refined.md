    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a type confusion in the `inet_diag_msg_sctpasoc_fill()` function within the SCTP diag module. Specifically, when an SCTP socket is bound to an address like `::1` (localhost IPv6) with scope ID 0, and then a connection is attempted to an address with a different scope (e.g., loopback interface's link-local address `fe88::1`), the function attempts to copy addresses usable for the connection's scope. However, if no addresses matching the connection's scope are found, the resulting address list is empty. Subsequent processing by `list_entry()` then accesses memory using a type-confused pointer, as it assumes the list isn't empty.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Type confusion due to unchecked empty list during address copy in SCTP connection handling, leading to an attempt to read from uninitialized or wrong memory.",
        "The SCTP implementation doesn't properly handle the case where no suitable bound addresses are found for the connection's scope."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization) leak by triggering the type confusion. This leak occurs because the code attempts to read and return a value `laddr.v6.sin6_addr` from the type confused pointer, which is an incorrect memory location and overlaps with a `struct sctp_endpoint *ep` pointer within the `struct sctp_association`.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker who can bind an SCTP socket with a specific configuration and then attempt to connect to another address with an unmatching scope, thus creating the condition with empty address list.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to create and manage SCTP sockets and initiate network connections are needed to exploit this vulnerability."
