- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape numerous of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users (like admin) can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected settings or pages. This could lead to arbitrary actions on the victim's browser and session.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting a malicious payload into the "Your Company or Website Name" settings of the plugin and saving, the XSS is triggered. All settings are affected by this lack of sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges such as admin access to the WordPress dashboard.
