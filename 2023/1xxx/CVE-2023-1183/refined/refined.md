Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1183:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions `CVE-2023-1183`, along with its description "libreoffice: Arbitrary file write" and  "Apache OpenOffice: Arbitrary file write in Apache OpenOffice Base".  This clearly indicates a relationship with the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice process embedded databases in their .odb file format using the bundled HSQLDB library. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the parsing of the database/script file where a malicious SCRIPT command can be used to write to an arbitrary file path.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Arbitrary File Write**: The primary vulnerability is the ability to write data to a file at a location of the attacker's choosing.
   -**Unsafe Handling of Script Commands**: The SCRIPT command within the database script is not properly sanitized or restricted, allowing attackers to control the destination of file writes.
  - **Use of vulnerable HSQLDB version**: LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice bundle a vulnerable version of HSQLDB (1.8.0)

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:

  - **Overwrite existing files**: An attacker could overwrite system files, configuration files, or other critical data.
  - **Create new files**: An attacker can write new files containing arbitrary content to the file system.
   - **Potential for code execution**: If the arbitrary file write allows writing to a location where code is executed, an attacker might achieve remote code execution. This is not explicitly stated in the content provided, but a typical impact of arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.
   - **Data Modification or Corruption**: By writing to sensitive files or databases, the integrity of the application and or system could be affected.

**5. Attack vectors:**

  - **Maliciously crafted .odb file**: The primary attack vector is a crafted .odb file containing a malicious "database/script" file.
  - **Database Connection Trigger**: The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable application establishes a database connection to the malicious .odb file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - **Ability to create and distribute .odb files**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious .odb file and get it to a victim. This could be done through phishing, social engineering or by hosting it on an accessible server.
  - **Target must open the crafted .odb file**: The victim must open the malicious .odb file using the affected version of LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice.

**Additional Notes:**

  - The issue was identified by Gregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH.
  - Fred Toussi provided a fix in hsqldb to address the issue
  - Both LibreOffice (7.4.6/7.5.1) and Apache OpenOffice (post 4.1.14) have released updates to patch this vulnerability.
  - RedHat has also addressed the issue through security advisories `RHSA-2023:6508` (RHEL 9) and `RHSA-2023:6933` (RHEL 8)

In Summary, CVE-2023-1183 is a moderate severity vulnerability where an attacker can achieve arbitrary file write by exploiting the SCRIPT command in crafted odb files processed by LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice. This can have wide ranging impact including data corruption, system compromise, and potentially code execution.
