### CVE-2023-1022

Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a **Missing Authorization** vulnerability in the WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress, specifically affecting versions up to and including 4.5.3.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's reliance on nonce checks as the primary means of access control for the `wpmsGGSaveInformation` function. This nonce was accessible to all authenticated users, including those with subscriber-level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `wpmsGGSaveInformation` function lacked a proper capability check, allowing unauthorized users to execute the function.
-   **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin incorrectly assumed that nonce verification alone was sufficient to protect the functionality, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An authenticated attacker with subscriber-level access can update the plugin's google analytics options.
-   This could potentially allow malicious users to modify settings related to google analytics, which would normally be restricted to administrator-level users.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this flaw.
-   The attacker needs to be authenticated, but does not require administrative privileges.
-   An attacker can craft a malicious request using the accessible nonce to modify the options related to Google Analytics

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be authenticated on a WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
-   The attacker requires a basic understanding of how to send a POST request to the WordPress website including the required nonce for the plugin.

**Additional Information:**
-   The Wordfence vulnerability database entry provides additional references to the specific code changes in the plugin that addressed the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.4 of the plugin, which added a capability check to the `wpmsGGSaveInformation` function.
