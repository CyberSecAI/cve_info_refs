### Summary:
This document provides information about a missing authorization vulnerability in the WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wpfc_purgecache_varnish_callback` function in the WP Fastest Cache plugin lacks a capability check, meaning it doesn't verify if the user has the necessary permissions to execute the function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of authorization checks before executing the `wpfc_purgecache_varnish_callback` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with subscriber-level access, to trigger the function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with low-level privileges (subscriber) can purge the Varnish cache. This could lead to:
    - **Disruption:** By repeatedly purging the cache, an attacker could force the server to regenerate the cache frequently, which could slow down the site and impact performance.
    - **Resource Exhaustion:**  If done aggressively, the attacker could potentially exhaust server resources.
    - **Denial of Service:** A more advanced attacker might be able to trigger a denial-of-service by repeatedly purging the cache.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target WordPress site.
- The attack can be performed by sending a crafted request to the `wpfc_purgecache_varnish_callback` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be a registered user of the WordPress site.
- No other specific capabilities are required other than network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.2 and patched in 1.1.3.
- Wordfence blocked 1,730 attacks targeting this vulnerability in a 24-hour period.
- The provided code diff shows a change to add security checks for multiple functions, including `wpfc_purgecache_varnish_callback`.
