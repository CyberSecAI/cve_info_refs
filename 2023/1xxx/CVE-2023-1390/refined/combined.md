## Analysis of the Patch

Looked at this [commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b77413446408fdd256599daf00d5be72b5f3e7c6), there are changes made to the `tipc_link_xmit` function.

When patched, this is printed in dmesg when the POC is run.

```
tipc: Too large msg, purging xmit list 1 5 0 40 4!
tipc: Too large msg, purging xmit list 1 15 0 60 4!

```

These correspond to the two messages sent in the POC. Mapping these out to their assignments in the function

```
# The discovery message
purging xmit list 1 5 0 40 4
  skb_queue_len(list) = 1
  msg_user(hdr) = 5
  msg_type(hdr) = 0
  msg_size(hdr) = 40
  mtu           = 4

# The activate/reset message
purging xmit list 1 15 0 60 4
  skb_queue_len(list) = 1
  msg_user(hdr) = 15
  msg_type(hdr) = 0
  msg_size(hdr) = 60
  mtu           = 4

```

So the MTU is caught here as 4. But why?

Looking at what was added:

Originally the `hdr` was defined as `buf_msg(skb_peek(list))` and was redefined to be a new tipc\_msg struct called `hdr`.

* This is just a 60 byte array that holds the maximum size of a message header. The internal header is 60 bytes, while others are 40.
* This means that the hdr is not blindly cast from the next SKB in the queue.

Now a check is made for `pkt_cnt <= 0` which is defined by the size of the queue of unprocessed packets (skb). If there are no more packets left, or if the number is negative, then return 0.

My hunch is now that the DOS happened because it was trying to parse SKBs that were not there. This [while loop](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/link.c#L1037) may have just sent it into an unknown state due to parsing unknown data in memory.

## Tracing what calls tipc\_link\_xmit

This is just a best guess, kernel tracing needs to be done.

* [tipc\_l2\_rcv\_msg](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/bearer.c#L619) - handle incoming TIPC message from an interface
* [tipc\_rcv](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L2137) - process TIPC packets/messages arriving from off-node
* [tipc\_node\_link\_up](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L892) - handle addition of link. This calls a wrapper too: [\_\_tipc\_node\_link\_up](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L859)
* [tipc\_link\_add\_bc\_peer](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/link.c#L352) - add a peer node to broadcast link and bearer
* [tipc\_link\_build\_bc\_init\_msg](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/link.c#L2326) - synchronize broadcast link endpoints.
* [tipc\_link\_xmit](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/link.c#L996) - Consumes the buffer chain of messages

## Analyzing the MTU assignment

The MTU being set to a low value is one part of this, but it could be indicative of a bigger issue.

Let's see what calls it and how connections are initialized:

`tipc_accept(struct socket *sock, struct socket *new_sock, int flags, bool kern)` [accepts](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/socket.c#L2724) new connections.
This function then calls `tipc_sk_finish_conn(new_tsock, msg_origport(msg), msg_orignode(msg));`. [tipc\_sk\_finish\_conn](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/socket.c#L1642) connects the socket to the peer.

This function is acting on a [tipc\_sock](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/socket.c#L96) struct. The `tipc_sock->max_pkt` member is what is set by calling the `tipc_node_get_mtu` function. This function is [called](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/socket.c#L1659) with `net`, which is the SKB, the `peer_node` passed originally from `tipc_accept` and the `tsk->portid` which a unique TIPC socket port identity.

[tipc\_node\_get\_mtu](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L198) initializes `mtu` with [MAX\_MSG\_SIZE](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/msg.h#L101) which is 66060. A [tipc\_node](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L108) is initialized with `tipc_node_find(net, addr);` It has some checks to ensure that the node is valid and if it's on the same network or not. If all of these checks are passed, then the `bearer_id` gets assigned to `tipc_node->active_links` on Line 217.

This assignment `bearer_id = n->active_links[sel & 1];` uses the `sel` variable which is the `tsk->portid` AND'd with 1. This is because `active_links` is a 2 element array of ints. If the `bearer_id` is valid, then `mtu` is finally assigned to `n->links[bearer_id].mtu;` which is an unknown value. Finally there is a call to [tipc\_node\_put](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10/source/net/tipc/node.c#L309) and the MTU is returned.

### Questions

* What does MTU look like in this call? Does it get changed in any way after? Can use printk to investigate.
* Does the tipc\_node actually point to a real tipc\_node?

## Next Steps

Need to figure out how the trailer data is processed. The trailer data containing MTU info is not dissected by wireshark. In the packet that crashes the kernel, the data is all 0s. In a proper message, there is data in the 8 byte buffer at the end.

The two bytes at 0x2D seem to affect whether or not this bug is triggered. When 0, the warning appears in a patched kernel. When either byte isn't 0, then the warning doesn't appear.

```
0000   4f 40 00 38 40 00 00 00 00 00 80 00 01 00 10 02   O@.8@...........
0010   00 00 00 01 21 50 02 02 01 00 10 02 01 00 10 01   ....!P..........
                                              -----
0020   c0 80 00 00 00 01 70 00 00 55 44 50 31 00 00 00   ......p..UDP1...
0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                           ........

```

Also should debug and set a breakpoint on `tipc_link_xmit` and on `tipc_node_get_mtu` (or even just printk) and check out the values we are interested in. Is the hdr pointing to TIPC data in `tipc_link_xmit`? Where does the tipc\_node point to in `tipc_node_get_mtu`? What is the value of `mtu`?
