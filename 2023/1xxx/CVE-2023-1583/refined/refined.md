- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When fixed files are unregistered in the io_uring subsystem, `file_alloc_end` and `alloc_hint` are not cleared. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference in `io_file_bitmap_get()` if auto index selection is enabled via `IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC`. The vulnerability occurs because the `io_file_bitmap_get` function attempts to use a `bitmap` pointer from `table` which can be NULL if the file tables have been freed but the alloc related variables are still set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Null pointer dereference
    - Improper resource management: File tables are freed, but related allocation range and hint variables are not reset.
-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference). This could lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker needs to trigger the unregistering of fixed files in the io_uring subsystem.
    - The attacker also needs to enable the auto index selection via `IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC`.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to use the io_uring subsystem and control the file registration and unregistration process
