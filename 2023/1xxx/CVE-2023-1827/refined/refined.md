The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` GET parameter of the `/vaccinated/admin/maintenance/manage_location.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `id` parameter into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: An attacker could potentially access sensitive data from the database by crafting specific SQL queries.
- Data manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
- Server-side code execution: In some cases, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server if the database permissions and configuration allow it.
- Denial of Service: The provided example demonstrates a time-based SQL injection by using the `sleep()` function, which can make the server unresponsive and unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests to the `/vaccinated/admin/maintenance/manage_location.php` endpoint.
- The attack vector is the `id` parameter within the query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- No authentication is explicitly required to exploit the vulnerability. The provided requests include a session cookie but this does not appear to be directly relevant to the vulnerability.
