{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `apport-cli` utility, when used to view crash reports, invokes the system's default pager (typically `less`). If `apport-cli` is executed with elevated privileges (via `sudo` or `pkexec`) and the pager is `less`, it does not drop the elevated privileges before invoking `less`. This allows a local attacker to gain root access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege escalation due to improper handling of elevated privileges when invoking the pager.",
      "Lack of privilege dropping before executing external commands in `apport-cli`."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can escalate their privileges to root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local execution of `apport-cli` with `sudo` or `pkexec`.",
      "Exploitation of the default pager (typically less) for shell escape."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Local access to a vulnerable system.",
       "Ability to execute `apport-cli` with `sudo` or `pkexec`."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered when unprivileged users are allowed to execute `sudo apport-cli`, `less` is used as the system pager, and terminal size can be set."
