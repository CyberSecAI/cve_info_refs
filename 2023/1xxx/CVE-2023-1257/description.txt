An attacker with physical access to the affected Moxa UC Series devices can initiate a restart of the device and gain access to its BIOS. Command line options can then be altered, allowing the attacker to access the terminal. From the terminal, the attacker can modify the deviceâ€™s authentication files to create a new user and gain full access to the system.
