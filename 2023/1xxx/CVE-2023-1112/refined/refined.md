- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `upload_name` parameter within the Drag and Drop Multiple File Uploader PRO plugin for Contact Form 7. This parameter is used to specify the folder where uploaded files are stored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize the `upload_name` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences such as `../` into the parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server where the web application is hosted, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones within sensitive directories. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the uploaded file is an executable (e.g. php file) or full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint used by the plugin. The `upload_name` parameter within the multipart form data of the request is the specific attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker only needs to send a crafted POST request to the WordPress site with the vulnerable plugin installed.
