| Checkmk versions & editions | | 2.3.0b1 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk Cloud (CCE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | | --- | --- | | 2.2.0b3 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk Cloud (CCE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | | 2.1.0p26 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | | 2.0.0p35 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | |

Prior to this Werk the symmetric encryption of agent data (if configured) would fail silently if the option "Run agent as non-root user (Linux)" was also set, since these two options are not compatible.
As a result, agent output would be sent unencrypted.

If symmetric encryption is configured, but failing, the agent will now abort immediately and transmit a message about the failure as the only output.

This will then be reported at the *Check\_MK Agent* service of the host, alongside a CRIT status.
