- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incompatibility between symmetric encryption and running the agent as a non-root user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** When both symmetric encryption and "Run agent as non-root user" options were enabled, the encryption failed silently, resulting in unencrypted agent output being transmitted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive agent data could be transmitted unencrypted, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, passive eavesdropping on agent traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Checkmk agent and server. The attacker does not need to have an account or manipulate the agent or the server.

The provided information includes a CVSS score of 3.7 and the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`, which aligns with the potential for information disclosure with a low confidentiality impact, no integrity or availability impact, and requiring a high attack complexity. This information is not present in the official CVE description, which is "PLACEHOLDER".
