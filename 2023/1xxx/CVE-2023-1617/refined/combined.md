Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular test-
ing with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasion-
ally an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product
cyber security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerabil-
ity handling process. This entails validating if the issue is in fact a product issue, identifying root causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide de-
tails on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that min-
imize the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a Cyber Security Advisory should not be mis-
construed as an affirmation or indication of an active threat or ongoing campaign targeting the
products mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the com-
munication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user commu-
nity in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust
we work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information
which is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

CVE-2023-1617

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

The impact of this vulnerability depends on the functionality provided in the visualization. VC4 applica-
tions displaying e. g. process data in a read-only mode may not be abused by this vulnerability impacting
the integrity or availability of the system.

In cases where VC4 applications control system states or alter process data, this vulnerability might be
abused to stop, change parameters, or read system data of the affected system.

B&R recommends calculating the CVSS v3.1 Environmental Score generating an actionable severity rating
for the customer use case.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?

CVE-2019-8277, CVE-2018-20748

An attacker could try to exploit these vulnerabilities by creating specially crafting VNC packages and
sending them to an affected device.

CVE-2023-1617

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating login requests and sending the request to an
affected system node or use this type of login requests to get access using a visualization panel con-
nected to an affected system node.

To exploit the vulnerabilities remotely, this would require that the attacker has access to the system net-
work, by connecting to the network either directly or through a wrongly configured or penetrated fire-
wall, or that the attacker installs malicious software on a system node or otherwise infects the network
with malicious software. Alternatively, an attacker requires to have physical access to visualization pan-
els used to configure and control the operation of the machine. Recommended practices help mitigate
such attacks, see section Mitigating Factors above.

Could the vulnerabilities be exploited remotely?

Yes, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit these vulnerabilities.
Recommended practices include that process control systems are physically protected, have no direct
connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that
has a minimal number of ports exposed.

What does the update do?

The update removes the vulnerabilities by modifying the authentication algorithm and data handling
algorithm in the VNC server used by B&R VC4 visualizations.

When this security advisory was issued, have these vulnerabilities been publicly
disclosed?

CVE-2019-8277, CVE-2018-20748

Yes, these vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed.

CVE-2023-1617

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-ex-
haustive) list of cyber security practices:

–

–

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls
and separate them from any general purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, periph-
eral equipment, and networks.

–  Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-

work other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

–  Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

–  Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

–  Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

–  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Rec-
ognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version availa-
ble. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
