Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `traveller_details.php` file not properly sanitizing or validating user-supplied data before including it in the HTML output. Specifically, the blog post mentions that line 111 of `traveller_details.php` uses `builtin_echo()` to send unvalidated data to the web browser, leading to the execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The application is vulnerable because it takes data from an untrusted source (likely user input via a GET or POST request) and then echoes this data back to the user without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage which the victim's browser will execute when they visit the vulnerable page. This could include:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens to impersonate a user
    - **Redirecting users to phishing sites:** Prompting users to enter sensitive information on a malicious site
    - **Defacing the website:**  Changing the content of the web page
    - **Other client-side attacks:**  Performing actions on the user's behalf

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web request:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code. This code is then reflected back to the user and executed in their browser.
- The specific payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability is `<img src=0 onerror=alert(2)>` which will trigger a JavaScript alert when the image fails to load.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking the link. This might involve social engineering or embedding the malicious link on another website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `admin/traveller_details.php` file.
- The specific line of code is mentioned (line 111), which implies a lack of user input validation/sanitization before outputting to the browser.
