### Summary
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WP Express Checkout WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to 2.2.8. The vulnerability is located in the coupon creation functionality, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being output.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'pec_coupon[code]' parameter when creating or editing coupons.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

### Impact of exploitation
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses the injected page.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or stealing sensitive information.

### Attack vectors
- An authenticated attacker with administrator-level access can inject malicious scripts via the `pec_coupon[code]` parameter when creating or editing coupons.
- Lower privileged users might be able to exploit this if the `Admin Dashboard Access Permission` is set for them to access the dashboard.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least administrator-level access to the WordPress site.
- Alternatively, a lower-privileged user could exploit the vulnerability if they have dashboard access permissions.
