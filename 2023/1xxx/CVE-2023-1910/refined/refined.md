- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient capability check on the `get_remote_templates` function within the Getwid plugin's REST API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization. Authenticated users with subscriber-level permissions or higher can access the vulnerable endpoint, which was intended for higher-level users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Authenticated attackers can flush the remote template cache. Although the cached template information can be accessed, it's not considered sensitive.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `get_remote_templates` REST endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
