## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ruby Help Desk < 1.3.4 - Subscriber+ Ticket Update via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that the ticket being modified belongs to the user making the request, allowing an attacker to close and/or add files and replies to tickets other than their own.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a ticket using a user with Subscriber privileges.
2. Click on "Close Ticket" and intercept the request using an HTTP Proxy (e.g., BurpSuite).
3. Change the value of the "post\_ID" parameter to another existing Ticket ID.
Note: Since the Ticket ID (post\_ID) is an incremental numerical value, it is easy to brute force it and affect all existing tickets.
