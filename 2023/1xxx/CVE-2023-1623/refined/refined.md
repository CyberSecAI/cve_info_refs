Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-1623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Custom Post Type UI plugin does not properly check for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) when sending debug information to a user-supplied email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection for the debug info sending functionality. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an unintended action, specifically sending debug information to an email address of the attacker's choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to send debug information from the WordPress site to an arbitrary email address. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the WordPress installation and its configuration if the debug information contains such data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint within the plugin, triggering the debug information sending functionality using the attacker's email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into visiting a web page containing the malicious HTML.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
- The attacker must know the vulnerable URL structure for sending debug information.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a simple HTML page that includes a form that automatically submits when loaded.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.13.5 of the Custom Post Type UI plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as a low severity issue.
