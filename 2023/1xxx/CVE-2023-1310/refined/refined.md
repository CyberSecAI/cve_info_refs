The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `prof.php` file of an Online Graduate Tracer System written in PHP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `prof.php` file, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/tracking/admin/prof.php` with a crafted `id` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special authentication is needed based on the given example.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The attacker injects SQL code using the following format: `id=1' or '1'='1` or `id=1\*`.
- The example shows the request using a `POST` method with the parameter in the request body.
- The `x-forwarded-for` header is also provided in the example, although not directly related to the vulnerability.
