- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-provided input in its settings, specifically the "Redirect URL" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the vulnerable setting field (e.g. by hovering the input field).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Redirect URL" field of the plugin settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user (e.g., admin) to access the plugin settings page.
