The provided content is a commit diff from the Apache Answer project. The change is in the `GetExcerpt` function within the `internal/schema/tag_schema.go` file.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The change in the `GetExcerpt` function modifies how the excerpt is extracted from the text. The original code used `tr.OriginalText` and the modified code uses `tr.ParsedText`. This change alone is not a vulnerability but an alteration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

There are no immediate vulnerabilities exposed by this commit itself. It's a code modification, not a fix for a vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Since this commit is not addressing a security vulnerability, there is no impact of exploitation directly associated with it. However, the impact of this code change would be that the excerpt of the tag would be extracted from the parsed text rather than from original text which might introduce unexpected behaviour.

**Attack vectors:**

No attack vector can be identified from this commit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

No specific attacker capabilities are needed, as this is not a vulnerability fix.
