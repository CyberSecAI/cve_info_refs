Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit introduces a change to the `onChange` function within a date field editor in `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/settings/redirects.js`.  The original code was vulnerable because it was possible to inject HTML into the date field, which could lead to an XSS vulnerability. The fix implements a check `Ext.String.hasHtmlCharacters(value)` within the `onChange` function, which prevents the user from inputting HTML, effectively sanitizing user input. If HTML characters are detected, the field is reset using `this.reset()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code via the date field in the redirects settings. If the application did not sanitize the user input, this could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of other users who viewed the affected redirects.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering malicious HTML content in the date field within the redirects settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to access and modify the redirects settings page. This would likely require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
The code change specifically addresses the vulnerability by checking for and preventing HTML characters from being entered into the date field. The commit message "[Task]: Improve redirects" provides a description of the change, and links to the relevant pull request.
