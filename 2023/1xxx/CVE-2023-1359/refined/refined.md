The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Gadget Works Online Ordering System" application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. Specifically, the 'U_NAME' parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database through the vulnerable 'U_NAME' parameter.
- When a user views the user list or other parts of the application where this data is displayed, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser.
- This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the "add user" functionality in the administrative panel.
- The vulnerable parameter is `U_NAME` which is part of a POST request to `/philosophy/admin/user/controller.php?action=add`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator access to the application's admin panel to add a new user.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a POST request with the malicious payload.
