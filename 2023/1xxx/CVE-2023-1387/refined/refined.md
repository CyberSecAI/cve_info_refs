Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-1387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Grafana handles JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication when using the "URL login" feature.
*   When "URL login" is enabled, Grafana looks for the `auth_token` parameter in the URL query string to authenticate users.
*   The issue is that after using the token for authentication to Grafana, it is not removed, and is included as a request parameter when Grafana proxies the request to the data source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of the JWT to the data source. Since the JWT can be used to authenticate to Grafana, the vulnerability allows for potential access to Grafana.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** Grafana does not sanitize or remove the `auth_token` parameter before forwarding the request to the data source.
*   **Configuration Issue:** While the "URL login" feature itself is not inherently insecure, the failure to remove the token during proxy requests leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with access to the data source can obtain the leaked JWT and use it to impersonate the authenticated user in Grafana.
*   **Data Exposure:** The leaked token could potentially contain sensitive information itself as it may be an ID token.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised user has higher privileges, the attacker could gain broader access to Grafana resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted request to a Grafana instance with "URL login" enabled.
*   **Data Source Access:** An attacker needs to have access to the data source that Grafana is connecting to, where the JWT will be leaked. This access could be due to a compromised data source or a malicious data source set up by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a data source:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor or control the data source to which Grafana is proxying requests.
*   **Knowledge of a Grafana instance using JWT URL login:**  The attacker needs to target a Grafana instance where the "URL login" feature is enabled.
*   **No Specific privileges within Grafana itself:** It seems that there is no requirement for the attacker to have an account in Grafana since they are impersonating an authenticated user with a leaked JWT.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to log into Grafana via the URL login mechanism.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Grafana version 9.1 and is fixed in versions 9.5.1, 9.5.0, 9.4.9, 9.3.13, and 9.2.17.
*   The CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) in the NetApp advisory is different from the 4.2 (Moderate) in the Github advisory due to different attack complexity and privilege requirements.
*   The NetApp advisory states that none of their products are affected, meaning that they don't expose the vulnerable functionality.
*   The Grafana advisory states that this vulnerability is a token leak to data sources through a request parameter in proxy requests.
*   The github advisory contains a detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability and a proof of concept.
