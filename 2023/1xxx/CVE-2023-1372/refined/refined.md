- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the WH Testimonials plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, potentially leading to user compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**  By exploiting the lack of sanitization and escaping in parameters such as `wh_homepage`, `wh_text_short`, and `wh_text_full`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious scripts.
