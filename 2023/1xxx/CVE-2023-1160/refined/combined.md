|  |  | ## Contributing |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Contributions of any kind are welcome. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Feel free to submit [Github Issues](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/issues) |
|  |  | or [pull requests](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/pulls). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Quick Guide |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The documentation site has [some details](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/guide/under-the-hood.html#documentation) about internals. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### How-To |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo. |
|  |  | \* [Checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) the branch you want to make changes on. |
|  |  | \* Typically, this will be `master`. Note that most of the time, `master` represents the next release of swagger-php, so Pull Requests that break backwards compatibility might be postponed. |
|  |  | \* Install dependencies: `composer install`. |
|  |  | \* Create a new branch, e.g. `feature-foo` or `bugfix-bar`. |
|  |  | \* Make changes. |
|  |  | \* If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug - add a test! |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Prefer adding new test cases over modifying existing ones. |
|  |  | \* Update documentation: `composer docs:gen`. |
|  |  | \* Run static analysis using PHPStan/Psalm: `composer analyse`. |
|  |  | \* Check if tests pass: `composer test`. |
|  |  | \* Fix code style issues: `composer cs`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Documentation |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The documentation website is build from the [docs](docs/) folder with [vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org). |
|  |  | This process involves converting the existing markdown (`.md`) files into static HTML pages and publishing them. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some reference content is based on the existing code, so changes to annotations, attributes and processors will require to re-generate those markdown files: `composer docs:gen`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The actual published content is managed in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/gh-pages) branch and driven by a [publish action](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Useful commands |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### To run both unit tests and linting execute |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer test |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### To run static-analysis execute |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer analyse |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Running unit tests only |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | ./bin/phpunit |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Regenerate reference markup docs |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer docs:gen |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Running linting only |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer lint |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### To make `php-cs-fixer` fix linting errors |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer cs |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Run dev server for local development of `gh-pages` |
|  |  | ```shell |
|  |  | composer docs:dev |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Project's Standards |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* [PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) |
|  |  | \* [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) |
|  |  | \* [PSR-4: Autoloading Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) |
|  |  | \* [PSR-5: PHPDoc (draft)](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc.md) |
