The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/aqpg/users/user/manage_user.php` file, triggered by the `id` GET parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` GET parameter is directly used in a SQL query without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability via the `id` GET parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database)
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data in the database)
    - Data integrity loss
    - Potential complete system compromise
    - Potential Denial of Service by making the database unresponsive

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted GET request to `/aqpg/users/user/manage_user.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They do not require any specific authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to inject SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided content shows successful exploitation with following payloads:
    - `id=-1' union all select null,null,null,concat(0x35363738,0x41424344),null,null,null,null,null,null-- -`
    - `id=1' and 'a'='a`
    - `id=1' and 'a'='b`
- The first payload is a union-based SQL injection used to inject data and verify the vulnerability.
- The second and third payloads are used to test for boolean based SQL injection by causing true and false conditions respectively.
