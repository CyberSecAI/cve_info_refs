| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2173973#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-02-28 14:55:06 UTC  ``` In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.  Upstream patch & commit: [https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220809163402.20227-1-fw@strlen.de/](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220809163402.20227-1-fw%40strlen.de/) <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/580077855a40741cf511766129702d97ff02f4d9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2173973#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-02-28 16:36:29 UTC  ``` This issue was fixed upstream in version 6.0.

netfilter: nf\_tables: fix null deref due to zeroed list head

```
In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error,
nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object.

nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never
placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in
a null dereference:

BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
Call Trace:
 nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
 nf_tables_newtable+0x4bc/0x9bc
 [..]

Its sane to assume that nft_trans_destroy() can be called
on the transaction object returned by nft_trans_alloc(), so
make sure the list head is initialised.
