- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted configuration data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to insecure deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute code within the context of a Toolbox user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access to an HMI.
    - Social engineering attack on an authorized operator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the HMI, or successful social engineering of an authorized user.
