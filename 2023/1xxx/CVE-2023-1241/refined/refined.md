Based on the provided content, here's an analysis in relation to CVE-2023-1241, assuming that this commit is related to the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit `90bfa0dcc7b49482f1d1e31aee3ab073f3c13dd9` changes the `GetExcerpt()` function within `internal/schema/tag_schema.go`. The vulnerability likely stems from the use of `tr.OriginalText` for excerpt generation. The fix changes this to `tr.ParsedText`. This suggests that `tr.OriginalText` might have contained unparsed or untrusted data that could lead to issues like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if used in a context that renders it in HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Potential XSS:** The original implementation used `tr.OriginalText` which might contain user-provided or otherwise untrusted input. If this `OriginalText` was rendered in a web context (e.g., as part of the tag), it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a typical XSS vulnerability.
- **Improper Data Handling:** The change from `tr.OriginalText` to `tr.ParsedText` indicates that the parsing process is designed to sanitize/process the text before it's used, thus preventing the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that could be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the page with the vulnerable excerpt. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of web pages
  - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker would need to inject malicious scripts in a way that these scripts end up in the `tr.OriginalText` field. This could happen by:
  - Submitting a tag with crafted text containing JavaScript payloads.
  - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows for the modification of the `OriginalText` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to influence the content of `tr.OriginalText`. This likely involves user interaction with the system.
- It also requires the system to render the excerpt in a context that is vulnerable to XSS (e.g., in HTML without proper sanitization).

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit message "update GetExcerpt" is very generic and does not provide specific context on the security implications.
- The provided diff shows that the only change is from `tr.OriginalText` to `tr.ParsedText` which confirms that the original code did not sanitize the text before using it for excerpts.
- This detailed explanation assumes the provided code change is indeed related to CVE-2023-1241.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `OriginalText` field when generating excerpts. By switching to the `ParsedText` field, the vulnerability was addressed. This update avoids a potential XSS vulnerability by using sanitized text when generating the excerpt. The attacker would have to inject the malicious script via an input that ends up in the `OriginalText` field.
