Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the GitLab web interface displays information about the commit associated with a tag or release, but when downloading the source code, it retrieves the code from the commit referenced by a merge request head, if a tag with a specific naming pattern (`refs/merge-requests/<ID>/head`) is created that refers to a merge request, which can point to malicious code. This discrepancy between displayed information and actual downloaded code creates the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent Information Display:** The GitLab web interface inaccurately represents the source code that is downloaded, showing a legitimate commit while the actual downloaded code comes from a malicious merge request.
*   **Lack of Integrity Check:** The system does not verify that the displayed commit corresponds to the source code being downloaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can trick users into downloading and executing malicious code by creating a tag with the specific naming pattern that points to a malicious merge request, which they perceive to be benign. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  This vulnerability could be used in supply chain attacks where users rely on the tag or release to deploy code they believe is safe, but it actually contains malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Tag Creation:** The attacker creates a tag with the name pattern `refs/merge-requests/<ID>/head`, where `<ID>` is the ID of a malicious merge request they created.
*   **Web Interface Deception:** The user trusts the information displayed on the GitLab web interface when downloading code from a tag or release.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Developer Permissions:** The attacker needs developer permissions on the repository to create branches, commits, merge requests, and tags.
*   **Knowledge of Git:** The attacker needs to understand how Git tags, branches, and merge requests work to construct the attack correctly.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a tag with the specific naming pattern is created, which is `refs/merge-requests/<ID>/head` and a release is created from this tag.
*   The provided Ruby script demonstrates how the attack can be automated.
*   The provided video shows a proof-of-concept where a user downloads a file they believe is harmless and ends up executing an arbitrary command on their system.
