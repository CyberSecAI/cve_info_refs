The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving position names. Specifically, it allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the 'name' parameter, which is then stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it saves unsanitized user input in the database and then displays it to other users without encoding it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser when they visit the position list page.
- This allows attackers to potentially steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the 'name' parameter when creating a new position in the admin panel.
- The injected script executes when a user visits the positions list page, where the stored data is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator access to the application to create/modify positions.
- They need to be able to create new positions.
