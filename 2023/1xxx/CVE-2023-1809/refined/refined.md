{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin leaks the master key which is used to download password-protected files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive data exposure. The plugin exposes the master key in the `_wpdmkey` parameter, allowing unauthenticated users to download password-protected files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass password protection and download arbitrary password-protected files.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a POST request to `/wp-json/wpdm/validate-filepass` to obtain the `_wpdmkey`. Then, using the `wpdmdl` and `ind` parameters from the download page, and the `_wpdmkey`, the attacker can construct a URL to download the file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no authentication and only needs to be able to access the website."
