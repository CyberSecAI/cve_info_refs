- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `${}` in the MyBatis SQL mapper, which allows for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `searchInfo` parameter used in the `like` clause. The `like '%${searchInfo}%'` syntax directly inserts the user-supplied input into the query without proper sanitization, leading to potential SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. An attacker could potentially gain control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `/admin/getallarticleinfo` endpoint, specifically the `searchInfo` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to access and make requests to the `/admin/getallarticleinfo` endpoint, and be able to manipulate the `searchInfo` parameter with malicious SQL.
