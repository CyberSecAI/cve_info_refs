**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient escaping of user-supplied 'objects' and 'tags' parameters, and a lack of sufficient preparation in the 'update_options' function, as well as the 'refresh' function which runs queries on the same values. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization of input parameters. Specifically, the 'objects' and 'tags' parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries within the `update_options` and `refresh` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to append additional SQL queries into existing queries. This can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request with malicious SQL code in the 'objects' and 'tags' parameters through the WordPress admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator permissions to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the attack may only be practical on configurations where it's possible to bypass `addslashes` due to a nonstandard database character set (e.g., GBK).
