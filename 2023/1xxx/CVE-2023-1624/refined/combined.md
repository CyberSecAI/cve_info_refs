## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPCode Lite < 2.0.9 - Arbitrary Log File Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin has a flawed CSRF when deleting log, and does not ensure that the file to be deleted is inside the expected folder. This could allow attackers to make users with the wpcode\_activate\_snippets capability delete arbitrary log files on the server, including outside of the blog folders

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in user with the wpcode\_activate\_snippets capability open the URL below
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcode-tools&view=logs&wpcode\_action=delete\_log&log=../../delete-me.log
This will make them delete the ~/wp-content/delete-me.log

### Affects Plugins
