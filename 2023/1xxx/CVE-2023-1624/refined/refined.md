- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a flawed CSRF implementation when deleting logs, and it does not validate that the file to be deleted is within the expected directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin does not properly validate the request origin when deleting logs.
    - Path Traversal: The plugin does not sanitize the log file path, allowing deletion of arbitrary files outside the intended log directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in user with `wpcode_activate_snippets` capability to delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing denial of service or data loss.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the path to the target file and convince a logged-in user with the required capabilities to open it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication but requires the user to be logged in with the `wpcode_activate_snippets` capability and to interact with the malicious link.
