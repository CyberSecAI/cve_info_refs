Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1930:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-1930. Both the Wordfence article and the code diff highlight the vulnerability in the `wpfc_clear_cache_of_allsites_callback` function of the WP Fastest Cache plugin, which is the core of this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a **missing authorization check** within the `wpfc_clear_cache_of_allsites_callback` function. This function is responsible for clearing the cache of all sites in a WordPress multisite installation. The code changes in changeset 2893158 address this by adding security checks (`wp_verify_nonce`).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper permission checks before executing the cache clearing operation. This allows any authenticated user, including those with low-level privileges such as subscriber, to trigger the function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Data Deletion (Cache Files):**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to delete the website's cache files. This could lead to:
      - **Performance Degradation:** The website would need to regenerate its cache, causing slower page load times for users.
      - **Temporary Service Disruption:** If the cache is heavily relied upon, this could temporarily impact the website's availability and user experience.
      - **Resource Consumption:** Increased server load due to cache regeneration.
   -  The Wordfence article notes: Wordfence blocked **2,106 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours. This indicates that this vulnerability has been widely targeted.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
   - **HTTP Request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=wpfc_clear_cache_of_allsites` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
   - **Low-Level Access:** The attacker requires only the minimal privileges associated with the subscriber role.

**Additional details:**
   - The Wordfence article explicitly states that "This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to delete caches".
   - The provided code diff shows the specific code changes made to fix the vulnerability. These changes include checking the nonce, which prevents unathorized execution of the function.
   -  The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.2. It was fixed in version 1.1.3.
