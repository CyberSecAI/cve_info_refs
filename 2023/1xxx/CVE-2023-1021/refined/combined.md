## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Amr Ical Events Lists <= 6.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Login as Admin.
2. Go to wp-admin/admin.php?page=manage\_amr\_ical
3. Add the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` in any of the input fields under `General Options `
4. Hit Update and XSS will be triggered.
