Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-1783:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application, OrangeScrum version 2.0.11, does not properly validate HTML content before converting it to PDF. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SSX)**: The primary vulnerability is a server-side XSS. This occurs when the server processes and renders user-supplied data (in this case, HTML) without proper sanitization, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AWS Credentials Leak:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can remotely obtain AWS instance credentials. This means the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the victim's cloud infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Malicious HTML Injection:** An attacker injects malicious HTML into the application, which is then processed and rendered by the PDF generation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the application, as indicated by `PR:L` in the CVSS vector.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application.
*   **No User Interaction Required**: The exploitation does not require any interaction from the victim (`UI:N`).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when the application converts user-provided HTML content into a PDF.
*   The application fails to validate or sanitize this HTML before the conversion process.
*   An attacker can embed malicious HTML, likely including iframe tags or script tags, which can trigger the leak.
*   The provided screenshots illustrate the successful injection of a malicious HTML payload to leak AWS credentials.

**Mitigation:**

*   At the time of the advisory (2023-06-23), there was no official patch available.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Carlos Bello from Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.5, which indicates a "Medium" severity.
