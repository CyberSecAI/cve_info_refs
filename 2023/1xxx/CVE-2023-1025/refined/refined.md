- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will be executed when a user views the affected settings page. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user (admin or similar) and can inject the malicious code via the plugin's settings page, specifically in the "File Description" field, and other text fields on the same page. The XSS is triggered when a user interacts with the field after saving.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Admin or high-privilege user access to the WordPress admin panel.
