Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `wpfc_remove_cdn_integration_ajax_request_callback` function within the WP Fastest Cache plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of proper nonce validation allows an attacker to forge a request to modify CDN settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can modify CDN settings of the affected WordPress site. This could lead to various issues, such as:
    *   Disrupting the website's caching mechanism.
    *   Potentially serving malicious content through manipulated CDN configurations.
    *   Degrading site performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable `wpfc_remove_cdn_integration_ajax_request_callback` function.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into initiating the forged request. This is typically done by:
    *   Embedding the malicious request in a link.
    *   Encouraging the administrator to click the malicious link (e.g. via email or other communication channels).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have a user account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Social Engineering skills**: They need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a link.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted website.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in WP Fastest Cache versions up to and including 1.1.2.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.3
* The provided files include the code diff that addresses this vulnerability by adding nonce verification to the vulnerable function, as well as other ajax callbacks
