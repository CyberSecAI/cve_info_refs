The provided content relates to CVE-2023-1004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MarkText application on Windows does not properly filter `.js` files, which can be recognized and executed by Windows Script Host (WSH) as JScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file type filtering: The application fails to block `.js` files from being opened and interpreted by WSH.
- Lack of sandboxing: The application allows external files to be opened without proper security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A malicious actor can create a specially crafted markdown file containing a link or embedded code that downloads and executes arbitrary Javascript code through WSH.
- System compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the user running MarkText.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious markdown file: An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file containing javascript code or a link to an external `.js` file.
- User interaction: The user opens the malicious markdown file using MarkText.
- Download and execution:  When the markdown file is rendered by marktext, it triggers the download of the malicious `.js` file, which is then executed by the Windows Script Host (WSH).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and distribute malicious markdown files.
- Target user must open the malicious markdown file using the vulnerable MarkText application on Windows.
