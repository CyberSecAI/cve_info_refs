**CVE-2023-40338**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Folders Plugin displays an error message when attempting to access the Scan Organization Folder Log if no logs are available. This error message includes the absolute path of a log file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The absolute path of a log file is exposed in an error message.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain information about the Jenkins controller file system by viewing the exposed file path.
*   **Attack vectors**: By attempting to access the Scan Organization Folder Log when no logs are available, an attacker can view the error message and thus learn the absolute path of the log file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to access the "Scan Organization Folder Log" functionality. The specific permissions are not specified, but the CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs to be a "Low privileged" user.
