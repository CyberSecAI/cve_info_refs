{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The icecms allows unauthenticated access to the `getSetting` API endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure permissions allowing unauthorized access to the `getSetting` API endpoint, which exposes sensitive information including cloud storage credentials.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain cloud storage credentials (cosSecretId and cosSecretKey) and use them to gain control of the victim's Tencent Cloud platform console, potentially leading to complete compromise of their cloud services, including powering off servers.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing the publicly available `getSetting` API endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `getSetting` API endpoint."
