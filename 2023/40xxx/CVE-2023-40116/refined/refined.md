Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the system ignoring small source rectangle hints. This can be abused to create a non-visible PIP window that bypasses background restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of source rectangle hints, allowing for the creation of non-visible PIP windows.
- Failure to enforce background restrictions on PIP windows created through the identified weakness

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious application can create a non-visible Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window that bypasses background restrictions. This could allow the malicious app to operate in the background without user awareness and potentially perform malicious actions, such as data exfiltration.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious application can exploit the improper handling of source rectangle hints to create a non-visible PIP window, bypassing the background restriction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the target device.
- The attacker needs to have the capabilities to create PIP windows.
