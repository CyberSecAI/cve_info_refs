  "CVE-2023-40550": {
    "Description": "The shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.  Out-of-bounds read in `verify_buffer_sbat()` function in shim.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability during SBAT validation.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure during the system's boot phase. It may expose sensitive data due to an out-of-bounds read when validating SBAT information.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "The attacker would require the ability to control the Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) data."
      ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to inject or manipulate SBAT data. This may require high privileges, physical access to the system, or compromising the boot server during the early boot phase."
