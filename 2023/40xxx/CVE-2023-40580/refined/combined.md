# Mnemonic phrase may be accessed by Javascript through a private API

High

[C0x41lch0x41](/C0x41lch0x41)
published
GHSA-vqr6-hwg2-775w
Aug 23, 2023

## Package

Freighter
(Chrome extension)

## Affected versions

< 5.3.1

## Patched versions

5.3.1

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts access control to the mnemonic recovery phrase. It may be possible in some cases for a malicious website to access the recovery mnemonic phrase when the Freighter wallet is unlocked.

There is no evidence this security issue was exploited in the wild.

### Patches

Freighter wallet [5.3.1](https://github.com/stellar/freighter/pull/948) no longer allows Javascript to access the mnemonic phrase through the private API. The extension automatically updates when a new version is published. Every Freighter wallet should be up-to-date with the security patch.

Reminder that users should never install the application outside of the official extension stores.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
