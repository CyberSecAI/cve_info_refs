- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute privileged actions, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious activities. The specific impact will vary depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user who is able to access the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (or a user with similar low-level privileges) and needs to be able to access the vulnerable function without the proper authorization checks.
