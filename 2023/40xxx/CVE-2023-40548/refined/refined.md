  "CVE-2023-40548": {
    "description": "The shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* shim: Interger overflow leads to heap buffer overflow in verify\\_sbat\\_section on 32-bits systems (CVE-2023-40548)",
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow issue exists in shim when compiled for 32-bit processors. The issue is due to performing addition on a user-controlled value parsed from the PE being loaded without verifying that the result of the addition does not overflow. The overflowed value is passed as a size to AllocatePool, and then the resulting buffer is copied to using the original value, resulting in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "This flaw causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PE binary loaded by shim during early boot. An attacker needs to control the contents of the PE binary to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to modify the PE binary that is loaded by shim during boot. This can happen via physical access, or by compromising the boot server in a network boot scenario. The attacker needs to provide a malicious PE binary to trigger the vulnerability."
