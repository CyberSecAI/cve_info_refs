        "root_cause": ".NET deserialization vulnerability in the Ad Hoc Transfer module.",
        "weaknesses": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the insecure `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` method in the `UploadManager.DeserializeProcessor` function, which processes user-controlled input from the HTTP request without proper authentication.",
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the WS_FTP server.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted HTTPS POST request to any URI within the Ad Hoc Transfer module, which relies on a vulnerable IIS HTTP module called `MyFileUpload.UploadModule` to handle file uploads.  The attacker provides a serialized .NET object in a multipart form field.",

        "root_cause": "Unauthenticated .NET deserialization vulnerability within the `MyFileUpload.UploadModule` HTTP module of the Ad Hoc Transfer component.",
        "weaknesses": "The application uses `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` on attacker-controlled data without authentication, allowing arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted payload.",
        "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the WS_FTP server. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system.",
         "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted multipart POST request to the `/AHT/AhtApiService.asmx/AuthUser` endpoint or any endpoint within the Ad Hoc Transfer application. The request must include a multipart form field with a name that starts with either `::AHT_DEFAULT_UPLOAD_PARAMETER::` or `::AHT_UPLOAD_PARAMETER::` followed by a base64 encoded payload.",

        "weaknesses": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered, including one with a maximum CVSS score of 10. These vulnerabilities are related to how WS_FTP processes data.",
        "impact": "Mass exploitation attempts began shortly after the release of a proof-of-concept code for CVE-2023-40044, potentially leading to system compromise and data breaches.",
        "attack_vectors": "Exploitation attempts involved a consistent process, using a single Burpsuite domain, and executing NTUSER.dll, which is associated with a red-team post-exploitation kit. The specific vulnerabilities exploited were not specified, but it is clear the vulnerability chain leads to execution of OS-level commands. The Ad Hoc Transfer module is specifically targeted.",
