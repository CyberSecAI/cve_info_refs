**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a "broken access control" issue within the Simple URLs WordPress plugin. This means that a function or feature within the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the absence of proper access control mechanisms. This allows unauthorized users (specifically, a subscriber) to potentially execute actions that they should not have permission to perform.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact of the vulnerability can vary, but in general, a broken access control issue could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to functionality or data, potentially leading to modification or deletion of data, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.
- The impact is considered to have a "low severity".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has a "subscriber" level access to the WordPress website. The specific method or function that the attacker uses is not specified, but it would be an action that is typically reserved for higher-privileged users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with "subscriber" privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function within the plugin.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 5.4, indicating medium severity.
- The vulnerable versions are <= 117 of the Simple URLs plugin.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 118.
- A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
