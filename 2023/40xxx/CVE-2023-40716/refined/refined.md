- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the command line interpreter of FortiTester does not properly sanitize user-provided input when executing the `restore` or `backup` commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) is present.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized operating system commands with the privileges of the FortiTester application. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the command line interface (CLI) using specifically crafted arguments when running `execute restore` or `execute backup` commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have valid administrative authentication to the FortiTester CLI.
