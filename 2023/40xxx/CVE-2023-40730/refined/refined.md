- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The QMS.Mobile module lacks sufficient authorization checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could access confidential information, perform administrative functions, or cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low level privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability, no user interaction is required (UI:N).
