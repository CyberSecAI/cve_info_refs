Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40090:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-40090. The commit messages from android.googlesource.com mentions "Bug: 274478807" which is the bug ID associated with CVE-2023-40090 in the Android Security Bulletin. The description in the commit also matches the vulnerability described in the bulletin.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in `BTM_BleVerifySignature` function. It was using a stock `memcmp` for signature verification. This implementation is vulnerable to timing attacks that could potentially reveal the signature content.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a standard `memcmp` in a security-sensitive context. `memcmp` is known to potentially leak information through timing variations due to early exit if compared bytes don't match. This creates a side-channel that can be exploited.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this timing attack could allow an attacker to deduce the signature, which could potentially be used to bypass security measures that rely on signature verification.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a side-channel timing attack on the `BTM_BleVerifySignature` function during signature verification.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Bluetooth component in a way that allows them to time the execution of the signature verification function. This likely implies being within Bluetooth range and initiating a connection or interaction that involves signature verification.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved by replacing the stock `memcmp` with `CRYPTO_memcmp` which is hardened against timing attacks.
*   The patch was applied to the Bluetooth module in AOSP.

**4. Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text explicitly mentions this commit is for security purposes: "Tag: #security"
*   The fix has been cherry-picked from the internal Google Android review system.
*   The fix is included in the Android Security Bulletin for December 2023 as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2023-40090 is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the Bluetooth module of Android that could allow an attacker to potentially deduce the signature used in BLE, through observing the time taken to verify a signature.
