{
  "CVE-2023-40547": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The shim's http boot support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability leads to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise, and Secure Boot bypass.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable during the early boot phase by crafting a malicious HTTP request. An attacker would need to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise the boot server to exploit this successfully.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to either be in a position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise the boot server."
