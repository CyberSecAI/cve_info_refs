# RHSA-2024:1959 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: shim security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2024%3A1959)

## Topic

An update for shim is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining
to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.

Security Fix(es):

* shim: RCE in http boot support may lead to Secure Boot bypass (CVE-2023-40547)
* shim: Interger overflow leads to heap buffer overflow in verify\_sbat\_section on 32-bits systems (CVE-2023-40548)
* shim: Out-of-bounds read printing error messages (CVE-2023-40546)
* shim: Out-of-bounds read in verify\_buffer\_authenticode() malformed PE file (CVE-2023-40549)
* shim: Out-of-bound read in verify\_buffer\_sbat() (CVE-2023-40550)
* shim: out of bounds read when parsing MZ binaries (CVE-2023-40551)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

IMPORTANT: The new shim revokes ALL VERSIONS of GRUB2 before grub2-2.02-0.87.el7\_9.14. Therefore GRUB2 MUST be updated to the latest
version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7\_9.14 BEFORE or SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to continue to work. Failure to update GRUB2 will result in an UNBOOTABLE system.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

```
In [CVE-2023-40546](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9fh5-955w-9jfh "CVE-2023-40546"), an incorrect invocation of LogError()
causes a read from the page at address 0, which on newer systems will
correctly cause a fault.  The immediate fix for this CVE is to fix the
invocation so that the error is logged correctly, but there is more that
can be done.

This patch adds additional checks to ensure that the format specifier on
any of these invocations can not be NULL, thereby mitigating this entire
class of error from creating a fault.  Additionally, most of these
checks are done using _Static_assert(), so they should normally be
triggered at compile time.

Therefore GRUB2 MUST be updated to the latest version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.14 (RHSA-2024:128440-02) BEFORE OR SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to continue to work. Failure to update GRUB2 will result in an UNBOOTABLE system.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 13:33:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:1834 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1834)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 13:41:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1835 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1835)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c17)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-17 10:10:10 UTC  ``` all shim builds were tested against CVE reproducer as well as sanity tests: signatures on efi binaries, VM booting with SB disabled/enabled, http/netboot shim-15.8-3 (fc) shim-15.8-1.el7 shim-15.8-2.el8 shim-15.8-2.el8_1 shim-15.8-2.el8_2 shim-15.8-2.el8_4 shim-15.8-2.el8_6 shim-15.8-4.el8_9 shim-15.8-2.el8_10 shim-15.8-2.el9 shim-15.8-3.el9 shim-15.8-3.el9_2 shim-15.8-4.el9_3 shim-15.8-3.el9_4   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:37:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:1873 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1873)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:42:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1876 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1876)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:51:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1883 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1883)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 07:54:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:1903 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1903)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 07:57:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:1902 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1902)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-23 00:47:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2024:1959 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1959)   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-29 02:16:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:2086 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2086)   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 1046268 1069054

This release fixes various issues in shim bootloader and updates it to
a supported version. Older versions of the shim may eventually be blocked
by Secure Boot, so it is strongly advised for Secure Boot enabled systems
to upgrade to this newer version to keep the system bootable.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
15.8-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your shim packages.

For the detailed security status of shim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/shim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: shim 15.8 released with 6 CVE fixes

<https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.8> says it fixes these CVEs:

   CVE-2023-40546 mok: fix LogError() invocation
   CVE-2023-40547 - avoid incorrectly trusting HTTP headers
   CVE-2023-40548 Fix integer overflow on SBAT section size on 32-bit system
   CVE-2023-40549 Authenticode: verify that the signature header is in bounds.
   CVE-2023-40550 pe: Fix an out-of-bound read in verify_buffer_sbat()
   CVE-2023-40551: pe-relocate: Fix bounds check for MZ binaries

According to Red Hat's bugzilla, the details on these are:

CVE-2023-40546: Out-of-bounds read printing error messages

A NULL pointer dereference error exists in mirror_one_esl() at mok.c. If shim
fails to create a new ESL variable it tries to log an error message, however
one of the variables used in the LogError() function doesn't match the format
string and additionally it may be NULL. A successful attack may lead shim to
crash resulting in a Denial-of-Service.

<https://github.com/rhboot/shim/commit/dae82f6bd72cf600e5d48046ec674a441d0f49d7>

CVE-2023-40547: RCE in http boot support may lead to Secure Boot bypass

The MSRC Vulnerability & Mitigations (V&M) team discovered a critical Remote
Code Execution vulnerability in the latest version of the Linux shim
(<https://github.com/rhboot/shim>). The shim's http boot support (httpboot.c)
trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response, leading to
a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive.

Upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234589>
Upstream fix: <https://github.com/rhboot/shim/commit/0226b56513b2b8bd5fd281bce77c40c9bf07c66d>

CVE-2023-40548: Integer overflow leads to heap buffer overflow in
  verify_sbat_section on 32-bits systems

An integer overflow issue exists in shim when compiled for 32-bit processors.
The issue is due to performing addition on a user-controlled value parsed from
the PE being loaded without verifying that the result of the addition does not
overflow. The overflowed value is passed as a size to AllocatePool, and then
the resulting buffer is copied to using the original value, resulting in a
buffer overflow.

Upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241782>
Upstream fix: <https://github.com/rhboot/shim/commit/96dccc255b16e9465dbee50b3cef6b3db74d11c8>

CVE-2023-40549: Out-of-bounds read in verify_buffer_authenticode() malformed
  PE file

An out-of-bounds read issue exists in the verify_buffer_authenticode() function
in shim.c. This issue is due to adding an offset to a pointer and then accessing
the result without proper bounds checking. This bug is reachable by providing a
malformed PE file to shim. This code runs before signature validation of the PE
file.

Upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241797>
Upstream fix: <https://github.com/rhboot/shim/commit/afdc5039de0a4a3a40162a32daa070f94a883f09>

CVE-2023-40550
Score: 5.5
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Desc: Out-of-bound read in verify_buffer_sbat()

There's an out of bound read in shim at verify_buffer_sbat() function, which can
lead to information disclosure.

Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Desc: out of bounds read when parsing MZ binaries

When handling MZ binaries, crafted PE headers can lead to a out-of-bounds read,
causing shim to crash and possibly exposing sensitive information.

# shim, a first-stage UEFI bootloader

shim is a trivial EFI application that, when run, attempts to open and
execute another application. It will initially attempt to do this via the
standard EFI `LoadImage()` and `StartImage()` calls. If these fail (because Secure
Boot is enabled and the binary is not signed with an appropriate key, for
instance) it will then validate the binary against a built-in certificate. If
this succeeds and if the binary or signing key are not forbidden then shim
will relocate and execute the binary.

shim will also install a protocol which permits the second-stage bootloader
to perform similar binary validation. This protocol has a GUID as described
in the shim.h header file and provides a single entry point. On 64-bit systems
this entry point expects to be called with SysV ABI rather than MSABI, so calls
to it should not be wrapped.

On systems with a TPM chip enabled and supported by the system firmware,
shim will extend various PCRs with the digests of the targets it is
loading. A full list is in the file [README.tpm](/rhboot/shim/blob/main/README.tpm) .

To use shim, simply place a DER-encoded public certificate in a file such as
pub.cer and build with `make VENDOR_CERT_FILE=pub.cer`.

There are a couple of build options, and a couple of ways to customize the
build, described in [BUILDING](/rhboot/shim/blob/main/BUILDING).

See the [test plan](/rhboot/shim/blob/main/testplan.txt), and file a ticket if anything fails!

In the event that the developers need to be contacted related to a security
incident or vulnerability, please mail secalert@redhat.com.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

On some ARM platform, jlinton noticed that when we fail to set a
variable (because it isn't supported at all, presumably), our error
message has an extra argument that doesn't match the format string.

This patch removes the extra argument.
