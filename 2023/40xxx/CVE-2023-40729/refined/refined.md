- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected application lacks security controls to enforce encrypted communication using HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) position can intercept, manipulate, or steal confidential information transmitted by the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to perform a MitM attack. User interaction is required for the attack to be successful.
