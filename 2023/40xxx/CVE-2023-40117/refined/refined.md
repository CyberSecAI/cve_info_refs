Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40117:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2023-40117 within the Android Security Bulletin for October 2023. Specifically, it appears within the "System" section of the bulletin as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `LockPatternUtils#setLockCredential()` handles failures. When the function fails, it can either return a false value or throw an exception. The issue is that the exception is not properly caught, leading to a crash of the com.android.settings application.

Additionally, there is a related issue:
- When RescueParty detects that a system process is crashing frequently, it attempts to recover by resetting settings, including `secure_frp_mode`. This setting is used to track if the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) challenge has been passed, and resetting this value allows for a bypass of FRP restrictions by setting a new lock screen credential.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncaught Exception:** The `LockPatternUtils#setLockCredential()` function doesn't properly handle exceptions, causing application crashes.
- **Settings Reset Vulnerability:** RescueParty's setting reset process unintentionally includes the `secure_frp_mode` setting, which can be exploited to bypass Factory Reset Protection.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Application Crash:** An uncaught exception in `LockPatternUtils#setLockCredential()` causes the `com.android.settings` application to crash.
- **FRP Bypass:** Resetting the `secure_frp_mode` setting can allow an attacker to bypass Factory Reset Protection (FRP) and gain unauthorized access to the device.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability related to `LockPatternUtils#setLockCredential()` can be triggered by attempting to set a lock screen credential when the system is in a state where it might fail.
- The FRP bypass vulnerability can be triggered by causing the system to crash frequently so that RescueParty attempts to reset the device settings.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** For the FRP bypass, an attacker would need physical access to the device. The attacker would need to trigger the RescueParty process and attempt to reset the secure settings.
- **ADB Access** The initial commit shows the vulnerability can be triggered with ADB access.

**Summary of Patches:**

The patches to fix these vulnerabilities include:
- Catching the exception in `LockPatternUtils#setLockCredential()` and treating it as a false return.
- Preventing `secure_frp_mode` from being reset when RescueParty intervenes by excluding it from the list of settings that are reset.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was tested by attempting to set lock screen credentials while in secure FRP mode via a smartlock setup activity launched using an ADB intent.
- The commit messages also show that changes were made to the code to prevent the crash and FRP bypass and also to ensure compatibility with Java 15.
- There are code changes in `ChooseLockPassword.java`, `ChooseLockPattern.java` which were merged into `SaveAndFinishWorker.java`
-The commit messages reference bug 253043065 which is also referenced in the Android Security Bulletin
