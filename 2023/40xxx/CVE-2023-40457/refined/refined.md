Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40457:

**Confirmation:** The content from blog.benjojo.co.uk directly discusses a vulnerability affecting Extreme Networks EXOS, which is the vendor associated with CVE-2023-40457. The blog post provides more detail than the basic CVE description.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the improper handling of malformed BGP attributes, specifically:
*   **Attribute 21 (AS\_PATHLIMIT):**  A corrupted or malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attribute can cause the BGP session to reset.
*  **Attribute 25 (IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community):**  Similarly, a malformed version of this attribute can trigger a session reset.

The underlying issue is that Extreme EXOS does not fully implement RFC 7606, which defines how BGP implementations should handle unknown or malformed attributes. Instead of treating the routes with the malformed attributes as unreachable and continuing the session, EXOS terminates the session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of RFC 7606 Implementation:** Extreme EXOS does not implement the recommended handling of malformed BGP attributes as described in RFC 7606, making it susceptible to attacks using malformed attributes.
*   **Session Termination on Malformed Attribute:** The software responds to malformed or unknown attributes by terminating the BGP session instead of isolating the routes related to the malformed attributes and continuing the session. This can be triggered by specific attributes, specifically, attribute 21 and 25.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to force a BGP session reset on a target router. If a critical peering session is reset, this can lead to significant disruptions to network connectivity.
*   **Prolonged Outages:** The "wormable" nature of the issue can cause a continuous cycle of session resets. After the BGP session restarts, the router will receive the same malformed BGP update causing it to reset the session again, leading to a potentially prolonged outage.
*  **Network Partitioning:** By targeting BGP sessions between carriers, this could be used to partition large sections of the internet by stopping traffic flow between them.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **BGP UPDATE Messages:** The attack vector involves crafting a BGP UPDATE message containing a malformed version of a specific attribute (21 or 25). The attacker injects this crafted BGP update through a BGP peer.
*   **Transitive Attribute Propagation:** The malformed attribute, if unknown by intermediate routers with the transitive bit set, can be propagated through other networks until it reaches a vulnerable Extreme EXOS device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **BGP Peer Connection:** The attacker needs to be a BGP peer of the targeted network or of a network that peers with the target network.
*   **Ability to Send BGP UPDATEs:** The attacker must have the capability to send BGP UPDATE messages with crafted attributes.

**Vendor Response:**
*   Extreme Networks initially did not classify this as a vulnerability because they state they are not required to implement RFC7606. They also said they are "evaluating" support for RFC 7606 in the future but have no plan for a patch at the time of writing of the blog post.

**Mitigation:**
*  There is no known patch or mitigation for this issue besides disabling the affected attributes.

In summary, the content details a serious vulnerability in Extreme Networks EXOS due to its lack of full RFC 7606 support for handling malformed BGP attributes, making it susceptible to denial-of-service attacks. The content also highlights the importance of proper BGP implementation in maintaining the stability of internet routing.
