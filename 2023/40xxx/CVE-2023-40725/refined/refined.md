- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application returns inconsistent error messages in response to invalid user credentials during login.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the application's error handling during login attempts, specifically that it reveals different error messages depending on whether a username is valid.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can enumerate usernames, identifying valid users by observing the differences in error messages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring physical or local access to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the application and the ability to attempt login with various user credentials.
