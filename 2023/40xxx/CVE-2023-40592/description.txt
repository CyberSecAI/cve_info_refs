In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.1.1, 9.0.6, and 8.2.12, an attacker can craft a special web request that can result in reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on the “/app/search/table” web endpoint. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the Splunk platform instance.
