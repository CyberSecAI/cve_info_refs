- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could perform actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability lies within the plugin's code, specifically in functions that lack proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an unprivileged user.
