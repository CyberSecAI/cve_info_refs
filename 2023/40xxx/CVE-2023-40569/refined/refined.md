  "CVE-2023-40569": {
    "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Write in the `progressive_decompress` function. This issue is likely down to incorrect calculations of the `nXSrc` and `nYSrc` variables. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect calculations of the `nXSrc` and `nYSrc` variables in the `progressive_decompress` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash, and potentially code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RDP server can send crafted data to trigger the vulnerability in the client during the progressive decompression of image data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or manipulate the RDP server that the vulnerable FreeRDP client connects to."
