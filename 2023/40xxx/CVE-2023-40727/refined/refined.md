- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The QMS.Mobile module uses a weak and outdated application signing mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper verification of cryptographic signatures (CWE-347).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could tamper with the application code. This could potentially lead to malicious code injection, information disclosure, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and low privileges.
