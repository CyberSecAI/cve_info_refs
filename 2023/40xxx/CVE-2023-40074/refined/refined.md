CVE-2023-40074:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from a lack of validation of data when writing to or reading from XML. Specifically, PersistableBundle does lazy unparcelling, which removes the benefit of validating values during unparcelling.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The system does not validate data during XML read/write operations, specifically when dealing with PersistableBundle, leading to a potential for invalid data to be introduced.
  - Impact of exploitation: This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
  - Attack vectors: An attacker could provide malicious or malformed data when writing to or reading from XML, which would trigger the vulnerability during a subsequent operation when the data is read.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the data written to or read from the XML files.
