{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `a2dp_vendor_opus_decoder_decode_packet` function calls `opus_decode()` to decode frames. If the initial decoding fails, it retries with different parameters. However, after the retry, no further checks are performed on the return value. A negative return value from the retry, when converted to an unsigned value to scale the frame buffer, can lead to an enormous size, causing a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds write can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious audio packet that triggers the decoding retry and results in a negative return value, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to send a crafted Bluetooth audio packet to the vulnerable device."
