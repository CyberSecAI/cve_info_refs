{
  "CVE-2023-40610": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper authorization check.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The default examples database connection allows access to both the examples schema and Apache Superset's metadata database. An attacker can use a specially crafted CTE SQL statement to change data in the metadata database, potentially tampering with authentication/authorization data.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation by modifying metadata, potentially leading to tampering with authentication/authorization data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Using the SQL Lab interface with the default examples database connection, an attacker can execute crafted SQL statements.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires access to the SQL Lab interface and the ability to use the default examples database connection."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate input validation.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application fails to properly validate SQL queries, specifically Common Table Expressions (CTEs) combined with RETURNING clause, allowing unauthorized write operations on metadata tables even when SELECT permission is intended",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries that bypass the intended access controls leading to data manipulation, privilege escalation, and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) by altering data within the 'key_value' table.",
      "Attack vectors": "SQL injection via the SQL Lab feature, utilizing a default database connection that has write access to Superset's internal tables by crafting specific CTE queries.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires access to Superset SQL Lab with the ability to use the default example database connection."
