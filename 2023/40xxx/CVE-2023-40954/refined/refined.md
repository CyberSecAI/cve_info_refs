Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the content:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `recency` parameter in the `get_all_progress` method of the `web_progress` model in the Odoo module. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `recency` parameter, which is intended to specify a time interval, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization. This enables an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Public API Exposure:** The vulnerable `get_all_progress` method is exposed through the Odoo External API, making it accessible to remote attackers, including portal users with limited privileges.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The database cursor is directly used to execute the crafted SQL query without performing access right checks, which amplifies the impact of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to modify database records, including user passwords, leading to privilege escalation (e.g., gaining admin access).
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete any information accessible through SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **External API:** The primary attack vector is through the Odoo External API. Attackers can send XML-RPC requests to the `web.progress` model's `get_all_progress` method.
- **Crafted `recency` Parameter:** The attack payload is embedded within the `recency` parameter of the method call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Odoo instance.
- **Odoo User Account:** The attacker needs an Odoo user account, even a low-privileged portal user account, is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability through the External API.
- **Understanding of Odoo API:** Knowledge of Odoo's External API and how to make method calls is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries to be injected.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 11.0 through 11.0.2, v.12.0 through 12.0.2, v.13.0 through 13.0.2, v.14.0 through 14.0.2.1, v.15.0 through 15.0.2, v.16.0 through 16.0.2.1 of the `web_progress` module.
- Patched versions were made available in the Odoo Apps Store starting from August 5th, 2023.
- The provided GitHub content includes proof-of-concept exploit code (`exploit-web_progress.py`), a demonstration video (`PoC-web_progress.mp4`), and a detailed description of the vulnerability (`README.md`).

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description and includes a specific example of how the SQL injection can be performed to escalate privileges.
