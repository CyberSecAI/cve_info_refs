- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows users to upload arbitrary file types without proper validation or restriction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload of dangerous types (CWE-434)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could upload malicious files, potentially leading to code tampering (modification of program or data).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, attacker uploads a malicious file through the application's upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have user-level access to the application and be able to use the file upload feature. The user also needs to interact with the uploaded file for code tampering to occur (user interaction).
