Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40027:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `adminMeta` GraphQL query in `@keystone-6/core` was publicly accessible when `ui.isAccessAllowed` was undefined. This behavior differed from the default AdminUI middleware, which requires a valid session by default if a `session` strategy is defined.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent access control behavior between the `adminMeta` GraphQL query and the AdminUI middleware.
- The system did not correctly enforce access restrictions on the `adminMeta` query when `ui.isAccessAllowed` was not explicitly defined.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the `adminMeta` GraphQL query, potentially exposing sensitive metadata about the application's data structure and configuration.
- This vulnerability could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the GraphQL endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the GraphQL endpoint.
- No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `@keystone-6/core` versions prior to 5.5.1.
- The fix ensures that when `ui.isAccessAllowed` is undefined, access to the `adminMeta` query is denied by default, aligning with the behavior of the AdminUI middleware.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.3.
- The vulnerability is located in the `@keystone-6/core` package.
- The vulnerability affects developers who assumed their session strategy would by default protect the `adminMeta` query.
- A workaround before patching was to define an `isAccessAllowed` function.
