Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "broken access control issue," which means there's a missing check for authorization, authentication, or nonce tokens in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls, leading to a bypass of intended privilege restrictions.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  The impact is described as low severity. The specific impact will vary depending on the affected functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable function where access controls are missing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A user with the "Subscriber" privilege is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

The content also mentions that a virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate this issue. The affected software is the "ReviewX" WordPress plugin, version 1.6.17 and earlier, and the fix is included in version 1.6.18.
