Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-40236:

**Root Cause:**
The Pexip VMR self-service portal versions prior to v3 use the same SSH host keys across different customer installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use of the same SSH host keys across different installations.
- Lack of unique SSH host keys for each instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers can spoof fake VMR portal instances.
- Potential for unauthorized access, data interception, or manipulation, since an attacker could potentially intercept traffic between the user and the real portal instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) positioning within the network path between a user and a VMR portal instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the communication path between the user and the VMR self-service portal.
- Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to carry out a man in the middle attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all VMR self-service portal versions prior to v3.
- Mitigation involves manually removing and regenerating the SSH host keys on each VMR Portal instance.
- The resolution is to upgrade to VMR portal v3.
- The vulnerability is rated as high risk with a CVSS 3.1 base score of 7.5.
