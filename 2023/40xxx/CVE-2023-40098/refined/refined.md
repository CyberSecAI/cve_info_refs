Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue related to how priority conversations are handled for secondary users in the Android framework. Specifically, the priority conversation widget is not being properly disabled for secondary users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. It appears that secondary users are improperly allowed to access information related to priority conversations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure. An attacker with access to a secondary user profile could potentially gain access to information about priority conversations that should be restricted to the primary user.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker needs to have access to a secondary user profile on the Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be a user who has access to a secondary user profile on the affected Android device. This suggests a local attack vector, where the attacker is a user already logged into the device as a secondary user.

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates that a fix involves disabling the priority conversation widget for secondary users. The commit also mentions a test case `NotificationConversationInfoTest.java` that verifies the fix, and that conversations should have priority on the primary user, but not on secondary users. The fix was cherry-picked from a previous commit.
