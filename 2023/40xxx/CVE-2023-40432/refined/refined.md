Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-40432:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in the Apple Neural Engine.
*   Specifically, it involves memory handling within the Apple Neural Engine component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The core vulnerability is related to improper memory management within the Apple Neural Engine.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit allows an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This means an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious application.
*   The application would need to leverage the memory handling vulnerability in the Apple Neural Engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to install and run a malicious app on a device with a vulnerable Apple Neural Engine.
*   No further information about additional attacker capabilities is provided.

**Affected Devices:**
*   **watchOS:** Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2
*   **tvOS:** Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K (all models)
*   **iOS/iPadOS:** iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later
