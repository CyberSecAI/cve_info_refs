- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users could perform actions they are not authorized to perform, potentially leading to unintended modifications or data access. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the broken access control by sending requests to the vulnerable function without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A subscriber-level user is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
