Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** Integer underflow in the `lxt2_rd_iter_radix` function when handling LXT2 files in GTKWave. Specifically, when processing a left or right shift operation, the code calculates a size using `lt->len[idx] - 1`. If `lt->len[idx]` is zero, this calculation results in an integer underflow, leading to `memmove` being called with a negative size parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Underflow:** The core issue is the integer underflow in the size calculation for the `memmove` operation.
*   **Uncontrolled Memory Copy:**  The negative size parameter passed to `memmove` results in a large copy operation that will corrupt memory.
*  **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate `lt->len[idx]` before using it in the size calculation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary impact is uncontrolled memory corruption due to the erroneous `memmove` operation.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The memory corruption may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code due to the multi-threaded nature of GTKWave.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious LXT2 File:**  The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.lxt2` file.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of the LXT2 file format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Craft Malicious File:** The attacker needs to create a malicious LXT2 file with specific values to trigger the integer underflow, namely setting `msb` to `0x80000000` and `lsb` to `0x7fffffff` or vice versa which leads to `lt->len[idx]` being equal to `0`.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the malicious LXT2 file using GTKWave. This can be achieved through email, file sharing or other means.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `lxt2_rd_iter_radix` function of the `lxt2_read.c` file.
*   The `memmove` operation is called within a switch statement based on values extracted from the LXT2 file content.
*   The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation that leads to the integer underflow.
*   The issue can occur in both left and right shift operations (`LXT2_RD_ENC_LSH0/1` and `LXT2_RD_ENC_RSH0/1`).
*   The report includes a crash log showing a `negative-size-param` error reported by AddressSanitizer.
*   The vulnerability affects GTKWave version 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.

**CVE-2023-39414 specifically relates to the right shift operation case.** (CVE-2023-39413 is related to the left shift operation)
