{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when processing the `context->Planes` data in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data` function. The function processes the data without verifying that it contains a sufficient length, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a crash by sending insufficient data for `context->Planes`.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious RDP server sending a crafted NSC (Network Simple Codec) compressed data stream to the FreeRDP client. The crafted data will lack sufficient length, triggering the out-of-bounds read in `nsc_rle_decompress_data`.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the RDP server and have the ability to send crafted RDP messages with insufficient data for `context->Planes`. This can happen if the attacker compromises a legitimate server or acts as a malicious server.",
        "additional_details": "The `nsc_stream_initialize` function assigns the `context->Planes` pointer and `context->PlanesSize`. The `nsc_rle_decompress_data` function uses those values but doesn't check for sufficient data length before processing, resulting in the vulnerability."
