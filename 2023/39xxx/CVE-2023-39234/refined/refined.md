```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds write due to improper validation of array index when processing VZT files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `autosort` array, which is allocated based on the number of time ticks, can be written out-of-bounds during the sorting process. The index used for writing is calculated based on the contents of the VZT file and is not checked against the bounds of the allocated memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by corrupting heap memory through out-of-bounds writes.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted VZT file, which is opened by a victim, triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious VZT file and convince a victim to open it with a vulnerable version of GTKWave."
