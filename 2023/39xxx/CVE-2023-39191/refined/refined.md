{
  "CVE-2023-39191": {
    "Description": "The eBPF subsystem in the Linux kernel has an improper input validation flaw. The issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of dynamic pointers within user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. This may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is insufficient stack type checks in the eBPF verifier when dealing with dynamic pointers (dynptr). Specifically, the verifier does not adequately validate user-supplied eBPF programs before execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient stack type checks",
       "Lack of proper validation of user-supplied eBPF programs before execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can leverage the vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the kernel context.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by loading a specially crafted eBPF program.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute high-privileged code with `CAP_BPF` capabilities on the target system to exploit this flaw."
