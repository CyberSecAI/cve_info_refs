{
  "CVE-2023-39513": {
    "root_cause": "The `debug_log_return()` function in `host.php` renders user-supplied data from a data query template path without proper HTML escaping, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker with 'Template Editor>Data Query' privileges can inject malicious JavaScript into the cacti database. When a victim user with 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' privileges views the data query debug information, the malicious JavaScript executes in the victim's browser. This can lead to account takeover, arbitrary actions, redirects to malicious sites, data theft, browser exploits, and participation in botnets.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker configures a data query template with malicious code in the template path. The victim then triggers the vulnerability by accessing a URL with the format `http:/<HOST>/cacti/host.php?action=query_verbose&id=<QUERY ID>&host_id=<HOST ID>&nostate=true` or by requesting verbose data query logs.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated and have the 'Template Editor>Data Query' privileges to inject the malicious payload. The victim needs 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' privileges to trigger the vulnerability."
