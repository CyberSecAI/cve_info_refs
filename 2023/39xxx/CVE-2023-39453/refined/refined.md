{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free in the `tif_parse_sub_IFD` function within the Accusoft ImageGear library. This occurs when parsing a crafted TIFF file with a SUBIFD tag containing invalid offset values equal to the offset of the IFD header. This allows the same IFD record pointer to be stored multiple times into the allocated buffer, causing a double free when `free_IFD_record` is called.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free (CWE-416)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. The use-after-free vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially overwrite memory leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker must provide a specially crafted TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable Accusoft ImageGear library. The crafted file must contain a SUBIFD tag with invalid offset values.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious TIFF file that will be processed by an application using the vulnerable library. No special privileges or specific network positions are required."
