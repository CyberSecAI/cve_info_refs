- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Bosch IP cameras allows for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability, specifically due to improper input validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative rights can execute arbitrary commands on the operating system of the camera, potentially leading to full system compromise. This includes a high potential impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative rights on the camera. This could be achieved via stolen credentials, insecure passwords, or phishing attacks.
