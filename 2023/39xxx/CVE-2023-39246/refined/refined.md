- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure operation on Windows Junction during installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software creates Windows junctions insecurely during the installation process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to create an arbitrary folder inside a restricted directory, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker would need to be a local user with the ability to manipulate the file system during the installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and user interaction is required.
