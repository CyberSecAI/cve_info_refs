### **[psmoros](/psmoros)** commented [Jun 1, 2023](#issue-1735946206)

| Hello üëã  I run a security community that finds and fixes vulnerabilities in OSS. A researcher ([@chuayupeng](https://github.com/chuayupeng)) has found a potential issue, which I would be eager to share with you.  Could you add a `SECURITY.md` file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future.  Looking forward to hearing from you üëç  (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |

[m-Ryan](/m-Ryan/m-Ryan)/README.md

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Ryan, and I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. Let me give you a brief overview of what I'm currently working on.

### Projects

#### [Easy Email](https://www.easyemail.pro/?utm_source=profile)

I am actively maintaining the Easy-Email project. Easy-Email is a powerful email library that simplifies the process of editing email templates. If you're looking for an easy-to-use and reliable solution for your email needs, I highly recommend checking it out.

If you need consultation or customized services, check the prices [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/easyemail/commissions).

#### [Easy Email Pro](https://www.easyemail.pro/?utm_source=profile)

In addition to Easy Email, I am also in the process of developing a commercial version of the email editor with enhanced functionality. This enhanced version comes packed with even more powerful features to cater to advanced email requirements.

* Responsive Design: Supports displaying different user interfaces for desktop and mobile devices.
* Email Studio: Creating custom blocks and configuration panels through drag-and-drop editing, without the need for coding.
* Enhanced Editor: The editor has been improved to use an iframe and is compatible with various browsers.
* Easy Customization: Provides easier customization options to tailor the user interface according to specific needs.
  & We will provide consulting services and email support.

If you're interested in leveraging the full potential of email capabilities for your business, don't hesitate to get in touch with me at ch.mao@qq.com.

| Hello [@m-Ryan](https://github.com/m-Ryan), as per the previous issue raised, I have gone ahead to file for a CVE for the issue found here: [#321](https://github.com/zalify/easy-email-editor/issues/321)  Creating this current issue to highlight the XSS vulnerability in your source code, and to responsibly disclose it. Given that more than half a year has passed since initial contact, and the lack of response from your end, I have opted to publish the article. More details provided here: <https://medium.com/p/3fa08f3e0d49>  The CVE is tracked provisionally under CVE ID [CVE-2023-39683](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3256-58fp-785h "CVE-2023-39683"). Just a heads up! Remediation details are provided within the article as well, hoping for an acknowledgement on this. |

| causing code to run on a page within a json object from unsanitised user input has some effect on the integrity of the data on the site. Just by wrapping the eval function in JSON.parse would have fixed this. I provided the fix as well. Whether you believe this would cause any impact or not is secondary, would you be willing to implement a one liner to fix this? If you are agreeable I can submit a push request for this. |

| JSON.parse cannot directly replace eval; it can only parse JSON-like strings and cannot handle Object strings. For example, {a: "123"} is not allowed.  Additionally, this panel is actually a developer debugging panel. I don't believe it should be accessible to users. Even if users do access it, it will only load their own templates or templates provided by developers. In such cases, there won't be any impact. |

| I understand that case where object strings are not handled, and will think about it. However, implementing any functionality for any users, whether developer or not, should still not execute code if that is not it's intended function. I believe it is a valid vulnerability, even if it is low in severity due to the low impact it can cause. |

| As for the updated recommendation as per your example, here's a regex that converts Object strings into proper JSON format that can be accepted by parse, without actually using eval.  ``` string.replace(/([a-z][^:]*)(?=\s*:)/g, '"$1"');  ``` |

| In fact, it's challenging to replace eval with regular expressions and JSON stringify. The examples you provided have several issues, such as the inability to handle {a: "123", "b":"234"} and {"a": "123", "b":"22:34:00"}. |

| Hello üëã  I run a security community that finds and fixes vulnerabilities in OSS. A researcher ([@chuayupeng](https://github.com/chuayupeng)) has found a potential issue, which I would be eager to share with you.  Could you add a `SECURITY.md` file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future.  Looking forward to hearing from you üëç  (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |

CVE-2023-39683
Description: Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in EasyEmail to all current versions allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the user input parameter(s).
Affected Components:
- https://github.com/zalify/easy-email/blob/master/packages/easy-email-extensions/src/AttributePanel/components/adapter/Json.adapter.ts
- https://github.com/zalify/easy-email/blob/master/packages/easy-email-extensions/src/SourceCodePanel/index.tsx
```

Update: The vulnerability was found in version 4.12.2. As such, the CVE should reflect the last known version to be vulnerable. However, all versions up to date are still vulnerable to this, and there are no plans to fix this as per the developer‚Äôs intent.

# Description

Due to the usage of an eval function on the event.target.value, DOM XSS was possible while editing the JSON Source Code Panel. I could pop an alert using the following proof of concept, but any other javascript code execution would be possible as well. In the interest of keeping the report succinct, I have opted to report this as a DOM XSS though. The vulnerability is because of the following code in the codepath [here](https://github.com/zalify/easy-email/blob/master/packages/easy-email-extensions/src/SourceCodePanel/index.tsx).

```
const onChangeCode = useCallback(
    (event: React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
      try {
        const parseValue = JSON.parse(
          JSON.stringify(eval('(' + event.target.value + ')'))
        ) as IBlockData;
...
```

From this it can be seen that the eval was called on the value without any sanitisation. A simple fix would be to do something like this instead:

```
const parseValue = JSON.parse(`${ event.target.value}`)
```

which would get rid of the need to eval the value before anything else.

# Proof of Concept

Enter the following payload after selecting a template, and then mouse away and click elsewhere to trigger the onblur change.

```
{
  "type": "page",
  "payload": alert(1),
... (can be deleted without changing the overall execution of the payload above) ...
}
```
# Impact

Potentially executing js code on the browser.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
