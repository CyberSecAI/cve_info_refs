# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1818

## GTKWave LXT2 facgeometry parsing integer overflow vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-39273,CVE-2023-39271,CVE-2023-39274,CVE-2023-39275,CVE-2023-39272,CVE-2023-39270

##### SUMMARY

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the LXT2 facgeometry parsing functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .lxt2 file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. So, for example, itâ€™s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to cause the gtkwave program to be executed and load a potentially malicious file.

LXT2 (InterLaced eXtensible Trace Version 2) files are parsed by the functions found in `lxt2_read.c`. These functions are used in the `lxt2vcd` file conversion utility, `rtlbrowse`, `lxt2miner`, and by the GUI portion of GTKwave, which are thus all affected by the issue described in this report.

To parse LXT2 files, the function `lxt2_rd_init` is called:

```
     struct lxt2_rd_trace *lxt2_rd_init(const char *name) {
[1]      struct lxt2_rd_trace *lt = (struct lxt2_rd_trace *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct lxt2_rd_trace));
         lxtint32_t i;

[2]      if (!(lt->handle = fopen(name, "rb"))) {
             lxt2_rd_close(lt);
             lt = NULL;
         } else {
             lxtint16_t id = 0, version = 0;
             ...
[3]          if (!fread(&id, 2, 1, lt->handle)) {
                 id = 0;
             }
             if (!fread(&version, 2, 1, lt->handle)) {
                 id = 0;
             }
             if (!fread(&lt->granule_size, 1, 1, lt->handle)) {
                 id = 0;
             }

```

At [1] the `lt` structure is initialized. This is the structure that will contain all the information about the input file.

The input file is opened [2] and 3 fields are read [3] to make sure the input file is a supported LXT2 file.

```
         ...
[4]      rcf = fread(&lt->numfacbytes, 4, 1, lt->handle);
         lt->numfacbytes = rcf ? lxt2_rd_get_32(&lt->numfacbytes, 0) : 0;
         rcf = fread(&lt->longestname, 4, 1, lt->handle);
         lt->longestname = rcf ? lxt2_rd_get_32(&lt->longestname, 0) : 0;
         rcf = fread(&lt->zfacnamesize, 4, 1, lt->handle);
         lt->zfacnamesize = rcf ? lxt2_rd_get_32(&lt->zfacnamesize, 0) : 0;
         rcf = fread(&lt->zfacname_predec_size, 4, 1, lt->handle);
         lt->zfacname_predec_size = rcf ? lxt2_rd_get_32(&lt->zfacname_predec_size, 0) : 0;
         rcf = fread(&lt->zfacgeometrysize, 4, 1, lt->handle);
         lt->zfacgeometrysize = rcf ? lxt2_rd_get_32(&lt->zfacgeometrysize, 0) : 0;
         rcf = fread(&lt->timescale, 1, 1, lt->handle);
         if (!rcf) lt->timescale = 0; /* no swap necessary */
         ...

```

Several fields are then read from the file [4]:

* `numfacs`: the number of facilities (elements in `facnames`)
* `numfacbytes`: unused
* `longestname`: keeps the longest length of all defined facilitiesâ€™ names
* `zfacnamesize`: compressed size of `facnames`
* `zfacname_predec_size`: decompressed size of `facnames`
* `zfacgeometrysize`: compressed size of `facgeometry`

Then, the `facnames` and `facgeometry` structures are extracted. Both structures are compressed with gzip.

For this advisory, weâ€™re interested in the extraction and parsing of `facgeometry`:

```
     fseeko(lt->handle, pos = pos + lt->zfacnamesize, SEEK_SET);
     /* fprintf(stderr, LXT2_RDLOAD"seeking to geometry at %d (0x%08x)\n", pos, pos); */
     lt->zhandle = gzdopen(dup(fileno(lt->handle)), "rb");

[5]  t = lt->numfacs * 4 * sizeof(lxtint32_t);
[6]  m = (char *)malloc(t);
[7]  rc = gzread(lt->zhandle, m, t);
     gzclose(lt->zhandle);
     lt->zhandle = NULL;
     if (rc != t) {
         fprintf(stderr, LXT2_RDLOAD "*** geometry section mangled %d (act) vs %d (exp)\n", rc, t);
         ...
     }

```

The decompressed `facgeometry` structure is pointed to by `m` [6] and decompressed at [7] using `gzread`. The decompressed size is expected to be `numfacs * 16` [5].

Each geometry has 4 fields associated: `rows`, `msb`, `lsb`, `flags`. These are extracted in the following code, together with `len` and `value` arrays, which are calculated based on the 4 fields just mentioned.

```
     ...
[8]  lt->rows = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(lxtint32_t));
[9]  lt->msb = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(lxtsint32_t));
[10] lt->lsb = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(lxtsint32_t));
[11] lt->flags = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(lxtint32_t));
[12] lt->len = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(lxtint32_t));
[13] lt->value = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(char *));
[14] lt->next_radix = malloc(lt->numfacs * sizeof(void *));

[15] for (i = 0; i < lt->numfacs; i++) {
[16]     lt->rows[i] = lxt2_rd_get_32(m + i * 16, 0);
[17]     lt->msb[i] = lxt2_rd_get_32(m + i * 16, 4);
[18]     lt->lsb[i] = lxt2_rd_get_32(m + i * 16, 8);
[19]     lt->flags[i] = lxt2_rd_get_32(m + i * 16, 12);

         if (!(lt->flags[i] & LXT2_RD_SYM_F_INTEGER)) {
[20]         lt->len[i] = (lt->msb[i] <= lt->lsb[i]) ? (lt->lsb[i] - lt->msb[i] + 1) : (lt->msb[i] - lt->lsb[i] + 1);
         } else {
[20]         lt->len[i] = 32;
         }
[21]     lt->value[i] = calloc(lt->len[i] + 1, sizeof(char));
     }
     ...

```

In the code above, there are 7 identical issues, only affecting 32-bit mode. The size of the buffers is calculated by multiplying `numfacs` by 4. When `numfacs` is bigger than 0x40000000, this multiplication will wrap around in 32-bit mode, leading to calling `malloc` with a smaller size.

Right after these allocations, thereâ€™s a loop over `numfacs` [15,] which writes to all of those allocated buffers, leading to multiple out-of-bound writes on heap. As `lt` is also allocated on heap, by carefully manipulating heap allocations, these out-of-bounds writes can be used to overwrite pointers inside `lt`, which can in turn be used to write to arbitrary locations. For this reason this issue can lead to arbitrary code execution.

We are not assigning a CVE for the `next_radix` allocation [14], even though the allocation size wraps around, because in order to exploit this issue successfully the allocations need to be exploited at the same time, as `next_radix` is written to only in later parsing functions of the LXT2 file.

#### CVE-2023-39270 - rows array allocation

The size for the `rows` array allocation [8] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [16].

#### CVE-2023-39271 - msb array allocation

The size for the `msb` array allocation [9] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [17].

#### CVE-2023-39272 - lsb array allocation

The size for the `lsb` array allocation [10] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [18].

#### CVE-2023-39273 - flags array allocation

The size for the `flags` array allocation [11] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [19].

#### CVE-2023-39274 - len array allocation

The size for the `len` array allocation [12] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [20].

#### CVE-2023-39275 - value array allocation

The size for the `value` array allocation [13] may wrap around, leading to an out-of-bounds write at [21].
