{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when calculating the size of the flags array, which results in an undersized buffer allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Integer Overflow",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution due to heap out-of-bounds write.",
  "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted .lxt2 file with GTKWave.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious .lxt2 file. The victim needs to open this file with a vulnerable GTKWave application. No special privileges are required."
