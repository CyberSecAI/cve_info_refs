{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The management interface of the SENEC.Inverter transmits security-critical data (authentication credentials) in cleartext.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319). Security-critical data, specifically authentication credentials, are transmitted without encryption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can sniff network traffic and intercept the cleartext credentials. This allows unauthorized access and control over the SENEC.Inverter device. It could lead to unauthorized access to the photovoltaic system and manipulation of settings.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network sniffing. The attacker needs to be able to monitor network traffic between the SENEC.Inverter and its management interface. This could occur on the local network or along the communication path to remote servers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to sniff network traffic, which could be achieved through a privileged position on the network, such as a compromised router, or simply access to the network where the device operates."
