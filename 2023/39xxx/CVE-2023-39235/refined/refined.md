  "cve": "CVE-2023-39235",
  "description": "Multiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities exist in the VZT vzt_rd_process_block autosort functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .vzt file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `vzt_rd_process_block` function, specifically when sorting wave value changes. The `autosort` array is allocated based on `b->num_time_ticks`. However, the index `i2` used to write to this array is derived from the `change_dict` and can be controlled via the input file, allowing out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-129 - Improper Validation of Array Index",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by exploiting the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted .vzt file is needed, which upon opening by a victim triggers the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .vzt file and convince the victim to open it with a vulnerable version of GTKWave."
