{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input when rendering data source debugging information in the `data_debug.php` script. Specifically, the `$real_path` variable, which can be manipulated by an attacker, is directly rendered without any escaping, allowing for the execution of malicious JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Cacti database, which gets executed when an administrator views the debugging information in `data_debug.php`. This can lead to:\n  - Victim-account takeover\n  - Performing arbitrary actions on the platform as the victim user\n  - Redirecting the user to a malicious website\n  - Phishing for sensitive information\n  - Running browser-related exploits\n  - Joining the browser to a botnet.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the web interface of Cacti. An attacker with \"General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data\" privileges can configure the data source path with a malicious payload. A victim with access to `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php` (Resource Path: *Troubleshooting>Data Sources*) triggers the exploit by viewing the debug page for a poisoned data source.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated Cacti user with 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions to inject the malicious payload and any authenticated Cacti user with access to 'Troubleshooting>Data Sources' is a potential victim. The attack requires user interaction (victim needs to view the debug page for the malicious data source)."
