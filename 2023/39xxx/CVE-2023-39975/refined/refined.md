  "cve": "CVE-2023-39975",
  "description": "kdc/do_tgs_req.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.21 before 1.21.2 has a double free that is reachable if an authenticated user can trigger an authorization-data handling failure. Incorrect data is copied from one ticket to another.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.21 before 1.21.2"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a double-free error in the KDC TGS processing. When issuing a ticket for a TGS renew or validate request, the code copies the entire header ticket structure, including the `enc_part` pointer. This causes the `enc_part` pointer to be aliased to the header ticket until `krb5_encrypt_tkt_part()` is called. If `handle_authdata()` fails, a double-free occurs when attempting to free the same pointer twice.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Double-free vulnerability."
  ],
  "impact": "An authenticated attacker can cause a KDC to free the same pointer twice, which may result in a denial of service (DoS) and potentially lead to disclosure of sensitive information and data modification.",
  "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker who can trigger a failure in authorization data handling can exploit this vulnerability.",
  "patch_info": {
    "mitigation": "Copy only the server field from the outer part of the header ticket to the new ticket, instead of the whole structure.",
