Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Broken Access Control

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
*   **Weaknesses:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms. This can include insufficient checks for user roles, permissions, or session validity before allowing execution of certain functions.
*   **Impact:** The impact is that an attacker with low privileges (subscriber) can execute actions they are not authorized to perform, potentially leading to unauthorized modification of data or functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve a subscriber user attempting to execute a function that is intended for higher privileged users. This can potentially happen via direct requests or by using vulnerabilities in the application interface.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a subscriber account (low privilege) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
