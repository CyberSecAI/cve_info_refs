{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `net.bramp.ffmpeg.FFmpeg` constructor directly executes the provided path as an external command during object initialization, without sufficient validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute malicious code by providing a crafted path to the constructor, if a developer allows user-controlled input to specify the ffmpeg path.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The application executes the provided path directly, resulting in the execution of attacker-controlled code.",
        "An attacker can control the `ffmpeg` path passed to the constructor."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the `ffmpeg` path parameter of the `net.bramp.ffmpeg.FFmpeg` constructor."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is disputed, as it is by design that the user provides a path to the binary they wish to call. There are no realistic use cases in which `FFmpeg.java` uses untrusted input for the path of the executable file. It's also argued that the user of this library is the developer who should know that providing a path to an executable will eventually result in that executable being invoked. However, an argument was made that in some cases developers might allow users to control parts of the path (e.g. version of ffmpeg). Also, the direct execution happens during object instantiation, which is unnecessary.",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2023-39018"
