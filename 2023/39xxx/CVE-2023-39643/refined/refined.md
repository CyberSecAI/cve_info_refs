Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `SearchApiXml::Xmlfeeds()` method of the "XML Feeds PRO" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module does not properly sanitize the `$selected_products` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly includes user-supplied input (`$selected_products`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive information from the database, including customer data, admin credentials, and other confidential data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain admin access to the PrestaShop installation.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Webskimmer Deployment:** The exploit is actively used to deploy a webskimmer to steal credit card details.
- **Hijacking Emails:** Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Exposing Tokens:** Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to front to expose tokens.
- **Unlocking Adminsâ€™ Ajax Scripts:** Allows access to admin ajax scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network using HTTP requests.
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a simple HTTP request to `/modules/xmlfeeds/search.php` with a malicious `s_p` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or login to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 3.8.2 and earlier of the "XML Feeds PRO" module.
- The fix implemented in version 3.9.8 sanitizes the `$selected_products` parameter by using `implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', $selected_products)))` to ensure that only integer values are used in the query.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code using a specially crafted HTTP request.
