Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-39355:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `freerdp_bitmap_planar_context_reset` function in `libfreerdp/codec/planar.c`. If the `maxPlaneSize` is calculated as 0, the `planesBuffer` is freed, but the `context->planesBuffer` pointer isn't updated, leading to a use-after-free condition when it is later accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The code frees the memory pointed to by `context->planesBuffer` but doesn't nullify the pointer itself. A subsequent operation attempts to use the freed memory leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate consequence of the use-after-free is a crash of the FreeRDP client. The provided information suggests that in most environments this will only lead to a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS packets:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specific RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS packets.
    - The first `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packet needs to have either `height` or `width` set to 0. This will trigger the `context->maxPlaneSize` to be calculated as 0 leading to the `planesBuffer` being freed.
    - A second `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packet is sent, which then tries to access the freed `context->planesBuffer`, triggering the UAF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **RDP Server:** The attacker needs to be in a position to send manipulated RDP packets to a vulnerable FreeRDP client. This would usually be in the form of a malicious RDP server.
- **Client Interaction:** The attacker needs to establish an RDP session to a vulnerable client.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects FreeRDP clients only, as the image decoding is not performed by a proxy.
- The vulnerability affects FreeRDP versions on the 3.x release branch before beta3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.0-beta3.
