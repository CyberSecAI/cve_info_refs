- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The management interface of SENEC inverters is publicly accessible via the internet, which is recommended by the manufacturer for remote maintenance. This exposes the devices to potential exploitation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Publicly accessible management interface via the internet
    - Improper restriction of communication channel to intended endpoints (CWE-923)
    - Exploitation of hard-coded credentials identified in CVE-2023-39168 and CVE-2023-39169.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Complete compromise of devices accessible on the internet.
    - Ability to shut down or damage devices through targeted overload.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Internet-based exploitation
    - Use of IoT search engines such as Shodan, Censys, or ZoomEye to identify vulnerable devices.
    - Exploitation of the SENEC.Inverter's built-in API using previously identified hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to identify vulnerable devices via IoT search engines.
    - Knowledge of or access to the hardcoded credentials (CVE-2023-39168 and CVE-2023-39169).
    - Ability to access the device through the publicly available interface.
