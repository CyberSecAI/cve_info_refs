## Apache Airflow has a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-pxch-wr7m-rwxj/dependabot)

## Package

pip

apache-airflow
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.6.0, <= 2.7.3

## Patched versions

2.8.0b1

## Description

Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-sanitized javascript in the parameter description field of the DAG. This Javascript can be executed on the client side of any of the user who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users.

Users of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Significant Changes

* Raw HTML code in DAG docs and DAG params descriptions is disabled by default

  To ensure that no malicious javascript can be injected with DAG descriptions or trigger UI forms by DAG authors

  a new parameter `webserver.allow_raw_html_descriptions` was added with default value of `False`.

  If you trust your DAG authors code and want to allow using raw HTML in DAG descriptions and params, you can restore the previous

  behavior by setting the configuration value to `True`.

  To ensure Airflow is secure by default, the raw HTML support in trigger UI has been super-seeded by markdown support via

  the `description_md` attribute. If you have been using `description_html` please migrate to `description_md`.

  The `custom_html_form` is now deprecated. ([#35460](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35460))

### @jscheffl **[jscheffl](/jscheffl)** commented [Nov 5, 2023](#issue-1977891361)

With AIP-50 we introduced trigger forms and such trigger forms allow to provide raw HTML by DAG authors as descriptions.

During Airflow Summit there were some concerns discussed whether a DAG author would be able to inject dangerous JavaScript into the HTML and how Airflow handles this.

This PR changes the raw HTML support in Airflow in the way:

* A new configuration option `allow_html_in_dag_docs` is added, which defaults to False
* DAG documentation and Params Descriptions allow raw HTML only based on the server config option
* As alternative for safe but still custom text formatting MD is now supported for parameter descriptions
* Markdown also in DAG description is now filtering HTML tags by default
* The `custom_html_form` in trigger DAG UI is marked as deprecated for a future / better solution
* Example DAGs have been adjusted from raw HTML to MD descriptions where used.

Sorry, something went wrong.
