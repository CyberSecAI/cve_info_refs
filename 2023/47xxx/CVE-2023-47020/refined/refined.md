Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities that can be chained together. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in an undisclosed function within the WSDL of the NCR Terminal Handler v.1.5.1. This function lacks sufficient security controls and improperly handles custom content types, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.
*   **Lack of security controls in WSDL function:** An undisclosed function in the WSDL lacks necessary security checks and is susceptible to manipulation.
*   **Improper handling of custom content types:** The vulnerable function does not validate or sanitize custom content types, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By chaining multiple CSRF requests, an attacker can create a new user account and add that user to an administrator group, gaining unauthorized administrative privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted request:** Attackers must craft malicious requests targeting the vulnerable WSDL function.
*   **Chaining:** The vulnerability requires chaining multiple CSRF attacks together.
*   **User interaction**: Likely needs interaction from a user who already has privileges on the application to create new users or update group memberships.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft and send requests to the NCR Terminal Handler application.
*   The attacker likely needs a user session with some level of privilege to perform the full attack chain.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the undisclosed function in the WSDL that lacks security controls.
