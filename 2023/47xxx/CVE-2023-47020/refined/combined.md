## Description

Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) chaining in NCR Terminal Handler v.1.5.1 allows privileges to be escalated by an attacker through a crafted request involving user account creation and adding the user to an administrator group. This is exploited by an undisclosed function in the WSDL that lacks security controls and can accept custom content types.
