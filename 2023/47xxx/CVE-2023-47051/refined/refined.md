Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-47051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   A heap-based buffer overflow exists within Adobe Audition. This means that the program writes data beyond the allocated memory on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system running Adobe Audition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Low privileges (PR:L) are sufficient to trigger the vulnerability, indicating a local user can exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is required, the exploit can occur without any user prompt or action.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by a local attacker with low privileges, leading to arbitrary code execution without user interaction.
