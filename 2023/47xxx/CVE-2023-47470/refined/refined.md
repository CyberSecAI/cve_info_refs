Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `ff_evc_parse_sps` function within the `libavcodec/evc_ps.c` file of the FFmpeg project. Specifically, it involves missing checks on the values of `ref_pic_num` and `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` parameters during parsing of the EVC (Essential Video Coding) stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The code reads `ref_pic_num` from the bitstream and uses it as an index into an array. However, if `ref_pic_num` is greater than `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1`, an out-of-bounds access occurs, resulting in memory corruption and potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
2.  **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate whether `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` is within a reasonable bound. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access when `ref_pic_num` is used later on, or even lead to integer overflows when parsing the stream.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Memory corruption:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to out-of-bounds memory access, which can corrupt memory, cause application crashes, or potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
-   **Denial of Service:**  A malformed EVC stream could cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Maliciously Crafted EVC Streams:** An attacker can craft a specially designed EVC stream where `ref_pic_num` and/or  `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` values are set to trigger the out-of-bounds access. This stream would then need to be processed by FFmpeg.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to provide an EVC stream as input to an application using the vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
-   The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was found by `dongsookim@korea.ac.kr`.
-   The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `ref_pic_num` is less than or equal to `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` and that `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` is within a valid range.
-   The commit also includes error handling, so that a parsing error is raised in case of an invalid value.
