### Rationale for this change

PyExtensionType autoload is really a misfeature. It creates PyArrow-specific extension types, though using ExtensionType is almost the same complexity while allowing deserialization from non-PyArrow software.

### What changes are included in this PR?

* Disable PyExtensionType autoloading and deprecate PyExtensionType instantiation.
* Update the docs to emphasize ExtensionType.

### Are these changes tested?

Yes.

### Are there any user-facing changes?

Yes.

* Closes: [#38607](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38607)

|  |  | Pyarrow allows you to define such extension types from Python. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | There are currently two ways: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Subclassing :class:`PyExtensionType`: the (de)serialization is based on pickle. |
|  |  | This is a good option for an extension type that is only used from Python. |
|  |  | \* Subclassing :class:`ExtensionType`: this allows to give a custom |
|  |  | Python-independent name and serialized metadata, that can potentially be |
|  |  | recognized by other (non-Python) Arrow implementations such as PySpark. |
|  |  | Pyarrow allows you to define such extension types from Python by subclassing |
|  |  | :class:`ExtensionType` and giving the derived class its own extension name |
|  |  | and serialization mechanism. The extension name and serialized metadata |
|  |  | can potentially be recognized by other (non-Python) Arrow implementations |
|  |  | such as PySpark. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For example, we could define a custom UUID type for 128-bit numbers which can |
|  |  | be represented as ``FixedSizeBinary`` type with 16 bytes. |
|  |  | Using the first approach, we create a ``UuidType`` subclass, and implement the |
|  |  | ``\_\_reduce\_\_`` method to ensure the class can be properly pickled:: |
|  |  | be represented as ``FixedSizeBinary`` type with 16 bytes:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | class UuidType(pa.PyExtensionType): |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | def \_\_init\_\_(self): |
|  |  | pa.PyExtensionType.\_\_init\_\_(self, pa.binary(16)) |
|  |  | super().\_\_init\_\_(pa.binary(16), "my\_package.uuid") |

|  |  | assert storage\_type == pa.binary(16) |
|  |  | assert serialized == b'' |
|  |  | # Return an instance of this subclass given the serialized |
|  |  | # metadata. |
|  |  | return UuidType() |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The special methods ``\_\_arrow\_ext\_serialize\_\_`` and ``\_\_arrow\_ext\_deserialize\_\_`` |

|  |  | This is a slightly longer implementation (you need to implement the special |

Fedora Update Notification

Name : python-geopandas
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 0.14.1
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopandas>
Summary : Geographic Pandas extensions
Description :
GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to Pandas objects.

The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in Python easier.
It combines the capabilities of Pandas and Shapely, providing geospatial
operations in Pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to
Shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in Python that would
otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.

Name : python-geopandas

Description :
GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to Pandas objects.

Shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in Python that would
otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.

GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to Pandas objects.

## Description

This is a hotfix for the PyArrow security vulnerability
[CVE-2023-47248](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47248).

We generally recommend upgrading to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later, but if you
cannot upgrade, this package disables the vulnerability on older versions.

## Installation

Use pip to install:

```
pip install pyarrow_hotfix
```

Note

Both pyarrow-hotfix and pyarrow\_hotfix are accepted and point to
the same package.

## Usage

pyarrow\_hotfix must be imported in your application or library code for
it to take effect:

```
import pyarrow_hotfix
```

## Supported versions

pyarrow\_hotfix supports all Python versions starting from Python 3.5,
and all PyArrow versions starting from 0.14.0.

## Dependencies

pyarrow\_hotfix is a pure Python package that does not have any explicit
dependencies, and assumes you have installed pyarrow through other means
(such as pip or conda).

## Example

```
>>> import pyarrow as pa
>>> import pyarrow_hotfix
>>>
>>> pa.ipc.open_file('data.arrow')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  [ ... ]
RuntimeError: forbidden deserialization of 'arrow.py_extension_type': storage_type = null, serialized = b"\x80\x03cbuiltins\neval\nq\x00X\x15\x00\x00\x00print('hello world!')q\x01\x85q\x02Rq\x03.", pickle disassembly:
