Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-47250 and CVE-2023-47251 found in m-privacy TightGate-Pro:

**CVE-2023-47250: Access to all Desktops**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure permissions on X11 sockets. TightGate-Pro uses a single X11 window system instance for multiple users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Normal users have read and write access to all X11 sockets located in the temp directory.
*  **Impact:** Any user can open arbitrary windows on the desktops of other users. This allows for phishing attacks or the installation of keyloggers to capture sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation occurs through local access to the vulnerable TightGate-Pro server. Any user with a session on the server can exploit this.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the TightGate-Pro server.

**CVE-2023-47251: File Transfer by Abusing the Print Function**

*   **Root Cause:**  The print function allows transferring PDF files to the host system, but it doesn't properly validate the file path.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can control the path where transferred files are stored and prevent their automatic deletion.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can transfer files to arbitrary locations on the host system, potentially leading to arbitrary file write, data exfiltration or the introduction of malware. This also bypasses the intended file transfer mechanism.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploited through the print function within a TightGate-Pro VNC session.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the TightGate-Pro server.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Code Execution (Not a CVE):**  While not directly related to the CVEs, the advisory also mentions that users can execute arbitrary shell commands through the "Open with" context menu. This is considered intended behavior by the vendor for bash scripts, but is still a potential risk.
*   **Outdated Update Server:** The update server uses an old, vulnerable version of `thttpd`. While the vendor claims this is mitigated by other security measures and requires SSH key authentication, it represents a potential attack vector.
*   **Affected Versions:**  TightGate-Pro servers with the following package versions are vulnerable: `tightgatevnc < 4.1.2~1`, `rsbac-policy-tgpro < 2.0.159`, and `mprivacy-tools < 2.0.406g`.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerabilities are addressed in the following package versions and higher: `mprivacy-tools_2.0.406g`, `tightgatevnc_4.1.2~1`, and `rsbac-policy-tgpro_2.0.159`.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor has released a patch that should be installed immediately.
