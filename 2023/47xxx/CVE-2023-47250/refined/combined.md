# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

TightGate-Pro

Simple, secure & certified

# Safe surfing on the Internet

Safe surfing on the Internet is becoming increasingly difficult, as cyber criminals have long specialised in attacking computer networks more or less specifically via the web browser.
Traditional protection measures hardly protect against attacks any more, as attackers often exploit security gaps in web browsers. But it doesn’t have to come to the point of compromising individual workstations or even entire networks. Use TightGate-Pro, a strong security component, and you will be surfing the Internet safely again. **You can find out all about TightGate-Pro in the video series “Distance creates security”.**

## TightGate-Pro! ... and how it protects

TightGate-Pro is a ReCoB system. ReCoBS stands for Remote-Controlled Browser System, literally translated “remote-controlled web browser”. TightGate-Pro physically separates the web browser execution environment from the workstation. The system thus shields the internal network from the Internet and reliably and preventively prevents attacks via the web browser. TightGate-Pro is the strongest dedicated ReCoBS, because only physical outsourcing on a hardened system permanently withstands attacks. Local virtualisations, sandboxing systems or micro-virtualisations do not offer effective protection. TightGate-Pro is used in public authorities, financial institutions, industrial companies and critical infrastructures – in short, everywhere where “safe surfing on the Internet” is indispensable at the workplace and internal infrastructures must be reliably protected. **TightGate-Pro is BSI-certified according to EAL3+.**
[For further reading: The TightGate protection concept >](https://www.m-privacy.de/en/tightgate-protection-concept/)

## How TightGate-Pro works

With TightGate-Pro, the Firefox and Chrome browsers are made available to users in the TightGate-Pro secure environment. The browser can be controlled like a local browser with mouse and keyboard. The display of the screen output as well as the sound output take place on the monitor or loudspeaker of the workstation computer. At the same time, the virtual browser can be controlled remotely from the workstation via mouse and keyboard. The “look & feel” with TightGate-Pro makes no difference to a local browser, but security in the network gets a big boost.

## Video series on TightGate-Pro

**1. Attack from the Internet (in German)**Most attacks from the internet on workstations occur via the web browser. However, common filtering systems only look for known attack patterns and new or targeted attacks usually get past these security systems undetected. In the first part of our video series, you will learn where the immanent problems of all common web browsers lie and why classic security systems are not sufficient.

**2. Danger averted with TightGate-Pro (in German)**
TightGate-Pro is the secure web browser for public authorities and companies. It runs on hardened servers outside the internal network. This is crucial because the physical separation of the internal corporate network from the open internet is the only truly secure method of keeping attackers and malicious code out.

**3. The TightGate protection concept (in German)**
With the TightGate protection concept, m-privacy GmbH describes a solution approach for making a company’s data traffic secure and functional. A local browser is used for trustworthy remote sites, and TightGate-Pro is used for websites outside the protected area.

## BSI certification

TightGate-Pro (CC) Ver. 1.4 is the variant of TightGate-Pro designed for use in particularly sensitive environments. TightGate-Pro (CC) has been certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-DSZ-CC-0589) according to Common Criteria EAL 3+. This gives you maximum protection and allows you to surf the Internet safely.
[Read the press release >](https://ftp.m-privacy.de/Presse/2016/PM-01-2016-BSI-Zertifizierung.pdf)
**EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-DSGVO)**
TightGate-Pro fully complies with the EU-DSGVO. The system offers comprehensive data protection through technology (Privacy by Design) and always works with data protection-friendly default settings (Privacy by Default). TightGate-Pro thus stands for legal certainty in data protection – today and in the future.

## Fragen zu "Sicher surfen im Internet"

Does TightGate-Pro make other protection systems superfluous?

No, TightGate-Pro is to be seen as a component of a holistic security concept. The individual components complement each other to increase the level of protection of the infrastructure as a whole.

Since TightGate-Pro has a particularly high protective effect for the internal network, other filtering protection systems can be dispensed with if necessary.

Is TightGate-Pro suitable for large organisations?

Yes, processing large numbers of users is not a problem for TightGate-Pro.

TightGate-Pro is suitable for user groups of 10 workstations or more and is scalable to almost any number of users. For higher numbers of users, powerful interconnected computers (cluster systems) are used.

For the administration of several TightGate-Pro servers, there is the [central TightGate administration (ZenTiV)](https://www.m-privacy.de/en/zentiv-central-tightgate-management/).

Can all multimedia content be used with TightGate-Pro?

Yes, multimedia content can be played back without delay.

All common multimedia data on the Internet can be played back with TightGate-Pro and that smoothly in picture and sound.

What system requirements does TightGate-Pro need?

TightGate-Pro can be integrated quickly and easily into almost any professional network infrastructure.

TightGate-Pro can be operated as a physical server or virtualised machine as long as it is ensured that TightGate-Pro is located in a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) outside the internal network

TightGate-Pro has no special requirements for the equipment of the workstation PCs, as only the TightGate client programmes (<30 MB) need to be installed.

Where can I get TightGate-Pro?

You can get TightGate-Pro directly from m-privacy GmbH or simply ask your system vendor.

What does TightGate-Pro cost?

TightGate-Pro is delivered as a pre-installed and configured system. The licence costs are based solely on the number of concurrent users and are staggered according to the total number of users. In the case of physical servers, there are additional costs for hardware and, in any case, annual software maintenance.

The TightGate-Pro solution offers a secure remote browser which does not run on your own devices but on a remote server which can be accessed by VNC. The goal is to prevent the host device of the user from being attacked. There are several vulnerabilities in the server which enables attackers to view the VNC sessions of other users, infect the VNC session with keyloggers and start internal phishing attacks. Additionally, a TightGate-Pro administrator can push malicious PDFs to the endpoint of the user. Furthermore, the update servers which are only reachable via an SSH-tunnel are severely outdated (2003).

*"TightGate-Pro is a ReCoB system. ReCoBS stands for Remote-Controlled Browser System, literally translated 'remote-controlled web browser'. TightGate-Pro physically separates the web browser execution environment from the workstation. The system thus shields the internal network from the Internet and reliably and preventively prevents attacks via the web browser. TightGate-Pro is the strongest dedicated ReCoBS, because only physical outsourcing on a hardened system permanently withstands attacks. Local virtualisations, sandboxing systems or micro-virtualisations do not offer effective protection. TightGate-Pro is used in public authorities, financial institutions, industrial companies and critical infrastructures – in short, everywhere where “safe surfing on the Internet” is indispensable at the workplace and internal infrastructures must be reliably protected. TightGate-Pro is BSI-certified according to EAL3+."*

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Code Execution

Execution of single commands and scripts is possible with the privileges of the current user. Code execution is possible with any file type on the server and no specific permissions need to be set for the utilized file.

Vendor response (translated):
*"It is intended behavior to execute arbitrary bash scripts. It is not possible to execute arbitrary programs and libraries. There is no privilege escalation possible with this vulnerability."*

We can confirm that it was not possible to escalate privileges during our test.

### 2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)

Multiple users are connecting to the same TightGate-Pro server, resulting in one instance of the X11 window system. Due to insecure permissions of the X11 sockets it is possible for any user to open arbitrary windows on the desktop of other users for phishing attacks or installing a keylogger directly.

Vendor response (translated):
*"We acknowledge this issue as a important vulnerability. A fix with full RSBAC-Jail-Separation and changed Linux-Filesystem permissions is currently available in the "Prestable" packages:*

* mprivacy-tools\_2.0.406g
* tightgatevnc\_4.1.2~1
* rsbac-policy-tgpro\_2.0.159

*These can be applied by the admin user "update". The updates will be provided automatically as Hotfix around 2023-10-24."*

### 3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)

TightGate-Pro allows printing PDF documents on the host system. Documents are transferred to the host, printed and deleted afterwards. An attacker is able to control the path of the transferred file and to prevent the automatic deletion of the file.

Vendor response (translated):
*"This is not a severe finding but we already fixed it. The fixes are available in the packages:*

* mprivacy-tools\_2.0.406g
* tightgatevnc\_4.1.2~1

*Now the .spool directly is always scanned for malicious data and the VNC- client does not transfer files which contain path symbols (e.g. ../)."*

### 4) Outdated Update Server

Based on disclosed version numbers the update server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities. The criticality of this issue depends on the exploitability of these issues.

Vendor response (translated):
*"The old version of thttpd is already known. This is not seen as security-relevant. The access to the updateserver requires a previous registration of a customer-provided SSH key, which is only available to administrators on the TightGate-Pro instance. thttpd is isolated on the updateserver and can only \*read\* files. Even if an attacker can write malicious updatepackages, these are still secured by a cryptographic signature and would not be installed on TightGate-Pro instances. We will eventually replace thttpd with lighthttpd which is still supported."*

## Proof of concept

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-ce_open_with.png)

Context menu "Open with" dialog

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-ce_custom_command.png)

Selecting "custom commandline"

### 1) Code Execution

Code execution is possible using the context menu of any file in the VNC session of TightGate-Pro. Selecting "Öffnen mit" (Open with) in the context menu of any file and  selecting the "Benutzerdefinierte Befehlszeile" (custom commandline) section of the menu allows to provide a custom shell command to be executed:

At this point there are two possible options:
 In case the selected file is a bash script typing `/bin/bash` as custom command will execute the script. For this PoC the following script has been used:

```
#!bin/bash
echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt
```

In case any other file is selected a complete command can be used as well. A possible example is listed below:

```
/bin/bash -c "echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt"
```

According to vendor, arbitrary code execution is not possible as programs and libraries won't be executed.

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-desktop_access_x11_perms.png)

Insecure permissions allow attackers with standard roles to access other desktops

### 2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)

A normal user without special permissions has read and write access to all X11 sockets stored in the temp folder of the user TightGate-Pro, visible in the following screenshot:

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-desktop_access_gui_triggered.png)

Attackers are able to open dialog boxes of other users.

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-desktop_access_result.png)

Accessing entered data of the victim.

This allows any user for example to open dialogue boxes on the desktop of the currently connected users as shown in the following screenshots. The command used is listed below.

```
/bin/bash -c 'for i in $(ls /home/tmpdir/tmp510/.X11-unix | cut -b 2-); do
DISPLAY=unix:"$i".0 zenity --password --username & done;
```

As it can be seen in the second screenshot, any input to the dialogue boxes can be read by the attacker.

### 3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)

File transfers can be triggered for PDF files which are stored in the `/home/user/.spool/<username>` directory. By setting a relative path as file name, the file can be stored in any user directory on the host system.

In case the file name contains Unicode characters, deletion of the file is not executed after transfer and closing of the print prompt. To store a file on the user's desktop, the name `..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf` can be used. The transfer can then be triggered by sending the signal `SIGUSR2` to the `Xtightgatevnc` process:

```
cp eicar.pdf '/home/user/.spool/<username>/..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf'
pkill -u $USER --signal SIGUSR2 Xtightgatevnc
```
![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-file_transfer_mal_file.png)

File transfer of malicious files.

In addition, this file transfer does not check if any malicious files are transferred to the host system. The following screenshot shows the warning of a malware scanner after an eicar testfile was transferred. It is therefore possible to circumvent the malware scanner of TightGate-Pro which only runs if the intended way of transfer, namely the TightGate-Schleuse, is used.

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_11/sec-consult-c-tightgate-outdated_server.png.png)

Outdated webserver

### 4) Outdated Update Server

Access to the update server is possible with the ssh key stored at `/etc/cu/id\_ed25519` and ssh port forwarding. The ssh key is customized for each customer. Root access is needed to retrieve the key. The command used for the forwarding is listed below:

```
ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:85 tgpro13@update.m-privacy.de -i id_ed25519 -v
```

Afterwards access is possible at `http:127.0.0.1:8000`. The server headers return the version of the webserver:

```
thttpd/2.25b 29dec2003
```

This version has in sum four known vulnerabilities (high and medium) listed:

* CVE-2006-1078
* CVE-2006-1079
* CVE-2007-0664
* CVE-2009-4491

## Vulnerable / tested versions

A TightGate-Pro server with the following package versions was used for testing:

* tightgatevnc < 4.1.2~1
* rsbac-policy-tgpro < 2.0.159
* mprivacy-tools < 2.0.406g

Vendor description:
-------------------
"TightGate-Pro is a ReCoB system. ReCoBS stands for Remote-Controlled Browser
System, literally translated 'remote-controlled web browser'. TightGate-Pro
physically separates the web browser execution environment from the workstation.
The system thus shields the internal network from the Internet and reliably
and preventively prevents attacks via the web browser. TightGate-Pro is the
strongest dedicated ReCoBS, because only physical outsourcing on a hardened
system permanently withstands attacks. Local virtualisations, sandboxing
systems or micro-virtualisations do not offer effective protection.
TightGate-Pro is used in public authorities, financial institutions, industrial
companies and critical infrastructures – in short, everywhere where “safe
surfing on the Internet” is indispensable at the workplace and internal
infrastructures must be reliably protected. TightGate-Pro is BSI-certified
according to EAL3+."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Code Execution
Execution of single commands and scripts is possible with the privileges of
the current user. Code execution is possible with any file type on the
server and no specific permissions need to be set for the utilized file.

Vendor response (translated):
"It is intended behavior to execute arbitrary bash scripts. It is not possible
to execute arbitrary programs and libraries. There is no privilege escalation
possible with this vulnerability."

We can confirm that it was not possible to escalate privileges during our test.

2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)
Multiple users are connecting to the same TightGate-Pro server, resulting in
one instance of the X11 window system. Due to insecure permissions of the
X11 sockets it is possible for any user to open arbitrary windows on the
desktop of other users for phishing attacks or installing a keylogger
directly.

Vendor response (translated):
"We acknowledge this issue as a important vulnerability. A fix with full
RSBAC-Jail-Separation and changed Linux-Filesystem permissions is currently
available in the "Prestable" packages:
- mprivacy-tools_2.0.406g
- tightgatevnc_4.1.2~1
- rsbac-policy-tgpro_2.0.159
These can be applied by the admin user "update". The updates will be provided
automatically as Hotfix around 2023-10-24."

3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)
TightGate-Pro allows printing PDF documents on the host system. Documents are
transferred to the host, printed and deleted afterwards. An attacker is able
to control the path of the transferred file and to prevent the automatic
deletion of the file.

Vendor response (translated):
"This is not a severe finding but we already fixed it. The fixes are available
in the packages:
- mprivacy-tools_2.0.406g
- tightgatevnc_4.1.2~1

Now the .spool directly is always scanned for malicious data and the VNC- client
does not transfer files which contain path symbols (e.g. ../)."

4) Outdated Update Server
Based on disclosed version numbers the update server is running outdated software
with known vulnerabilities. The criticality of this issue depends on the
exploitability of these issues.

Vendor response (translated):
"The old version of thttpd is already known. This is not seen as security-relevant.
The access to the updateserver requires a previous registration of a customer-
provided SSH key, which is only available to administrators on the TightGate-Pro
instance. thttpd is isolated on the updateserver and can only *read* files.

Even if an attacker can write malicious updatepackages, these are still secured
by a cryptographic signature and would not be installed on TightGate-Pro instances.
We will eventually replace thttpd with lighthttpd which is still supported."

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Code Execution
Code execution is possible using the context menu of any file in the VNC session
of TightGate-Pro. Selecting "Öffnen mit" (Open with) in the context menu of any
file and  selecting the "Benutzerdefinierte Befehlszeile" (custom commandline)
section of the menu allows to provide a custom shell command to be executed:

[advisory_ce_open_with.png]
[advisory_ce_custom_command.png]

At this point there are two possible options:
In case the selected file is a bash script typing `/bin/bash` as custom command
will execute the script. For this PoC the following script has been used:

```
#!bin/bash
echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt
```

In case any other file is selected a complete command can be used as well.
A possible example is listed below:
`/bin/bash -c "echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt"`

According to vendor, arbitrary code execution is not possible as programs and
libraries won't be executed.

2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)
A normal user without special permissions has read and write access to all X11
sockets stored in the temp folder of the user TightGate-Pro, visible in the
following screenshot:

[advisory_desktop_access_x11_perms.png]

This allows any user for example to open dialogue boxes on the desktop of the
currently connected users as shown in the following screenshots. The command
used is listed below.

`/bin/bash -c 'for i in $(ls /home/tmpdir/tmp510/.X11-unix | cut -b 2-); do
DISPLAY=unix:"$i".0 zenity --password --username & done;'`

[advisory_desktop_access_gui_triggered.png]

As it can be seen in the following screenshot any input to the dialogue boxes
can be read by the attacker.

[advisory_desktop_access_result.png]

3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)
File transfers can be triggered for PDF files which are stored in the
`/home/user/.spool/<username>` directory. By setting a relative path as file
name, the file can be stored in any user directory on the host system.
In case the file name contains Unicode characters, deletion of the file is
not executed after transfer and closing of the print prompt. To store a file
on the user's desktop, the name `..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf`
can be used. The transfer can then be triggered by sending the
signal `SIGUSR2` to the `Xtightgatevnc` process:

```
cp eicar.pdf '/home/user/.spool/<username>/..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf'
pkill -u $USER --signal SIGUSR2 Xtightgatevnc
```

In addition, this file transfer does not check if any malicious files are
transferred to the host system. The following screenshot shows the warning of
a malware scanner after an eicar testfile was transferred. It is therefore
possible to circumvent the malware scanner of TightGate-Pro which only runs
if the intended way of transfer, namely the TightGate-Schleuse, is used.

[advisory_file_transfer_mal_file.png]

4) Outdated Update Server
Access to the update server is possible with the ssh key stored at
`/etc/cu/id_ed25519` and ssh port forwarding. The ssh key is customized
for each customer. Root access is needed to retrieve the key.
The command used for the forwarding is listed below:

```
ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:85 tgpro13 () update m-privacy de -i id_ed25519 -v
```

Afterwards access is possible at `http:127.0.0.1:8000`.
The server headers return the version of the webserver:
`thttpd/2.25b 29dec2003`

[advisory_outdated_server.png]

This version has in sum four known vulnerabilities (high and medium) listed:
* CVE-2006-1078
* CVE-2006-1079
* CVE-2007-0664
* CVE-2009-4491

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
A TightGate-Pro server with the following package versions was used
for testing:

* tightgatevnc < 4.1.2~1
* rsbac-policy-tgpro < 2.0.159
* mprivacy-tools < 2.0.406g

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2023-10-11: Contacting vendor through info () m-privacy de via GPG
2023-10-13: CEO of m-privacy phones us and thanks us for the advisory,
             a developer will send us a written statement next week.
2023-10-16: Received a written statement of their lead developer;
             the vulnerabilities #2 (Access to all Desktops) and
             #3 (File Transfer by Abusing the Print function) are
             confirmed and a fix is available
             #1 is seen as a feature not a bug, #4 is claimed to be
             prevented by hardening measures on the server, also
             thttpd will be replaced by lighthttpd in the future.
2023-10-24: We ask for some clarifications regarding software
             versions and advisory publication date.
2023-10-29: Vendor provides software version information and asks us
             to publish the advisory after 2023-11-06.
2023-11-22: Public release of security advisory.
