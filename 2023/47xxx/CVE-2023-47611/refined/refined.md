- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a local, low-privileged attacker to elevate privileges to "manufacturer" level.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local, low-privileged attacker to elevate privileges to "manufacturer" level on the targeted system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low-privileged access to the target system.
