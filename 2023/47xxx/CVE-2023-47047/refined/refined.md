Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-47047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Access of Uninitialized Pointer

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from the software attempting to use a pointer that has not been properly initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. Specifically, a read operation might try to access memory using the uninitialized pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the affected system.
*   **Memory Leak:** The document notes that the same vulnerability (Access of Uninitialized Pointer) can also lead to a memory leak.

**Attack Vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the arbitrary code execution vulnerability. The memory leak vulnerability requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have low privilege access (PR:L) on the system, meaning they could be a standard user. User interaction is not required (UI:N) for this attack.
*   **Memory Leak:** The attacker requires no privilege (PR:N) but needs user interaction (UI:R).

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (for arbitrary code execution) and CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (for memory leak). This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited locally with low privileges, is of high impact, and does not require user interaction for the arbitrary code execution variant. The memory leak variant, is also local, requires user interaction, and has no impact on data integrity or availability.
