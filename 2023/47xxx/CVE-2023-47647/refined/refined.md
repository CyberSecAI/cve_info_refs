The provided content is related to CVE-2023-47647.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the BadgeOS WordPress plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privilege roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The plugin lacks proper access control mechanisms, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) can perform actions that are meant for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies, but it could lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other unauthorized activities.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the WordPress web interface through a vulnerable function that does not validate user permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with subscriber privileges on the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
