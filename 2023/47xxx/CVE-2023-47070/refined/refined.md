Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47070:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is classified as an out-of-bounds write, meaning that the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This implies an attacker could potentially gain full control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is described as local (AV:L), meaning that an attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required, indicating that a user needs to perform some action (e.g., open a malicious file) for the attack to succeed.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning that the exploit is relatively easy to achieve.
- No privileges are required (PR:N), an attacker does not need any special permissions to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have local access to the affected machine.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into performing some action that triggers the vulnerability in After Effects. This might involve opening a specially crafted file.

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (Critical)

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Affected Software:** Adobe After Effects versions 24.0.2 and earlier, and versions 23.6 and earlier.

**Fix:** Update to version 24.0.3 or 23.6.2
