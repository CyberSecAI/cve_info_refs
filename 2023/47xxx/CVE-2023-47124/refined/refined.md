* This information confirms that the provided content relates to CVE-2023-47124.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Traefik manages the ACME HTTP challenge. Specifically, the authorized delay to solve the challenge (50 seconds) can be abused by attackers using a slowloris attack. The default implementation retries the http challenge with a backoff, and this is exploitable.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the ACME HTTP challenge process to slowloris attacks due to the retry backoff mechanism. This allows attackers to keep connections open and exhaust server resources while the challenge is pending.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS), potentially making the Traefik instance and the services it proxies unavailable.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends slowloris requests to the ACME HTTP challenge endpoint.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Traefik instance. No specific privileges or user interaction is needed.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Traefik v2: <= v2.10.5
    *   Traefik v3: <= v3.0.0-beta4

*   **Patched Versions:**
    *   Traefik v2: v2.10.6
    *   Traefik v3: v3.0.0-beta5

*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Use the `TLSChallenge` or `DNSChallenge` instead of `HTTPChallenge` for ACME certificate generation.

*   **Mitigation:**
    * Upgrade to the patched versions.

*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.9.

* **CWEs:**
    * CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion)
    * CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime)

* The fix implemented by PR #10224 removes the backoff from the HTTP challenge to avoid the attack vector, since the `Present` method is synchronous.

**Summary**
CVE-2023-47124 describes a vulnerability in Traefik's ACME HTTP challenge implementation. The retry backoff makes the challenge susceptible to slowloris attacks that could lead to a denial of service. The vulnerability affects versions v2.10.5 and below, and v3.0.0-beta4 and below. It is resolved in v2.10.6 and v3.0.0-beta5. Users should either upgrade their Traefik instances or use TLS or DNS challenges as a workaround.
