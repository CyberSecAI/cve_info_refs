## CVE-2023-47314 – Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 – XSS via Uncontrolled File Upload

Published CVE numbers:

* <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47314>
* <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47314>

Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

The file upload function allows APK and arbitrary files to be uploaded. By exploiting this issue, attackers may upload HTML files and share the download URL pointing to these files with the victims. As the file download function returns the file in inline mode, the victim’s browser will immediately render the content of the HTML file as a web page. As a result, the uploaded client-side code will be evaluated and executed in the victim’s browser, allowing attackers to perform common XSS attacks.

### Exploitation’s steps

Authentication: Required (a low-level access is enough)

* Due to the vulnerability CVE-2023-47316, even low-level users can access the tab *Files*
* Uploading an HTML file with arbitrary content by using the add file function under the tab *Files*

Uploading an HTML file

* Intercepting/modifying the outgoing HTTP requests is not necessary
* The uploaded file can be downloaded by using the following URL: [https://{server-address}/files/{original-name-of-the-uploaded-file}](https://%7Bserver-address%7D/files/%7Boriginal-name-of-the-uploaded-file%7D)

HTML file can be rendered

​

* The above URL is accessible even for unauthenticated users
