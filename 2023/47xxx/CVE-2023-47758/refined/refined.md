- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Multi Step Form Plugin lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website that makes the malicious request on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress plugin into triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to target an authenticated user.
