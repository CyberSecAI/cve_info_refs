- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker can overflow the cookie threshold.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The IPSEC daemon has a limited cookie threshold, which can be exceeded by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This leads to a denial of service, making it impossible to establish IPSEC connections.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction. The attack can be performed remotely.
