Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-47065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before storing it, leading to Stored XSS. Specifically, there is a lack of proper output encoding or escaping of user-controlled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered via network access (AV:N). An attacker could insert malicious code into the application's database or storage. When a user views this data, the malicious script executes in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user (PR:L) with the ability to inject the malicious code, however a successful attack requires user interaction (UI:R) from the victim.

**Additional Notes**
* The CVSS vector string is "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
* The vulnerability is rated as "Important" severity with a base score of 5.4.
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
