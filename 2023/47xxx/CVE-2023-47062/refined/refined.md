- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could lead to a memory leak in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are required (PR:N). User interaction is required (UI:R).
