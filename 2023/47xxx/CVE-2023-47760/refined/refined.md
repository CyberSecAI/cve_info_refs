Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue in the Essential Blocks for Gutenberg plugin. Specifically, there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically, a "Subscriber" role in WordPress) could perform actions they are not intended to have access to. The specific impact varies depending on the context, but could lead to unauthorized modification of data or other impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting a function that lacks proper access control checks. The specific function is not named in the description.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with a "Subscriber" role or lower.
