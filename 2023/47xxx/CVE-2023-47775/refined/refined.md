- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF protection allows attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the application, using their existing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor crafts a request that appears to be from a legitimate user and tricks the user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they must be able to get a user to interact with the crafted request.
