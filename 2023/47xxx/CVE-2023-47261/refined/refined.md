Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47261:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive database connection strings within the application's response to the `/#/gettingstarted` endpoint. Specifically, the response contains connection strings for a privileged SQL Server database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The application improperly exposes database connection strings, including credentials, in the response to a specific endpoint. This allows unauthorized access to the database.
2.  **Lack of Proper Authorization/License Validation:** The application can be bypassed using a backslash character `\` or by manipulating the response. This suggests a lack of robust license validation.
3. **Exposed MSSQL service port:** The MSSQL server is exposed and accessible to the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to:

1.  **Gain Unauthorized Database Access:** Using the exposed credentials, the attacker can connect to the SQL Server database.
2.  **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By enabling `xp_cmdshell` within the SQL Server, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Forced Browsing:** The attacker navigates to the `/#/gettingstarted` endpoint, which is not directly linked to from the login page, but can be found via the browser history after interacting with the setup button on the login page.
2.  **License Bypass:** The attacker bypasses the license validation by using a backslash `\` character as the license value or by manipulating the server response.
3.  **Credential Harvesting:** The attacker intercepts the response from the `/#/gettingstarted` endpoint to obtain the database connection strings.
4.  **MSSQL Exploitation:** The attacker connects to the exposed MSSQL service using the retrieved credentials and uses `xp_cmdshell` to achieve RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Dokmee ECM server.
2.  **Browser/HTTP Client:** The attacker needs a browser or HTTP client (like Burp Suite) to navigate to the endpoint and intercept responses.
3.  **SQL Server Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL Server and how to use tools like Metasploit, Crackmapexec, or SQL Server Management Studio.
