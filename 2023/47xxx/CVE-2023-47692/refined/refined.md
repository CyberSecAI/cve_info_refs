- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the absence of proper checks on user permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is within the WordPress Flo Forms plugin. An attacker would need to find a specific function where access control is missing or broken.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least "subscriber" level privileges.
