{
  "CVE-2023-47633": {
    "Description": "The traefik docker container uses 100% CPU when it serves as its own backend, which is an automatically generated route resulting from the Docker integration in the default configuration. When using `stripPrefix` and `retry` middleware, retries were sent with the original, not the stripped URL.",
    "Root cause": "An automatically generated route resulting from the Docker integration in the default configuration can create a loop by targeting itself. Also, when using `stripPrefix` and `retry` middleware, retries were sent with the original, not the stripped URL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400",
      "CWE-770",
      "Recursive requests leading to infinite loop"
    ],
    "Impact": "Server is unreachable and uses 100% CPU. Retries were sent with the original, not the stripped URL.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to know the name of the docker container when the docker backend is used or send a request with a specific hostname (e.g., traefik-service)."
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs because of the default rule mechanism and the exposure of the Traefik container, which can create a router targeting itself.  The vulnerability is triggered when Traefik serves as its own backend. The fix introduces an internal middleware to refuse the request if already been passed by the same router. Also, a deep copy of the request was needed because the `stripPrefix` middleware also mutates the request headers."
