- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 10WebAnalytics WordPress plugin <= 1.2.12 has a broken access control vulnerability. This means that there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, can execute actions that should be limited to higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by users with low privileges (e.g., subscriber) by directly accessing a function that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, specifically a subscriber.
