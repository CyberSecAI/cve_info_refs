*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed but, generally, broken access control can lead to unauthorized data modification, access to sensitive information, or execution of privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting the function that lacks proper access controls. An attacker would need to send a request to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber," implying they have a low level of privilege within the WordPress system. They would need to be an authenticated user.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" priority and CVSS score of 5.4.
*   The vulnerable versions are <= 2.3.0, and the fix is available in version 2.3.1.
