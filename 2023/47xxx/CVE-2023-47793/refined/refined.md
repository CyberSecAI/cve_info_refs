- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, which allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact can vary depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious requests to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be a subscriber, which is the lowest privilege level in WordPress.
