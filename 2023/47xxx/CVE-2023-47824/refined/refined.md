- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Legal Pages WordPress plugin versions 1.3.8 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unintended actions within the WordPress site. The specific impact will vary based on the actions the plugin allows, but could lead to unauthorized modifications, content changes, or other administrative tasks being performed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious link or embedding a form in a website, email or other channel controlled by the attacker. When a logged-in administrator/user clicks the link or form, the malicious request is sent to the vulnerable WordPress plugin, potentially executing unwanted actions in the context of the authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in administrator or user of the affected WordPress site to click a malicious link or submit a malicious form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
