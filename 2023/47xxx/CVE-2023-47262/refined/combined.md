# PRODUCT SECURITY BULLETIN: **ID NOW INSTRUMENT CVE-2023-47262**

**Publication Date: 11/14/23

Last Updated: 11/14/23**

As part of Abbott’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program, a third-party researcher recently identified a physical vulnerability in the ID NOWTM Instrument. Abbott has self-reported this vulnerability (CVE-2023-47262).

If exploited, the vulnerability could allow device settings to be modified and/or interrupt the instrument startup process. The ability to exploit this vulnerability is limited, as it would require a direct physical intrusion into the instrument and would require the user to gain access to and tamper with an internal port or memory.

Abbott has reviewed the level of potential impact of this vulnerability on product performance and safety, and has taken appropriate steps to mitigate this issue in its latest software update, v7.1.

**Affected Products**

| **Product** | **Status** | **Remediation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ID NOWTM Instrument | No known exploits of this physical vulnerability in ID NOW Instruments have occurred to date. The ability to exploit the vulnerability is limited due to the need for physical access to the ID NOW Instrument and internal serial port and memory.  Additionally, the presence of tamper-evident seals on the ID NOW Instrument may be used to indicate any prior physical intrusion into the device. | Customers should inspect tamper-evident seals found on the ID NOW Instrument to indicate any prior physical intrusion. Contact assigned account representative for assistance as needed.  Customers should also physically secure the ID NOW Instrument and its operating environment in accordance with operational guidance found in the User Manual. This includes considering implementation of policies to control and monitor physical access to the instrument and inspecting tamper-evident seals on a periodic basis.  Abbott has provided a mitigation for this vulnerability in the latest software release, v7.1. |
