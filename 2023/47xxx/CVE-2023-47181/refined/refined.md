- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, information theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to inject the malicious script, which likely involves exploiting an input field or some other mechanism where user input is not properly sanitized or encoded. The attacker needs administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
