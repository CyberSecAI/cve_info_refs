- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Canada Post Shipping Plugin <= 2.8.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, allowing attackers to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), where a malicious actor crafts a request that a legitimate, authenticated user unknowingly executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to induce a higher privileged user to unknowingly trigger a crafted request (e.g., through a malicious link). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.
