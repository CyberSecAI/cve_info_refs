**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Ajax Domain Checker plugin, in versions 1.3.0 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website.
- These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, specifically via a mechanism that allows user-supplied data to be output without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts via the plugin's vulnerable input mechanism.
-  The required privilege for exploitation is identified as "Contributor," suggesting that an authenticated user with the "Contributor" role is able to inject the payload.
