- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to a Broken Access Control issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute a higher privileged action.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an unprivileged user (Subscriber role) to execute actions they are not supposed to, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of data.
- **Attack vectors**:  The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is related to functions within the plugin that lack proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have at least a subscriber role on the WordPress site.
