Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `TopicEmbed` feature not properly handling redirects when making requests to fetch remote content for embedding. This lack of proper redirect handling allows an attacker to potentially force the server to make requests to internal or unintended external resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is SSRF, where the server can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Limited. An attacker could potentially access information from internal resources that should not be exposed. The CVSS score indicates low confidentiality impact.
- **Integrity:** None. The attacker cannot modify data.
- **Availability:** None. The attacker cannot disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network, and does not require local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** Some form of user interaction is required to trigger the embedding feature.
- **High Attack Complexity:** The attack is not straightforward, and requires some effort and understanding of how the embedding feature operates to craft an exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves blocking redirects when making the final request in `TopicEmbed`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Discourse prior to stable 3.1.3, and beta/tests-passed 3.2.0.beta3.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity (3.4 CVSS score).
- A workaround is to disable the embedding feature.
- The vulnerability is addressed in commits `24cca10da731734af4e9748de99a508d586e59f1` and `5f20748e402223b265e6fee381472c14e2604da6`.
