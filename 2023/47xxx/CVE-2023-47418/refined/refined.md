{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The O2OA system allows the creation of new interfaces within its service management function. These interfaces can execute JavaScript scripts, which can be used to bypass blacklisted Java classes and call dangerous classes, ultimately leading to command execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the O2OA system. This, combined with the ability to bypass blacklisted Java classes, allows for the execution of dangerous commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server running the O2OA system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves creating a new interface in the O2OA service management function, then using that interface to execute malicious JavaScript code.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the service management function of O2OA to create new interfaces, and then to execute javascript scripts through it."
