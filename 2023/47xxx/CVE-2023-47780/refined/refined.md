- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EasyAzon WordPress plugin, in versions 5.1.0 and earlier, suffers from a broken access control vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function allows unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The specific impact will vary depending on the function lacking access control. However, in general, it allows unprivileged users to perform actions that they should not be authorized to do.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit the broken access control by triggering the vulnerable function without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with subscriber privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability.
