Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "broken access control issue", which stems from missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if a user is authorized to perform a specific action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as potentially "highly dangerous" and expected to become mass exploited
*  The specific impact is not detailed but could lead to unauthorized modification of data, access to sensitive information or complete takeover of the site

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a function with missing authorization checks.
* The specific vulnerable function is not mentioned

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in EazyDocs plugin versions <= 2.3.5 and is fixed in version 2.3.6.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A5: Broken Access Control.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
