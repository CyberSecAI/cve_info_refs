{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SSRF validation in Label Studio only checks the IP address resolved during the initial DNS lookup and doesn't validate the final destination IP address after redirects or DNS rebinding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass SSRF protections to access internal web servers, potentially compromising the confidentiality of those internal servers. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or internal cloud APIs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP redirection: The attacker uses a URL that redirects to an internal server.",
      "DNS rebinding: The attacker uses a domain name that initially resolves to a safe IP address, but later resolves to an internal IP address when the request is actually made."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the URL used to import tasks into Label Studio and have a method to redirect traffic to an internal resource or have the ability to setup a DNS rebinding attack."
