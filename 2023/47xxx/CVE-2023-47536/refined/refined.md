Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper access control issue (CWE-284) related to the handling of GeoIP database updates in FortiOS and FortiProxy. Specifically, it is caused by the time gap between a GeoIP database update and the enforcement of a deny policy based on geolocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control leading to a firewall policy bypass.
- The system is vulnerable during the update of the GeoIP database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can bypass the firewall's deny geolocation policy. This means that an attacker from a blocked geographic location may be able to access resources or services that should be restricted.
- The impact is considered "low" severity, with potential for a limited integrity impact (I:L).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access.
- The attacker has to time their actions in order to occur during the GeoIP database update.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated
- The attacker needs to be able to send traffic that would normally be denied by a geolocation-based firewall rule
- The attacker needs to be able to time the bypass with a GeoIP database update

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the timing of the GeoIP database update process.
- The issue affects multiple versions of FortiOS and FortiProxy.
- FortiOS versions 7.4 and FortiProxy 7.4 are not affected.
- Specific affected versions and the corresponding fixes are listed.
- A CVSSv3 score of 2.8 is provided (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:R)
