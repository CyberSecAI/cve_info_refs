{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation when editing package download locations in pyLoad's web interface. While package creation sanitizes the directory name, package editing does not, allowing users to specify arbitrary paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can gain control over the underlying pyLoad server by downloading malicious scripts to arbitrary locations and executing them via pyLoad's script processing functionality, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface",
      "Package editing functionality"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the pyLoad web interface with the ability to create and edit packages. They also need the ability to host a malicious script on a server accessible to the pyLoad instance."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "steps_to_reproduce": [
      "Login to a pyLoad instance.",
      "Create a new package with any name and a valid link.",
       "Click 'Edit Package' on the newly created package and set the folder as '/config/scripts/download_finished/'.",
      "Restart the package.",
       "Check the server filesystem and note the link was downloaded and stored inside '/config/scripts/download_finished/'."
    ],
      "rce_poc": [
        "Attacker starts a web server hosting a malicious script.",
         "Attacker starts netcat listener for reverse shells.",
          "Attacker Changes pyLoad file permission settings to allow execution.",
           "Attacker creates a package with link pointing to the malicious script.",
            "Attacker Edits the package and changes the folder to '/config/scripts/package_deleted/'",
