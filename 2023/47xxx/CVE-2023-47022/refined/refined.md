Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The application does not properly validate user authorization when accessing audit logs. This allows an unprivileged user to directly reference and manipulate audit logs of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Log Manipulation:** An attacker can edit audit logs for any user.
*   **CSV Injection:** The ability to edit audit logs can lead to CSV injection vulnerabilities, which can be exploited when the manipulated logs are exported or opened with CSV reading applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user who has access to the application. The user directly manipulates the reference to audit logs of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to have an account with access to the NCR Terminal Handler v.1.5.1 application to manipulate the logs using IDOR. No special privileges are needed, only a valid user account.

**Additional Details:**

* The affected product is NCR Terminal Handler v.1.5.1.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Patrick Nassef aka (30T4).
* A link to the CVE entry on MITRE is provided.
