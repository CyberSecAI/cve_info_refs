- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "CodeBard's Patron Button and Widgets for Patreon" versions <= 2.1.9 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a higher privileged user to perform unintended actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through a CSRF attack. An unauthenticated attacker could potentially trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions they did not intend to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
