Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure construction of filters for task queries in Label Studio. Specifically, the application allows users to specify filters using Django's ORM without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to craft filter chains that traverse database relationships and expose sensitive fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **ORM Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an ORM Leak, where an attacker can use specially crafted filter expressions to access and exfiltrate sensitive data by leveraging Django's ORM capabilities. The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the filter values, allowing the attacker to construct filter chains that access related models and fields (e.g., accessing `updated_by__active_organization__active_users__password`).
- **Insecure Filter Construction:** The application constructs database filters directly from user input without validation against an allowlist.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization**: User-supplied data for filtering is not properly sanitized.
- **Hardcoded Secret Key (<= 1.8.1):** Older versions of Label Studio had a hardcoded secret key, which, when combined with the ORM Leak, allowed attackers to forge session tokens for any user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can leak highly sensitive information, including password hashes, of all user accounts.
- **Account Compromise:** By leaking password hashes and potentially forging session tokens, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and perform malicious actions.
- **Integrity and Availability Risks:** While the primary impact is confidentiality, the ability to forge session tokens could also lead to data manipulation (integrity) or denial-of-service attacks (availability).
- **Complete System Compromise:** Chaining the ORM leak vulnerability with the hardcoded secret key in older versions could allow complete compromise of the Label Studio instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **API Endpoint:** The attack vector is through the `/api/dm/views/{viewId}` endpoint by sending a specially crafted JSON payload to create or modify view filters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Label Studio instance.
- **Authentication:** While the attacker doesn't need specific privileges, they must be an authenticated user on the platform to create or edit views and corresponding filters.
- **Knowledge of ORM:** The attacker must understand how Django ORM relationships and filters work to create malicious filter chains.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker should be able to make HTTP requests to the Label Studio API.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) script written in Python that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability to leak password hashes character by character.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Alex Brown (elttam) in August 2023.
- The fix involves allowlisting allowed fields and preventing the use of user-provided values when constructing filters.
