- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could perform actions that require higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:  The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided text, however it involves a function lacking proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with "Subscriber" privileges is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
