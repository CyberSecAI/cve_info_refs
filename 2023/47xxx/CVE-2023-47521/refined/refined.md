- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Q2W3 Post Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts would then be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields or parameters. The specific attack vector is not described in detail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
