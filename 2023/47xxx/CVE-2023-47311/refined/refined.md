      "status": "Relevant",
      "details": "Root cause of vulnerability: The application lacks proper protection against clickjacking.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker can create a website that encourages a user to perform specific actions (e.g., click on a button) thinking they are interacting with an unrelated website, while unknowingly performing actions on the vulnerable application. This can lead to the user unknowingly sending commands, modifying settings, or performing other sensitive actions.\nAttack vectors: An attacker creates a malicious website with a hidden iframe loading the vulnerable application and overlays it with a div tag containing elements that the user is tricked into interacting with.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and trick the user into visiting the site while the user is logged into the vulnerable application."
