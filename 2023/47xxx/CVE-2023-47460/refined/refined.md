Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-47460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Knovos Discovery application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This type of vulnerability arises when user-controllable input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability also allows for potential information disclosure, implying that attackers could access sensitive data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specific HTTP POST request to the `/DiscoveryProcess/Service/Admin.svc/getGridColumnStructure` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authorized User:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the application to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates that an attacker must have valid credentials and privileges within the Knovos Discovery platform.
-   **Manipulation of Input Parameters:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by inserting malicious SQL code into the "gridName" parameter within the request body.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating the exploit:
```
POST /DiscoveryProcess/Service/Admin.svc/getGridColumnStructure?caseMappingId=*** HTTP/1.1
Host: vuln_host
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/117.0
Content-Type: application/json
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 73
Connection: close

{
  "gridName":"Inventory-grid' waitfor delay'0:0:50'--",
  "uID":"10"
}
```
- The "gridName" parameter is injected with `' waitfor delay'0:0:50'--` which serves as the malicious SQL payload. The `waitfor delay` statement is used here as an indicator of successful injection, causing a 50-second delay in the response if the injection works. This could potentially be any SQL command for more impactful attacks (e.g. data retrieval, data manipulation, or code execution via database functions or operating system calls).

**Affected Component:**
 - The vulnerable component is the `/DiscoveryProcess/Service/Admin.svc/getGridColumnStructure` endpoint.

**Affected Product Version:**
-   Knovos Discovery version 22.67.0 is affected.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The content also highlights the importance of proper input sanitization and parameterized queries in software development to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities.
-   The discoverer of the vulnerability is identified as Aleksey Vistorobskiy.

This detailed breakdown captures the essential aspects of CVE-2023-47460 as described in the provided content.
