Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Mercedes me iOS app where booking maintenance orders can be accessed without proper authorization. The app allows users to check other orders by traversing odd numbers, indicating an insecure implementation of order ID handling or a lack of proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The app uses predictable or sequential identifiers (odd numbers) to access order details, making it possible to iterate through and access other users' orders without authorization.
*   **Lack of Proper Authorization:** The application fails to verify whether the user is authorized to access the specific order information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker can access sensitive information belonging to other users, including:
    *   4S shop details
    *   Owner's phone number
    *   Owner's name
    *   Vehicle model
    *   Date of the order/service
    *   Potentially other order-related information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the app's API requests to traverse odd numbers in the order ID parameter, thereby accessing unauthorized order information.
*   **Malicious app manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or create a malicious version of the app to perform the attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Mercedes me iOS App:** The attacker needs to have the affected version of the Mercedes me iOS app installed.
*   **Understanding of API structure/traffic:** The attacker needs to understand the API requests the app makes to fetch order details and be able to manipulate the requests.
*   **Basic App Interaction:** The attacker must be able to use a device running an affected version of the app and have an active network connection.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** The vulnerability affects the Mercedes me iOS app version 1.34.0 and potentially earlier versions.
*   **Testing Environment:** The vulnerability was tested using an iPhone 13 Pro with iOS 16.6.1 and Yakit 1.2.7, which is not necessarily relevant to the vulnerability itself but confirms the exploitability.
*   **Description:** The vulnerability allows to check other orders by traversing odd numbers. This indicates that the backend is likely not implementing proper authorization checks, but instead uses a predictable or sequential order ID scheme which allows other userâ€™s booking maintenance orders to be viewed.
