* Only users with a valid AMS (Annual Maintenance and Support) contract are eligible to download Service packs and other upgrades. Refer <https://www.manageengine.com/support.html> for more details.
* Applications Manager plugin, if present, should be upgraded to version 14540 or above before upgrading OpManager from version 12.5 to 12.5.100 and higher versions.
### Steps to apply the service pack to OpManager

* Standard/Professional Edition
  1. Shut down OpManager. (If OpManager is running as a Windows service, stop the service from Control Panel > Services window and close the window.)
  2. Start the Command Prompt as an administrator: Search for “cmd”, right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. (Click here to see the screenshot)
  3. Back up the database (follow the steps [here](https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/help/data-backup-and-restoration.html)).
  4. End the processes: Open the Task Manager and make sure the processes java.exe or wrapper.exe of the application are terminated.
  5. Back up the application folder: Make a copy of the  folder. This will back up the product configuration settings.
  6. Launch Update Manager:
     + **Windows OS:** Go to the /bin folder and run the script UpdateManager.bat
     + **Linux OS:** Go to the /bin folder and run the script UpdateManager.sh
  7. Click the Browse button to select the upgrade pack file (the .ppm file that you downloaded) and choose Install.
  8. Follow the on-screen instructions to apply the service pack.
  9. Once the upgrade is complete, start the service for the changes to take effect.
* Enterprise Edition

  **Step 1: OpManager Database Backup**

  1. Stop the OpManager Central and all probe services.
  2. Backup the OpManager database in one of the following methods:
     1. **If the backend database is installed on an MSSQL server**, take an SQL backup of OpManager database and all the dependent plug-in databases.
     2. **If OpManager is installed on a Windows machine**, go to the bin > backup folder under OpManager installation directory and execute the BackupDB.bat as administrator for the Central server and all probe servers.
     3. **If OpManager is installed on a Linux machine**, go to the bin > backup folder under OpManager installation directory and execute the BackupDB.sh as root user for the Central server and all probe servers.
     4. **If OpManager is installed on a virtual machine**, take a VM snapshot of the Central and all probes.

  **Step 2: updating the Central Server**

  1. Start all Probe services for Smart Update to take effect.
  2. Go to the bin folder under OpManagerCentral installation directory.
     1. ***Windows OS***: Run the *UpdateManager.bat* file as administrator.
     2. ***Linux OS:*** Run the *UpdateManager.sh* file as root user.
  3. The Update Manager launcher appears on the screen.
  4. Browse the required Update Pack file and click on **Install**.
  5. Follow the on-screen instructions to apply the Update Pack.
  6. Once the update is complete, start the OpManagerCentral Service for the update to take effect.

  **Step 3: Smart Update (Automatic updating of Probe servers)**

  1. The Probe will automatically contact the Central server.
  2. Once the Probe server detects a build number mismatch with the Central server, all the Probe services will be stopped.
  3. The Probe server downloads the Update Pack from the Central server and starts updating.
  4. Once the update process is complete, restart all Probe services.

Remember, if you are applying more than one update pack, you have to follow the instructions above for each update pack. For instance, if you are on build 124196 and have to move to 125203, here's how you should go about it:

* Follow the steps (coressponding to your OpManager Edition) to update to build 125010.
* Ensure you start OpManager after this update.
* Again stop OpManager and follow the update steps (coressponding to your OpManager Edition) to move to build 125203.
### How can I find the build number of OpManager?

1. In the Web Client, click on the "Administrator" icon in the top right corner of the page.
2. Search for the 'Build Number' among the product details listed.
3. Check the following image guide to locate the build number.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1851

## ManageEngine OpManager uploadMib directory traversal vulnerability

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-47211

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the uploadMib functionality of ManageEngine OpManager 12.7.258. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file creation. An attacker can send a malicious MiB file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

ManageEngine OpManager 12.7.258

##### PRODUCT URLS

OpManager - <https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

OpManager is a network management solution that gathers hardware and software information of computers and other devices on a computer network for management, compliance and audit purposes.

An exploitable directory traversal vulnerability exists in relation to `MiB` file upload action. Specifically, when navigating to `Settings -> Tools -> MiB Browser` and selecting `Upload MiB`, the following API call is performed:

```
POST /client/api/json/mibbrowser/uploadMib HTTP/1.1

```

Using this API, an attacker is able to send a malicious MiB file to the server. Looking at vulnerable code:

Line 1539                        File destFile = new File(mibFileLoc + File.separator + orgMibName + fextension);
Line 1540                        if (destFile.exists()) {
Line 1541                            toReturn.put("error", NmsUtil.GetString("webclient.tools.mibbrowser.file.exists"));
Line 1542                            importedFile.delete();
Line 1543                        } else {
Line 1544                            CommonUtil.copyFile(importedFile, destFile, 10000);
Line 1545

```

As we can see in `line 1503` `orgMibName` variable is set based on a part of the uploaded MiB file content, which in our case equals `../malicious_file`.
Tracking down usage of this variable, we can see that it is used as a part of destination file name/path `line 1539`.
Following `orgMibName` variable from the initialization to its usage at `line 1539`, we dont see any sanitization checks in a context of directory traversal.
That gives an attacker the possibility to create file in any location outside `mibs` ( default MiBs files location) directory.
The only constraint an attacker needs to deal with is file extension, which needs to be set to one of those checked at `line 1495`.

**Details:**

Previously, path traversal vulnerability was detected for MIB browser.

This issue has now been fixed by implementing path sanitization, ensuring a new MIB is stored exclusively under the "OpManager/mibs" directory.

**Impact:**

The identified vulnerability enables authenticated users who have access to MIB Browser functionality to manipulate the file path or location of the uploaded MIB files outside the intended product installation directory using the Upload MIB feature in the MIB Browser tool via Upload MIB API.

**Steps to upgrade:**

1. Kindly download the latest upgrade pack from [here](https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/service-packs.html?CVE-2023-47211).
2. Apply the latest build to your existing product installation as per the upgrade pack instructions provided in the above step.
