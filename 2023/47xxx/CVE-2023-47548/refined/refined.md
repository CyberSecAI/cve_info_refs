- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirection. The plugin is vulnerable because it doesn't properly sanitize or validate the redirect URL, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious site, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to a site controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
