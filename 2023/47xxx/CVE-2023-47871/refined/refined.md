Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the "Contact Form to Any API" WordPress plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly control access to certain functionalities within the plugin, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, could potentially perform actions intended for higher-level users (e.g., administrator). This could lead to various impacts depending on the specific actions the user can access, like data modification, or more severe security compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is able to interact with the plugin's functions that lack proper access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a basic user role (e.g., subscriber) on the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed. No other special access or capabilities are explicitly required as described in this content.
