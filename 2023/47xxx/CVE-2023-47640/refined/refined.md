Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The DataHub Frontend was using a SHA-1 HMAC with the frontend secret key for signing session cookies. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically weak, and the use of a shorter-than-recommended key length for the signing key makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks. This was due to the default settings of the Play LegacyCookiesModule.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Weak Cryptographic Algorithm:** Usage of SHA-1 HMAC for session signing.
*   **Insufficient Key Length:** The signing key was shorter than recommended, making brute-force attacks more feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could crack the signing key for DataHub.
*   The attacker could then generate a privileged session cookie, potentially gaining escalated privileges.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks
*   The attacker needs to have a valid session token, which can be obtained by:
    *   Successful authentication by the attacker
    *   Acquiring a valid session cookie through other means from another logged-in user

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to obtain a session token.
*   Sufficient computational resources (e.g., "a few hundred thousand dollars worth of compute resources") to perform brute-force attacks.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerability to exploit it by crafting a new session cookie with the cracked signing key.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects deployments using the default helm chart configurations.
*   The issue is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.

* CVSS v3 base metrics:
    *   Attack vector: Network
