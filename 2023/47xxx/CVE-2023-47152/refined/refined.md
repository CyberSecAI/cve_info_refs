Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-47152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure cryptographic algorithm used within IBM Db2.
*   Additionally, under exceptional conditions, the vulnerability could lead to information disclosure through stack traces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm:** The use of a weak cryptographic algorithm within IBM Db2 creates a vulnerability that can be exploited.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The potential to expose sensitive information via stack traces when exceptional conditions occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the stack trace exposure.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although this is listed as a potential impact in the NetApp advisory, the IBM advisory doesn't specify DoS as an impact of CVE-2023-47152 directly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   Exploitation does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) for the cryptographic vulnerability.
*   However, the information disclosure via stack trace vulnerability could potentially require some level of access to trigger the exceptional condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Db2 version 11.5.x, specifically the client component.
*   The IBM bulletin provides specific links for downloading interim fixes for various platforms.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates the vulnerability is also present in products that utilize IBM DB2 but states that no NetApp products are affected by this specific CVE.
*   The severity score is rated as 7.5 (HIGH) by both IBM and NetApp, although the specific CVSS vector is slightly different. The NetApp advisory has the impact as C:H, while the IBM bulletin implies that impact is either C:H or I:H based on the description.
*   IBM does not disclose exact functionality or steps to exploit a vulnerability in an attempt to prevent attackers from crafting exploits.

In summary, CVE-2023-47152 involves an insecure cryptographic algorithm and potential information disclosure through stack traces in IBM Db2. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring user interaction.
