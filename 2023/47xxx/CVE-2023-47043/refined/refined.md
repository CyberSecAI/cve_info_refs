- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, and requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access and requires the user to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.
