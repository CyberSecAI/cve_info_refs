{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "The `owner` and `pkg` parameters from the request are reflected in the response when the endpoint is not found, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially achieve Remote Code Execution by injecting malicious JavaScript that can make authenticated requests to the server.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a URL with malicious values for the `owner` and `pkg` parameters, and then tricking a user into clicking the link.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it."
  },
    "vulnerability_2": {
    "root_cause": "The `redirect_uri` parameter on the login page is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Specifically, the application uses the value of the `redirect_uri` parameter without proper sanitization within the client side logic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
   "impact": "An attacker can potentially achieve Remote Code Execution by injecting malicious JavaScript code using the javascript scheme within the redirect URI, which will be executed after successful login.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a URL with a malicious `redirect_uri` parameter that contains javascript code.",
