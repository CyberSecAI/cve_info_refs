- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Big File Uploads WordPress plugin versions <= 2.1.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, which allows attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts may vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in user visits a malicious website or opens a malicious link. This request will be sent to the vulnerable website on behalf of the authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering the malicious request (e.g. by visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
