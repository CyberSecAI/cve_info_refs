Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Broken Access Control

**Root Cause:** The LuckyWP Scripts Control plugin (versions <= 1.2.1) lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin doesn't properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The plugin might not be properly authenticating the user before allowing them to access certain features.
*   **Missing Nonce Token Checks:** The plugin may not be using nonce tokens to prevent CSRF attacks, which could be related to the Broken Access Control.

**Impact:**
*   An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "subscriber" in the details) could potentially perform actions that should only be allowed for higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary depending on the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the vulnerable function. The specific method isn't detailed in this writeup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user of the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to have a "subscriber" level account (or potentially other low-privilege roles).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Abdi Pranata.
*   A patch is available in version 1.2.2 of the plugin.
*   Patchstack provides a virtual patch as a temporary mitigation.
