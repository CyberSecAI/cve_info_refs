- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow in the T64 codec decompression logic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow when decompressing data using the T64 codec.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A specially crafted payload can crash the ClickHouse server process.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Native interface (port 9000/tcp) without authentication.
    - HTTP protocol with valid credentials (authentication takes place first)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the ClickHouse server.
    - Ability to send a specially crafted payload to the server. For the native interface no authentication is needed, while for HTTP, valid credentials are required.
