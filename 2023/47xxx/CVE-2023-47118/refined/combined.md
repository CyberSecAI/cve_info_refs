## Description

### Impact

A heap buffer overflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send a specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default on port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codec that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require authentication.

Note that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTP protocol, however, the attacker will need a valid credential as the HTTP authentication take places first.

### Patches

Fix has been pushed to version v23.10.2.13-stable, v23.9.4.11-stable, v23.8.6.16-lts, v23.3.16.7-lts

### Workarounds

Affected users are advised to block native port access and temporary switch to HTTP protocol to reduce the exposure before they can upgrade to supported versions.

### Backport

If you are maintaining your own forked version of ClickHouse. The fix for this vulnerability can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56434).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
