Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47624:

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-47624 is related to an arbitrary file read vulnerability found in `HlsRouter.js` of the Audiobookshelf application. This vulnerability allows any user, regardless of their permissions, to read files from the local file system using a path traversal attack via the `/hls` endpoint.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `req.params.file` parameter in the `HlsRouter.js` file. The application directly concatenates user-provided input with the base path, allowing for directory traversal using `..%2F` sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not sanitize the file path provided in the request, allowing attackers to traverse directories and access arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the provided file path.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** This vulnerability can be exploited by any user, regardless of their assigned permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read any file on the server's file system that the application has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, application source code, user data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through the `/hls` endpoint.
*   Attackers send a GET request to this endpoint, providing a malicious `file` parameter that uses `..%2F` sequences to traverse directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
*   No specific user permissions are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details (from provided content):**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is in `HlsRouter.js`:

```javascript
var streamId = req.params.stream
var fullFilePath = Path.join(this.playbackSessionManager.StreamsPath, streamId, req.params.file)
var exists = await fs.pathExists(fullFilePath)
res.sendFile(fullFilePath)
```

*   The `req.params.file` is directly concatenated with the `this.playbackSessionManager.StreamsPath` and streamId.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable with a request like this:
    `http://localhost:3333/hls/whatever/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F(url encoded full path here)`
