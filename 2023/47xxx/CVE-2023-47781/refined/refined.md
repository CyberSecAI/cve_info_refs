- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Thrive Theme Builder theme for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could result in unauthorized modifications or actions within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by tricking a logged-in user into performing an action they did not intend. This is typically achieved by sending a crafted link or embedding malicious code on a website that is visited by the user while they are logged in to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests and needs a user with higher privileges to be logged in to the affected WordPress site, and to be tricked into clicking a link or visiting a website hosting the attack. The attacker is not required to be authenticated on the affected system.
