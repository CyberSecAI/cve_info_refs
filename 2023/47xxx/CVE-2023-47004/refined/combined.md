### **[AshitakaAkasaka](/AshitakaAkasaka)** commented [Sep 7, 2023](#issue-1885041045)

| Summary I have found a security vulnerability in the latest codebase of RedisGraph. With personal investigation, I think an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to archive a **remote code execution** on a vulnerable Redis instance. The vulnerability exists in code logic after a valid authentication. PoC Here is a screenshot for a local lab environment to demostrate remote code execution [73FA3C08-BA4F-46DC-BBA2-36A2240253A1](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/11502905/266192168-073065bd-9695-40be-9701-c0ec45aef7b8.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.XcxWdE10T08KRqYMDZlSiqSy5moLErLZznr6oxI21nc)  we have a full screen record for the whole process but it is too big to attach to a github issue Step To Reproduce Since this vulnerability leads to a remote code execution attack vector, it is better not to put the PoC in a public visitable GitHub issue. Please let me know a perfer way to report this vulnerability to the dev team. |
