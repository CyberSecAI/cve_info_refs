Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-47458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of a proper permissions control framework and insufficient user permission control within the SpringBlade application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is an incorrect implementation of access controls, which leads to privilege escalation.
- **Insufficient User Permission Control:** The system does not adequately manage and enforce user permissions, allowing for unauthorized access to functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain higher-level privileges within the application than they are supposed to have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Direct Route Construction:** Attackers can exploit the privilege escalation features by directly constructing routes or requests to access unauthorized functionalities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have remote network access to the SpringBlade application.
- **Basic Understanding of Application Functionality:** Attackers must have some knowledge about the application's structure and how to construct specific requests to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects SpringBlade versions up to and including 3.7.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mr-F0reigner.

In summary, the core issue is a flaw in access control that allows a remote attacker to escalate their privileges by directly accessing restricted functionalities due to a lack of adequate permission enforcement.
