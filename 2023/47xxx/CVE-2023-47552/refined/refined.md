- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Image Hover Effects plugin (<= 5.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, leading to unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and needs a logged-in user to interact with it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress instance.
