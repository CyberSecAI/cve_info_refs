- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions. Specific impacts vary but can lead to significant security issues.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by bypassing access controls through a function lacking proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with subscriber-level privileges can exploit the vulnerability.
