- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the user to open a malicious file or perform a malicious action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted file or perform a specific action on the software. The attacker needs no special privileges or account. User interaction is required.
