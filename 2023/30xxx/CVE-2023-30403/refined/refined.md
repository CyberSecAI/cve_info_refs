Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in the Aigital WiFi repeater:

**CVE-2023-30403 is not mentioned, but the related CVEs (CVE-2023-30402, CVE-2023-30404 and CVE-2023-30405) and their description are described below**

**CVE-2023-30402:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper session management in the web interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The device uses a time-based authentication mechanism instead of session cookies. Once a user logs in, any other user accessing the web interface within the valid time window will automatically be logged in. This results in a **login bypass** vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface, allowing them to change settings.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to reach the web interface. No specific credentials are required since the login is bypassed.

**CVE-2023-30404:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `system` function is used in the web server binary `boa` without proper sanitization of user input.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `FUN_00440290` function, called through a `/boafrm/formSyscmd` POST request, takes user-controlled data and passes it directly to the `system` function. This is a classic **command injection** vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system, leading to full control of the device and RCE.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface. They will have to craft a specific POST request to the `/boafrm/formSyscmd` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access and the ability to send HTTP requests to the device. The login bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-30402) can be used to gain access to this endpoint if the time based authentication window is still open.

**CVE-2023-30405:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Credentials for the device are stored in plain text within the `/config.dat` file, which is accessible via the web interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `/config.dat` file contains device credentials in plain text, presenting an **information disclosure** issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can obtain credentials for the device, which could be used for further attacks, such as bypassing login if the time-based authentication expires.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface. The file is located at the `/config.dat` endpoint.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web interface to obtain this file.

The content also mentions a **stored XSS vulnerability** in the SSID field, but does not specify which CVE id it relates to.

**Additional Points:**

* The analysis includes a deep dive into the hardware (UART, SPI flash memory) and firmware analysis using tools like `binwalk`, `ghidra` and `flashrom`.
* It details how the firmware was extracted, analyzed and how the `system` function vulnerability was located in the `boa` web server.
* The content states that this `formSyscmd` functionality is not part of the standard web app and only exists within the code as a reusable and non-stripped function.

The provided content offers a thorough and technical description of multiple vulnerabilities discovered within the Aigital WiFi repeater, which is much more detailed than a typical CVE description. It includes steps for analysis, tooling, and evidence for the findings.
