        "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in `AdminBundle/Controller/Reports/CustomReportController.php`. This vulnerability, when combined with an SQL Injection, allows an attacker to control exported data and upload a webshell, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution on the server with the webserver's permissions. The vulnerability allows for the creation of arbitrary files and appending data to existing files.",
