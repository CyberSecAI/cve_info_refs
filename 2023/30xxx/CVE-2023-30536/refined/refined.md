{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper validation of header names and values in the `slim/psr7` library, which allows newline characters (`\\n`) to be included.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "An attacker can inject newline characters into HTTP header names and values.",
      "The library's parsing is not strict enough, leading to accepting malformed header names.",
      "The vulnerability could lead to application errors, invalid HTTP requests being sent using PSR-18 clients, and potential denial-of-service if a remote service's WAF bans the application due to malformed requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause application errors, trigger invalid HTTP requests with a PSR-18 client, and potentially cause denial of service if remote web application firewalls block the application due to malformed requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can control header names passed to the `Slim-Psr7` library.",
      "By injecting newline characters into header names, the attacker can craft invalid messages.",
      "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the header names that are passed to the `Slim-Psr7` library.",
