Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Camaleon CMS v2.7.0. This occurs because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `formats` parameter when uploading a file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious template directives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious code into the template engine. The CMS uses a template engine to process the `formats` parameter, which is not sanitized, allowing for code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided in the `formats` parameter, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access, control, and further attacks against other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by intercepting an upload file request and modifying the `formats` parameter.
*   **Malicious Template Directives:** The attacker injects template engine syntax/directives into the `formats` parameter, which then get executed server-side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the HTTP request when a file is uploaded to the CMS.
*   **Knowledge of Template Syntax:** The attacker needs to understand the syntax and functionality of the template engine used by the application to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Access to upload functionality:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload function of the Camaleon CMS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions below 2.7.4
*   The provided exploit uses a payload like `testqopi<%= File.open('/etc/passwd').read %>fdtest` to read the `/etc/passwd` file, indicating the use of Ruby template.
*   The content also details more general information about SSTI vulnerabilities, including detection methods, exploitation techniques, and mitigations.
*  The portswigger.net content provides a detailed explanation of server-side template injection vulnerabilities, including methodology for detection, identification, and exploitation. It explores how different template engines can be exploited, including FreeMarker, Velocity, Smarty, and Twig.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
