Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `QTY` parameter of the Online Pizza Ordering System when updating the cart. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `QTY` parameter in the `ajax.php?action=update_cart_qty` endpoint is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can access sensitive data, including user passwords, credit card details, and personal information.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, depending on the database setup and permissions.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can cause a denial-of-service by injecting SQL queries that consume server resources or cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the `ajax.php?action=update_cart_qty` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload within the `QTY` parameter.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the application.
*   No prior authentication is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited by any user that can add items to their cart.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or modify HTTP requests, for example, by using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content offers much more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically:

*   **Vulnerable Component:** The `QTY` parameter within the `ajax.php?action=update_cart_qty` endpoint is identified as the specific attack vector.
*   **Detailed Steps for Reproduction/Exploitation:** The steps include adding items to the cart, intercepting the request, inserting a single quote to cause an SQL error, and using a payload to confirm the vulnerability.
*  **Specific Payload Example:** A specific time-based SQL injection payload (`CASE WHEN (9603=9603) THEN SLEEP(11) ELSE 9603 END`) is provided as proof of concept.
*   **Visual aids:** Screenshots of the process were included.
