Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30514:

**CVE-2023-30514: Improper masking of credentials in Azure Key Vault Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Azure Key Vault Plugin does not properly mask credentials printed in the build log when specific conditions are met.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Credential Masking:** The plugin fails to replace credentials with asterisks in build logs.
    *   **Conditions for Vulnerability:**
        *   Credentials are printed during build steps executed on an agent (within a `node` block).
        *   Push mode for durable task logging is enabled, either explicitly through the Java system property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING` or implicitly by other plugins.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unmasked credentials can be exposed in build logs. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker who can view build logs or has access to the Jenkins controller can potentially obtain the unmasked credentials.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered during the normal build process when credentials are used.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to Jenkins build logs. This could include users with read access or those with access to the Jenkins controller.
    *   The attacker could be an insider or external attacker who gained access to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Azure Key Vault Plugin versions 187.va\_cd5fecd198a\_ and earlier.
*   A fix is available in version 188.vf46b\_7fa\_846a\_1, which properly masks credentials in the build log when push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
*   The issue is also tracked as SECURITY-3051 in Jenkins.
*   The provided content notes that an improvement in Credentials Binding plugin provides a workaround, but updating the affected plugin is recommended.
