# Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in pay

High

[excid3](/excid3)
published
GHSA-cqf3-vpx7-rxhw
Apr 19, 2023

## Package

bundler

pay
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 6.3.1

## Patched versions

6.3.2

## Description

### Impact

A payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.

### Patches

This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.

Pay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-30614

### Weaknesses

[CWE-80](/advisories?query=cwe%3A80)

|  |  | \* [SECURITY] Fix XSS vulnerability in back parameter on Stripe payment page |
|  |  | Previously, an attacker could inject Javascript or redirect the user to any URL by changing the `back` parameter in the URL. |
|  |  | The `back` parameter is now sanitized and restricted to relative paths. |
|  |  | \* Remove unused attributes for `plan` and `quantity` in `app/models/pay/customer.rb`. |
|  |  | \* Add explicit requires for `active\_support` and `action\_mailer` in `lib/pay.rb`. This should provide better errors for anyone not requiring all of Rails. |
