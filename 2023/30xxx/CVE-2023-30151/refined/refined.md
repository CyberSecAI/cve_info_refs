  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the Boxtal (envoimoinscher) module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:\n\t* Obtain admin access\n\t* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop\n\t* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to exposed tokens and unlock adminsâ€™ ajax scripts\n\t* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and does not require any privileges or user interaction."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Versions > 3.1.10 and <= 3.3.8 of the Boxtal (envoimoinscher) module for PrestaShop are vulnerable.",
  "additional_notes": "The module is no longer maintained, and it's strongly recommended to remove it and migrate to Boxtal Connect. Although a patch is available for version 3.3.8 if requested from Boxtal, it may not fix all known security vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is located in the `/envoimoinscher/controllers/front/ajax.php` file, using the `key` GET parameter with `push` option, and the path of the module controller can be concealed during exploitation within conventional frontend logs. The use of the `pSQL()` function and other recommendations to improve security are also detailed."
