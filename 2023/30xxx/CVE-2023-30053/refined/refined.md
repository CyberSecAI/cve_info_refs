{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application takes user-controlled input from the `iptvVer` parameter and passes it to the `Uci_Set_Str` function. This function uses `snprintf` to format the input into a string, then passes that string to the `cstesystem` function. The `cstesystem` function directly calls `execv` with the user-controlled string, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection",
     "Improper input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a malicious `iptvVer` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically on the local network. The attacker does not need any authentication credentials for this exploit."
