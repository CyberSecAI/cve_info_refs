### @zzmp **[zzmp](/zzmp)** commented [Feb 1, 2023](#issue-1565688592) • edited Loading

Serially requests `accounts` and then `chainId`, so that if a user changes chains whilst connecting, the new chain (after connection / `accounts`) will be used. Practically, this prevents web3-react from using incorrect initial state when connecting to certain wallets, in certain cases where the user selects a non-active chain. This is resolved by waiting for `accounts` to settle before requesting `chainId`.

---

For `chainId` and `accounts`, the values were fetched using a `Promise.all`. In some wallets, `chainId` resolves immediately, and then the user is prompted to change chains. In these cases, `chainId` will be outdated by the time `accounts` resolves:

1. `eth_chainId` resolves to "stale" chain
2. user is prompted to connect with a chain selector
3. user selects a different "active" chain
4. `chainChanged` is emitted
5. `eth_accounts` resolves, resolving the `Promise.all` with an out-of-date `chainId`

NB: WalletConnect did not exhibit this bug, but I updated it to keep it in sync with other connectors' idioms. It likely already had this "fix" in it, based on existing comments.

Sorry, something went wrong.

wow this is really subtle, nice catch. i have a concern about the metamask change, see comment

the non-null assertions felt a little clunky but i went through them all and i didn't see anything problematic; it's maybe slightly worse because we're now relying on the coinbase wallet/metamask providers to set properties correctly, but doesn't really bother me

Sorry, something went wrong.

nit: probably out of scope for this PR, but I would consider adding to a todo list: potential candidate for abstracting away? Looks like a common code path here and few lines earlier.

I think that web3-react *is* the abstraction but, more importantly, I don't want to make this a large change because it's meant to be a bug fix.

Question about this `eager` flag. I don't see it being used before? We were running `eth_accounts` in both instances. Is this change intentional?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Ok, I see this has to do with `eager` that can be `true` or `false`, depending on the call-site. Is there a better way to describe its intent? Is it something like connect if already authorised vs explicitly authorise? In that case, why fallback to `eth_accounts` when `eth_requestAccounts` failed? This is probably a bit out of scope for this PR, but a good opportunity to expand my `web3-react` knowledge a bit!

I believe this is done because EIP1193 does not necessarily support eth\_requestAccounts, so a fallback is necessary. You don't see this in other connectors because they are not explicitly EIP1193 connectors.

The codepaths for connectEagerly and activate were identical except for the usage of eth\_accounts vs eth\_requestAccounts, so I added connect as a shared method to express that with less code duplication.

I've refactored to `activateAccounts(requestAccounts: () => Promise<string[]>)`.

follow-up to my previous question: why no fallback to `eth_accounts` here?

MetaMask is known to implement this method, whereas a pure EIP1193 may not.

nit: maybe `chainId` should already be parsed? `parseChainId(await ....)`, otherwise I think this line is a bit confusing: `chainId: parseChainId(chainId)` vs `this.actions.update({ chainId })`

If considered a worthy nit, this most likely applies to other files too.

fwiw, I agree with you here, but I don't want to change it because it expands the scope of this PR - I've omitted it to de-risk this bug fix.

# `chainId` may be outdated if user changes chains as part of connection

## Description

### Impact

`chainId` may be outdated if the user changes chains as part of the connection flow. This means that the value of `chainId` returned by `useWeb3React()` may be incorrect. In an application, this means that any data derived from `chainId` could be incorrect.

For example, if a swapping application derives a wrapped token contract address from the `chainId` *and* a user has changed chains as part of their connection flow the application could cause the user to send funds to the incorrect address when wrapping. This is a common approach when using other foundational libraries like [`ethers`](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js), and most users of v8 will want to upgrade past the affected versions.

### Patches

Patched in [#749](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/pull/749).

Users of web3-react@8.0.x-beta.0 should upgrade to at least:

* @web3-react/coinbase-wallet@^8.0.35-beta.0
* @web3-react/eip1193@^8.0.27-beta.0
* @web3-react/metamask@^8.0.30-beta.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
