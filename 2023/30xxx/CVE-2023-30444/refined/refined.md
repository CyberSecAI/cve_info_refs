- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to SSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can be exploited to make requests to internal servers or other resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly described but involves sending crafted requests that the server will interpret and process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to make requests that would be processed by the IBM Watson Machine Learning on Cloud Pak for Data instance.
