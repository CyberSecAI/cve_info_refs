The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Online Food Ordering System v2.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/fos/admin/ajax.php?action=save_menu` file, which allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not validate the type or content of uploaded files.
- Lack of input sanitization: The system doesn't sanitize the uploaded file content.
- Direct access to uploaded files: Uploaded files can be accessed directly through the web browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file containing malicious code, which can then be executed by accessing the file via the web browser.
- Complete system compromise: Successful RCE can grant an attacker full control of the web server, potentially leading to data breaches, server hijacking, or further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/fos/admin/ajax.php?action=save_menu`
- Malicious file upload within a multipart/form-data request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No authentication or specific user privileges are mentioned as prerequisites in the provided text, however it is implied that the attacker may need admin privileges due to the location of the vulnerable script.
