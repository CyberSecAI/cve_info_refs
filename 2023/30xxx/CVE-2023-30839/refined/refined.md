{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient filtering of SQL queries within the SQL Manager functionality, specifically within the `executeS` method of the `Db` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89): The lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated back office (BO) user with low privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to write, update, and delete data in the database, bypassing intended access controls. This can lead to complete compromise of the application data, integrity, and availability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs low-level access to the PrestaShop back office."
  },
  "fix": {
      "description": "The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check in the `executeS` method to ensure it is used only with `select`, `show`, `explain`, `describe` or `desc` SQL queries. The fix prevents the execution of SQL queries that are not intended for data retrieval, thus preventing database modification.",
