- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating a new channel, allowing for the injection of malicious script tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores the malicious payload in the channel description, and it's rendered when a user views that channel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application to create a new channel.  The vulnerability is triggered when another user views the channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid account to create channels. No elevated privileges are needed.
