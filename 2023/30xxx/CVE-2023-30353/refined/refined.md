- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Tenda CP3 camera exposes a service that allows sending a 'forget' XML string via a POST request. This service is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of the input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary commands can be executed with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious XML payload to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
