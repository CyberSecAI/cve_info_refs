Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a **Broken Access Control** issue. Specifically, it's due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the "Featured Post Creative" WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the failure to properly enforce access controls. The plugin does not verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform specific actions.
*   **Missing Authorization/Authentication/Nonce Checks:** The specific technical implementation is lacking authorization checks, authentication procedures or nonce token verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited, however, specific impact varies case by case.
*   Unprivileged users could execute higher-privileged actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modification or access to sensitive data or plugin settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a function within the WordPress plugin "Featured Post Creative."
*   The specific function that is vulnerable is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. This means an unauthenticated user can perform the higher privileged actions.
