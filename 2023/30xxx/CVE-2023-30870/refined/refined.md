- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin lacks proper checks to verify if a user is authorized to perform certain actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that they should not be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper authorization checks in the plugin's code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning they can be a completely unprivileged user.
