What is the reason for the large number of unfixed vulnerabilities?
To me, this seems like an argument for not using Jenkins (or at least
its plugins) at all.

## Descriptions

### Improper masking of credentials in multiple plugins

**SECURITY-3075
/
CVE-2023-30513 (Kubernetes), CVE-2023-30514 (Azure Key Vault), CVE-2023-30515 (Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugins:
[`kubernetes`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes)
,

[`azure-keyvault`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-keyvault)
,

[`thycotic-devops-secrets-vault`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/thycotic-devops-secrets-vault)**

**Description:**

Multiple plugins do not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials printed in the build log from Pipeline steps like `sh` and `bat`, when both of the following conditions are met:

* The credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent (typically inside a `node` block).
* Push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
  This is a hidden option in [Pipeline: Nodes and Processes](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step/) that can be enabled through the [Java system property](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING`.
  It is also automatically enabled by some plugins, e.g., [OpenTelemetry](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/) and [Pipeline Logging over CloudWatch](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-cloudwatch-logs/).

The following plugins are affected by this vulnerability:

* Kubernetes 3909.v1f2c633e8590 and earlier (SECURITY-3079 / CVE-2023-30513)
* Azure Key Vault 187.va\_cd5fecd198a\_ and earlier (SECURITY-3051 / CVE-2023-30514)
* Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault 1.0.0 (SECURITY-3078 / CVE-2023-30515)

The following plugins have been updated to properly mask credentials in the build log when push mode for durable task logging is enabled:

* Kubernetes 3910.ve59cec5e33ea\_ (SECURITY-3079 / CVE-2023-30513)
* Azure Key Vault 188.vf46b\_7fa\_846a\_1 (SECURITY-3051 / CVE-2023-30514)

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the following plugin:

* Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault 1.0.0 (SECURITY-3078 / CVE-2023-30515)

|  | An improvement in [Credentials Binding](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/) 523.525.vb\_72269281873 implements a workaround that applies build log masking even in affected plugins. This workaround is temporary and potentially incomplete, so it is still recommended that affected plugins be updated to resolve this issue. |

Consul KV Builder Plugin 2.0.13 and earlier stores the HashiCorp Consul ACL Token unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.consulkv.GlobalConsulConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the global configuration form does not mask the token, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
