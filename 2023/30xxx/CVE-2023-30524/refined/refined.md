Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30524:

**CVE-2023-30524:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Report Portal Plugin stores ReportPortal access tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the configuration form does not mask these tokens when displayed in the UI.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Plaintext Storage:** Access tokens are stored in plain text within the `config.xml` files, making them easily accessible if an attacker gains access to the file system.
    *   **Lack of Input Masking:** The configuration form displays the token without masking, increasing the risk of exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `Item/Extended Read` permissions or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view and capture the unencrypted access tokens. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the Report Portal and potentially other systems, depending on the scope of the access token.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access to Jenkins controller file system:** If the attacker gets access to the filesystem they can directly read the config.xml files
    *   **Jenkins UI**: Attacker with `Item/Extended Read` permission can access the job configuration through the Jenkins UI and view the unmasked access tokens.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs `Item/Extended Read` permission on Jenkins jobs or
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability is associated with SECURITY-2945, and is one of two vulnerabilities in the Report Portal Plugin (the other being CVE-2023-30523).
*   There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the advisory's publication date.
