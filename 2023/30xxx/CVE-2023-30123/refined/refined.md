The provided content relates to CVE-2023-30123.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the "Member Center - Account Settings" of WUZHI CMS 4.1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as:
- Stealing user cookies/session tokens.
- Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- Defacing the website.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload `"><details/open/ontoggle=alert('/xss/')>` into the "Member Center - Account Settings".
- When a user views the profile or related page where the settings are displayed, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account and be logged in to access and modify the Member Center settings.
