Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the unsafe concatenation of user-supplied input with SQL queries within the `Archery` project. Specifically, the `db_name` and `tb_name` parameters in the `table_info` method of `data_dictionary.py` are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-controlled values are directly inserted into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query's structure and logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive data stored in the databases connected to Archery. This includes database schemas, user information, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious `db_name` and `tb_name` parameters to the vulnerable `table_info` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low-level privileges (e.g., a user with access to the Archery application) can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Instance Names:** To exploit most SQL injections, the attacker needs to know the instance names defined in Archery. This could be obtained through reconnaissance or by already having limited access to the application.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for successful exploitation. The attacker can directly send the malicious requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `sql/data_dictionary.py` file's `table_info` method is the entry point for the vulnerability. The `db_name` and `tb_name` parameters from the HTTP request are passed to methods in different database engine implementations (`mssql.py` and `oracle.py`).
*   In `mssql.py`, the `get_table_meta_data`, `get_table_desc_data`, and `get_table_index_data` methods concatenate user input into SQL queries that are then executed by the `query` method.
*   Similarly, in `oracle.py`, the `get_table_meta_data`, `get_table_desc_data`, and `get_table_index_data` methods concatenate user input into SQL queries, which are later executed.
*   The vulnerability affects all databases connected to Archery because the controller methods are connected to them without sanitizing input.

**Remediation:**

*   The suggested remediation involves escaping the user input for `db_name` and `tb_name` parameters in `data_dictionary.py`'s `table_info` method. The example provided suggests using `MySQLdb.escape()` (or similar methods for other database engines).
*   The advisory also suggests using prepared statements with placeholders as a more secure approach for preventing SQL injection.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**
    *   **AV:N** (Network): The attack can be performed over a network.
    *   **AC:L** (Low): The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:L** (Low): The attacker requires low privileges.
    *   **UI:N** (None): No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:U** (Unchanged): The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the security scope.
    *   **C:H** (High): There is a high impact on data confidentiality.
    *   **I:N** (None): There is no impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:N** (None): There is no impact on availability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also recommends escaping other variables that accept user input, particularly from GET or POST requests.
*   The report was made by GHSL team member Sylwia Budzynska.
