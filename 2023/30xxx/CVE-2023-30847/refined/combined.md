# invalid memory read in proxy handler

High

[kazuho](/kazuho)
published
GHSA-p5hj-phwj-hrvx
Apr 27, 2023

## Package

h2o
(C)

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

commit f010336

## Description

### Impact

When the reverse proxy handler tries to processes a certain type of invalid HTTP request, it tries to build an upstream URL by reading from uninitialized pointer. This behavior can lead to crashes or leak of information to back end HTTP servers.

### Patches

PR [#3229](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/3229) fixes the issue. The pull request has been merged to master in commit [f010336](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/f010336bab162839df43d9e87570897466c97e33).

### Workarounds

Upgrade to commit [f010336](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/f010336bab162839df43d9e87570897466c97e33) or later. At the moment, there is no tagged version with the fix incorporated.

None of the non-beta released versions (i.e., versions up to 2.2.6) is affected by this vulnerability (May 15 2023).

### Acknowledgements

This issue was reported by [@ElijahGlover](https://github.com/ElijahGlover); see [#3228](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/3228).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

### @kazuho **[kazuho](/kazuho)** commented [Apr 27, 2023](#issue-1686726053)

When handling certain type of malformed request received in HTTP/1, the reverse proxy uses an uninitialized pointer to read from memory.

Closes [#3228](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/3228). Security Advisory is coming.

Sorry, something went wrong.
