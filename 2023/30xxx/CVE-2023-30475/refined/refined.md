  - Stealing sensitive information (if the injected script contains malicious code to do so).
  - Compromising user accounts.
  - Other malicious activities depending on the injected payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the plugin's interface.
- The specific input field or functionality vulnerable is not specified, but the attack involves injecting malicious code via the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable functionality of the plugin to inject the malicious script.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
- A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability.
