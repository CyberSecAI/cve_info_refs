Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-30356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of integrity checks during the firmware update process of the Tenda CP3 IP Camera. This allows the device to accept and install maliciously modified firmware images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** Although listed, this is not detailed in the provided text but it could relate to the possibility of using hardcoded credentials to access the device.
*   **CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check:** The core issue is the absence of a mechanism to verify the integrity of the firmware update. This allows an attacker to bypass any security measures and upload malicious firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Firmware Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite the official firmware with their own modified version.
*   **Persistent Modification:** The changes to the firmware are persistent, meaning they will remain even after device reboots or power cycles.
*   **Prevention of Future Updates:** The malicious firmware can block future legitimate firmware updates.
*   **Potential for Complete Control:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain control over the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously Forged Firmware Images:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a custom firmware image with malicious modifications.
*   **Update Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger the camera's update procedure to upload the malicious image, the way in which this is done is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Create/Modify Firmware:** Attackers must have the capability to create a modified firmware image.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker likely requires network access to the camera to initiate the update procedure. The specific method for triggering the update is not detailed, therefore, further attacker capabilities can not be specified from the information provided.

**Additional Notes**
*   The tested version of the Tenda IP Camera CP3 is V11.10.00.2211041355.
*   The CVSSv3 score is noted as "TBA" (To Be Announced).
