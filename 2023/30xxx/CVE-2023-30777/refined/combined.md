How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

# Reflected XSS in Advanced Custom Fields Plugins Affecting 2+ Million Sites

[Security advisories](https://patchstack.com/category/security-advisories/)
[Security Advisory](https://patchstack.com/tag/security-advisory/)
Published 5 May 2023Updated 13 December 2024![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1afc8ea1128a413b5780e102a8032b6f?s=200&d=mm&r=g)[Rafie Muhammad](https://patchstack.com/author/rafie/)Security Researcher at PatchstackTable of Contents

[#### WordPress Advanced Custom Fields Plugin 5.8.10-5.12.5

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/advanced-custom-fields/wordpress-advanced-custom-fields-plugin-6-1-5-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability)
[#### WordPress Advanced Custom Fields PRO Plugin <= 6.1.5

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/advanced-custom-fields-pro/wordpress-advanced-custom-fields-pro-plugin-6-1-5-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability)

This blog post is about the Advanced Custom Fields free and pro plugin vulnerability. If youâre an Advanced Custom Fields free and pro user, please update the plugin to at least version **6.1.6**. The security fix also backported on version **5.12.6**.

**Patchstack [Developer and Enterprise Plan](https://patchstack.com/pricing/) users are protected from the vulnerability.**

You can also sign up for the [Patchstack Community plan](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) to be notified about vulnerabilities as soon as they become disclosed.

For plugin developers, we haveÂ [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/)Â andÂ [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/)Â for hosting companies.

## Update regarding exploitation attempts

As we are writing this update on 16 May 2023, we notice claims circulating in the media that the sample PoC URL on this article is being used to mass-exploit websites. We found that to be unlikely since the XSS could only be triggered by logged-in users (mainly administrators) that have access to the Advanced Custom Fields feature. We assume that the attacker tries to directly hit the sample PoC URL and it doesnât indicates that the attempt is a concrete exploitation. This case mostly applies across vulnerabilities that require user interaction such as CSRF and Reflected XSS. Until this update is published, our monitoring system didnât catch any concrete exploitation attempts on our customers.

## About the Advanced Custom Fields WordPress plugin

The plugin [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) and [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) (versions **6.1.5** and below, free and pro version), has over 2 million active installations. It is known as the most popular custom fields plugins in WordPress.

This plugin is a WordPress plugin that allows us to add extra content fields to our WordPress edit screens. These extra content fields are more commonly referred to as Custom Fields and can allow us to build websites faster with more available fields.

## The security vulnerability in Advanced Custom Fields

This plugin suffers from reflected XSS vulnerability.

**This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user from stealing sensitive information to, in this case, privilege escalation on the WordPress site by tricking privileged users to visit the crafted URL path.**

The described vulnerability was fixed in version **6.1.6**, also fixed in version **5.12.6,** and assigned **CVE-2023-30777**.

[Find out more from the Patchstack database](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/advanced-custom-fields/wordpress-advanced-custom-fields-plugin-6-1-5-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability) and [here](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/advanced-custom-fields-pro/wordpress-advanced-custom-fields-pro-plugin-6-1-5-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability).

The underlying vulnerability is located on `admin_body_class` function handler:

```
public function admin_body_class( $classes ) {
    $classes .= " acf-admin-page acf-internal-post-type {$this->admin_body_class}";

    if ( $this->view ) {
        $classes .= " view-{$this->view}";
    }

    return $classes;
}
```

The `admin_body_class` configured to be an extra handler of WordPress own hook that is also named `[admin_body_class](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_body_class/)`. This hook controls and filters the CSS classes for the main body tag in the admin area.

```
// Add hooks.
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', array( $this, 'admin_enqueue_scripts' ) );
add_action( 'admin_body_class', array( $this, 'admin_body_class' ) );
```

If we look deeper at the implementation of the `[admin_body_class](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_body_class/)` on WordPress core, we could see that the outputted value of the hook is not properly sanitized and directly constructed on the HTML page :

```
$admin_body_classes = apply_filters( 'admin_body_class', '' );
$admin_body_classes = ltrim( $admin_body_classes . ' ' . $admin_body_class );
?>
<body class="wp-admin wp-core-ui no-js <?php echo $admin_body_classes; ?>">
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.body.className = document.body.className.replace('no-js','js');
</script>
```

Because of that condition, there is a potential XSS vulnerability if the `admin_body_class` hook function handler doesnât properly sanitized the returned classes string.

Letâs get back to the hook function handler, the code will directly concatenated `$this->view` variable to the `$classes` variable that will be returned as classes string. We actually could fully control the `$this->view` variable from `current_screen` function :

```
public function current_screen() {
    // Bail early if not the list admin page.
    if ( ! acf_is_screen( "edit-{$this->post_type}" ) ) {
        return;
    }

    // Get the current view.
    $this->view = isset( $_GET['post_status'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_GET['post_status'] ) : ''; //
-------------------------------------
```

Sanitization using `[sanitize_text_field](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/sanitize_text_field/)` function is not enough to prevent XSS, since we could still use a DOM XSS payload. Combining all of that, the XSS could be achieved using this example payload :

```
http://<WORDPRESS_SITE>/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=acf-field-group&post_status=xxxxxxx" onload=alert(document.domain) xxx="
```

The reflected HTML structure that is being shown on the front-end could be something like this :

```
<body class="wp-admin wp-core-ui no-js acf-admin-5-3 acf-browser-chrome acf-admin-page acf-internal-post-type acf-admin-field-groups view-xxxxxxx\" onload=alert(document.domain) xxx=\" edit-php auto-fold admin-bar post-type-acf-field-group branch-6-2 version-6-2 admin-color-fresh locale-en-us no-customize-support no-svg">

```

Note that this vulnerability could be triggered on a default installation or configuration of the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. The XSS also could only be triggered by logged-in users that have access to the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

## The patch in Advanced Custom Fields

Since this issue is mainly because the code directly constructed a variable to the HTML without proper sanitization, implementing `[esc_attr](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr/)` function should be enough to patch the issue. The [patch](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2908095/advanced-custom-fields/tags/6.1.6/includes/admin/admin-internal-post-type-list.php?old=2892912&old_path=advanced-custom-fields%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fadmin%2Fadmin-internal-post-type-list.php) can be found below :

![Advanced Custom Fields](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-8-1024x361.png)

There are many WordPress hook functions that are used across plugin and theme codes. One of them is `admin_body_class` hook. Make sure to sanitize the classes string that outputted when using the hook using sanitize function like `[esc_attr](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr/)`.
