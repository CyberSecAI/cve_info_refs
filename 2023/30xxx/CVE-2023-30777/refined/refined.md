Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-30777:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:**
*   WordPress Advanced Custom Fields Plugin (versions 5.8.10 - 5.12.5)
*   WordPress Advanced Custom Fields PRO Plugin (versions <= 6.1.5)

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `admin_body_class` function handler in the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. This function is hooked to the WordPress `admin_body_class` hook, which is responsible for adding CSS classes to the `<body>` tag in the admin area.
*   The plugin's code concatenates the `$this->view` variable directly to the CSS classes string without proper sanitization before outputting it to the HTML.
*   The `$this->view` variable is derived from the `post_status` parameter in the URL's GET request, which is sanitized using `sanitize_text_field()`. However, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks. Specifically, it does not prevent DOM based XSS.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the malicious payload is injected through the URL parameters and reflected back in the HTML output.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The `sanitize_text_field()` function is not enough to prevent XSS, allowing an attacker to craft a payload that can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. Specifically the function doesn't prevent DOM XSS.
*  **Improper use of WordPress hook:** The `admin_body_class` hook is designed to allow filtering of css classes but it's used in a way that allows injection of unsanitized parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious actor can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin pages of the WordPress site.
*   This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Stealing sensitive information.
    *   Privilege escalation by tricking privileged users to visit the crafted URL.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    *   Modifying the site's content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `post_status` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient access to visit the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user, that has access to the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, into clicking on the malicious URL. The user needs to be logged into the admin area of the WordPress site.
*   The vulnerability is triggered within the WordPress admin panel, therefore the attacker will not be able to execute the payload to unauthenticated users.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both the free and PRO versions of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
*   The fix involves using `esc_attr()` to properly sanitize the outputted CSS class string.
*   Exploitation requires user interaction (clicking a link) which makes mass exploitation less likely.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Rafie Muhammad from Patchstack.
*  The vulnerability was fixed in versions 5.12.6 and 6.1.6
