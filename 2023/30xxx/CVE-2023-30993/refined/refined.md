Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) that allows an attacker with a valid API key for one tenant to access data belonging to another tenant's account.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is an apparent lack of proper tenant isolation or access control within the CP4S platform, leading to unauthorized data access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to other tenants within the CP4S environment.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the CP4S API using a valid API key that is not associated with the victim tenant.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs a valid API key for at least one tenant on the CP4S system to exploit the vulnerability.
