# ReDoS vulnerability in `replace` function

Moderate

[eliassjogreen](/eliassjogreen)
published
GHSA-w2xx-hjhp-gx5v
Apr 28, 2023

## Package

emoji
(deno)

## Affected versions

< 0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.3.0

## Description

### Impact

The reTrimSpace regex has 2nd degree polynomial inefficiency, leading to a delayed response given a big payload.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in 0.3.0 ([#11](https://github.com/denosaurs/emoji/pull/11)) and all users are recommended to upgrade to the latest version. It is fully compatible with previous versions.

### Workarounds

Not using the `replace`, `unemojify` or `strip` functions.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
