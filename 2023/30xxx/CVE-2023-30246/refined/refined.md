Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-30246:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `edit_contestant_txtcode.php` file of the Judging Management System v1.0. The `contestant_id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`contestant_id`) before using it in the SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application constructs SQL queries using string concatenation with user-supplied input, rather than using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., database name).
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges and gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/php-jms/edit_contestant_txtcode.php` and injecting SQL code into the `contestant_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is specifically mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `contestant_id`
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/php-jms/edit_contestant_txtcode.php`
*   **Payload Example:** `/php-jms/edit_contestant_txtcode.php?sub_event_id=1&se_name=&contestant_id=-1' union select 1,2,3,4,5,database(),7,8--+`
*  **Database name:** jms_db
