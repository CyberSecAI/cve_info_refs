Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-30130:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary Twig template code into the "Title Format" field when editing entry types in Craft CMS. This occurs within the admin panel, specifically when creating a new section with the Single's Section Type and then editing its entry types, or editing entry types within existing sections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary vulnerability is that the application doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided input in the "Title Format" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious Twig template code.
- **Head host poisoning**: The reset password functionality is vulnerable to head host poisoning, where the attacker can manipulate the reset link sent to the victim's email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious Twig code using `file_get_contents` and `file_put_contents` functions, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided example shows how to download a PHP script and save it as a shell, which allows for further exploitation such as executing commands on the server.
- **Account Takeover:** The head host poisoning vulnerability allows the attacker to take over target accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed through the Craft CMS admin panel, by navigating to the section settings and modifying the entry type title format.
- The attacker needs to have an account with necessary permissions to access the admin panel and modify these settings.
- Head Host Poisoning is achieved by manipulating the Host header during the password reset process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an authenticated session with sufficient privileges to access the admin panel and modify section and entry type settings.
- For Head Host Poisoning, the attacker must be able to send a request with a modified `Host` header.
