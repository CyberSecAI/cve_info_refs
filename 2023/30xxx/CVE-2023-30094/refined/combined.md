| Tested version: (latest, docker)  Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:   * Login in the application. * Click on settings. * Set `"<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` as platform name and save. * Logout and XSS will fire.

| [@edoardottt](https://github.com/edoardottt) Thank you. In the Total.js 4 framework, I have fixed the issue [totaljs/framework4@e2cea69](https://github.com/totaljs/framework4/commit/e2cea690c3fe4453e94da896a69f832511f65179). There was a missing encoding configuration value for the specific declaration.  You can test it with the Flow: `$ npm install total4@beta`. |
