{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided URLs in comments. Specifically, the `url` parameter in the comment form is filtered only at the beginning, and any remaining part of the URL is directly echoed into the HTML without proper encoding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the comment section. This code is then executed when other users view the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing attacks, or defacement of the website for other users.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves submitting a comment containing a malicious JavaScript payload within the `url` parameter of the comment form. The attacker posts a crafted comment to a blog post on the target website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to post a comment on the affected blog to exploit the vulnerability. No special privileges or prior knowledge of the system are required."
