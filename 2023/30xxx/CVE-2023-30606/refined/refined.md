- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized dynamic dispatch to the `SiteSetting` class allows an administrator to call arbitrary methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of input sanitization when handling dynamic dispatch to `SiteSetting`, enabling invocation of sensitive methods.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, logged in as administrator, can call methods like `#clear_cache!` and `#notify_changed!` on a multisite installation, which can disrupt the entire cluster. This results in a denial-of-service for the entire cluster.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be logged in as an administrator. User interaction is required, as it would necessitate an administrator initiating the method call.
