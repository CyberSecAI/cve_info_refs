Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30362:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `coap_send_internal` function of the libcoap library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs within the `strstr` function call after inserting a null terminator in the `pdu->data`. The length of `data_len`, used for null termination, isn't properly validated, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow read/write due to lack of bounds checking
- Improper calculation of data length before writing a null terminator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can obtain sensitive information through out-of-bounds memory access via a crafted PDU (Protocol Data Unit).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malformed PDU to a vulnerable system using the coap protocol that exploits the vulnerable `coap_send` function that internally calls `coap_send_internal`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to a system using the vulnerable libcoap library.
- Ability to craft and send a specially crafted CoAP PDU.
- No privileges or user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.3.0 with the addition of RFC8768 support and was fixed in version 4.3.1-120-ge242200.
- The fix involves checking if there's enough space for the null terminator before writing it to the buffer.
- The fix also includes additional error handling to prevent writing out of bounds and also adding a check if the resize of the pdu fails.
- The vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
- The vulnerable code is in `src/net.c` in the `coap_send_internal` function.
- The affected versions includes libcoap library 4.3.1-103-g52cfd56.
- Version 4.2.1 and earlier are not affected by the vulnerability.
