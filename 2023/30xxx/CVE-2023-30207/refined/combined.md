## Description

![@zj3t](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35731091?u=d1ceea8bd40c161e1000e4f882d240c494dc3d2b&v=4&size=48)[zj3t](https://github.com/zj3t)opened [on Jan 3, 2023](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/22378#issue-1517123087)
## Bug report

### Describe the bug

After inserting the wrong/malformed mp3 file into the USB storage device and mounting it,

I played the mp3 file on kodi. After that, a crash occurred.

## Expected Behavior

If you include an invalid mp3(media) file, the kodi process crashes, you can check the memory address through the internal crash log.

## Actual Behavior

## Possible Fix

Please check the attached crash report information. It is reporting which functions are crashing.

Probably, if you check the header so that only normal mp3 files can be run on kodi, you can defend it enough.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Save the attached mp3 file to a USB storage device.
2. After recognizing the USB storage device in an environment that can operate kodi, such as Raspberry Pi, run the Music application inside kodi.
3. After a while the process crashes.
4. If you need a crash log dump, you can enable the log dump option in preferences within kodi.

### Debuglog

I will attach it.

### Screenshots

Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:

Sorry. Kodi crashed and quit at the same time, so I couldn't take a picture.

If you need, I will connect VNC to add a screenshot.!!

thanks.

### CrashFile

## Additional context or screenshots (if appropriate)

Here is some additional context or explanation that might help:

### Your Environment

Used Operating system:

* Android
* iOS
* tvOS
* [v] Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* Windows UWP
* Operating system version/name:
* Kodi version: Latest Version.

Thanks~!!

*note: Once the issue is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required.

Team Kodi will consider your problem report however, we will not make any promises the problem will be solved.*

### @fritsch **[fritsch](/fritsch)** commented [Jan 4, 2023](#issue-1518485063)

When parsing a file failed so that needed fields, in our case frameSize are not available a guess work like with m\_channels or m\_samplerate does not help. Therefore fail early.

Fixes: [#22378](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/22378)
