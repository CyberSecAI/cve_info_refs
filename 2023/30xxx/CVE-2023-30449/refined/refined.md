**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in IBM Db2 versions 10.5.0.11, 11.1.4.7, and 11.5.x.
- It is caused by a specially crafted query that can trigger a denial-of-service condition.
- The specific nature of the crafted query and the underlying vulnerability within Db2 are not disclosed by IBM to avoid aiding potential attackers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Db2 handles certain types of database queries, leading to resource exhaustion or other conditions that result in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This means the database becomes unavailable, disrupting services that depend on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious, specially crafted query to the affected Db2 server.
- The attack vector is network-based, as the query is sent to the server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send queries to the Db2 server, implying network connectivity to the database server.
-  The attacker does not require any special privileges, as the vulnerability can be triggered by a query, regardless of the user's database permissions. The CVSS score indicates a "PR:N" (Privileges Required: None) for this vulnerability.
