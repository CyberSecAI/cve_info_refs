- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Hitachi Ops Center Analyzer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted request containing malicious script that is reflected back to the user's browser. The attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or otherwise sending the crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and convince a user to interact with it. The CVSS score indicates that user interaction is required, and an attacker needs to have low privileges to execute the attack.
