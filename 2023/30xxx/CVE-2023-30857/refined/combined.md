# Possible prototype pollution in metadata record, when using meta decorator

Low

[aedart](/aedart)
published
GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6
Apr 28, 2023

## Package

npm

@aedart/support
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

0.6.0

## Patched versions

0.6.1

## Description

### Impact

Possible prototype pollution for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package.

The likelihood is questionable, given that a class' metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can become a vulnerability.

### Patches

Has been patched in version `0.6.1`.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-30857

### Weaknesses

[CWE-1321](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1321)

Fix possible prototype pollution

```
Not entirely sure how likely this will ever be for metadata, but just in case that the entire metadata record's prototype is attempted polluted, then this will prevent it.
