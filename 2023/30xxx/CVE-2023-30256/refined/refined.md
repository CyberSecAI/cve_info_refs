Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-30256

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The QloApps application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in two parameters: `email_create` and `back`. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.

**Weaknesses:**
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation
- Improper handling of user-supplied parameters
- Lack of output encoding/escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser, leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Cookie theft
- Defacement of the website
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`back` parameter:** The attacker can craft a URL with a malicious payload within the `back` parameter and trick a user into clicking the link.
- **`email_create` parameter:** The attacker can include malicious JavaScript within the `email_create` parameter during the account creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL or POST request containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the crafted URL or submit the crafted POST request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in QloApps version 1.5.2.
- The `back` parameter vulnerability can be exploited via a GET request by encoding the payload or plain text.
- The `email_create` parameter vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request by encoding the payload.
- Example payloads for the `back` parameter include:
    - `[xss onfocus=alert(1) autofocus= xss]`
    - `[xss%20onfocus%3dalert(1)%20autofocus%3d%20xss]`
- Example payloads for the `email_create` parameter include:
    - `[xss><img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>xss]`
    - `[xss%3e%3cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(document.cookie)%3exss]`

**Additional Notes**
- The github repository provides PoC images demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
- The vendor is notified about the issue through email (support@qloapps.com).
