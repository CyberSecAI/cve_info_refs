{
  "CVE-2023-30625": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application constructs SQL queries by directly embedding user-provided input (specifically, `source_id` and `taskRunID`) into the query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Blind SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious SQL code.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The `v1/warehouse/pending-events` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `source_id` parameter. ",
        "The `v1/failed-events` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `taskRunID` parameter when forming the table name."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoints."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper table name escaping in failed event handling.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for unauthorized data access or modification through crafted table names.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Manipulating the `taskRunID` parameter in the `/v1/failed-events` endpoint to inject SQL into the table name."

      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to interact with the `failed-events` endpoint, specifically by manipulating taskRunID parameter"
