- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Exploitation of the Distributed Data Management (DDM) architecture in IBM i.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute CL (Control Language) commands on the IBM i system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary CL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access via the DDM architecture.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM i system.
