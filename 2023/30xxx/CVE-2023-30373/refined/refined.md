The provided content describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC15 router firmware, specifically in the `xian_pppoe_user` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `xian_pppoe_user` function reads a user-provided parameter without performing any length checks before passing it to another function. This allows for an overflow of a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Remote code execution (RCE)

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted request to the page where `xian_pppoe_user` is called, overflowing the stack buffer with malicious data

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable page, suggesting network accessibility to the router.
- Ability to craft a malicious payload to cause overflow and subsequent actions (DoS or RCE).

**Additional details:**
- The content specifies the affected firmware version (US_AC15V1.0BR_V15.03.05.19) and provides a link to the official Tenda download page.
- Although a specific PoC is not provided due to legal and policy reasons, it describes how the vulnerability is triggered.
- The vulnerability could be exploited for denial of service, or remote code execution with a carefully crafted overflow.
