  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of HTML tags within plaintext messages when displaying search results. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or escape HTML content in the message body before rendering it in the search results view.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]",
        "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') [CWE-74]"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML, including JavaScript, into a message, and when a user searches for that message, the injected HTML will be rendered in the search results. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where the attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the application's search functionality. An attacker would need to send a message that contains HTML injection payload.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a message on the system and have a victim search for that specific message. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges in the system."
