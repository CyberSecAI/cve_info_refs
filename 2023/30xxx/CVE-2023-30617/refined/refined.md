- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The kruise-daemon pod has excessive permissions that allow it to list all secrets in the entire cluster.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The kruise-daemon role has the `get` and `list` privilege for secrets at the cluster level. This is a case of excessive privileges granted to a service account.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has gained root access to a node where the `kruise-daemon` pod runs can leverage the pod's service account to list all secrets in the cluster. These secrets could then be used to gain further privileges, such as modifying pods via the kruise-manager service account token.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to achieve root access on a node where the `kruise-daemon` pod is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have root access to a node hosting the `kruise-daemon` pod.
