- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation that included sensitive AWS access key, secret key, and security token in plaintext when debug-formatted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive credentials due to the inclusion of plaintext access keys, secret keys, and security tokens in debug output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of AWS credentials to anyone with access to logs when TRACE-level logging is enabled, potentially allowing unauthorized access to AWS resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to logs where TRACE-level logging is enabled for the AWS SDK for Rust or specifically for the `aws-sigv4` crate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to logs where the vulnerable code is being used and TRACE-level logging is enabled. This could be local access to a server or access to centrally managed logs.
