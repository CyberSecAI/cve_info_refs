# AWS SDK for Rust will log AWS credentials when TRACE-level logging is enabled for request sending

## Package

cargo

aws-sigv4
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

0.55.0, 0.54.1, 0.53.1, 0.52.0, 0.51.0, 0.50.0, 0.49.0, 0.48.0, 0.47.0, 0.46.0, 0.15.0, 0.14.0, 0.13.0, 0.12.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.1, 0.9.0, 0.8.0, 0.7.0, 0.6.0, 0.5.2, 0.4.1, 0.3.0, 0.2.0

## Patched versions

0.55.1, 0.54.2, 0.53.2, 0.52.1, 0.51.1, 0.49.1, 0.48.1, 0.47.1, 0.46.1, 0.15.1, 0.14.1, 0.13.1, 0.12.1, 0.11.1, 0.10.2, 0.9.1, 0.8.1, 0.7.1, 0.6.1, 0.5.3, 0.4.2, 0.3.1, 0.2.1

## Description

The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation. When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK, `SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone with access to logs.

### Impact

All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically.

### Patches

* `0.54.2`
* `0.53.2`
* `0.52.1`
* `0.51.1`

* `0.49.1`
* `0.48.1`
* `0.47.1`

* `0.8.1`
* `0.7.1`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
