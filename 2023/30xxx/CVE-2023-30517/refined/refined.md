Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30517:

**CVE-2023-30517**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation when connecting to a configured NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner server.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Disabled SSL/TLS validation**: The plugin does not validate the SSL/TLS certificate or hostname of the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner server.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker can intercept the communication between Jenkins and the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner server. By doing so, the attacker could potentially:
        *   **Gain access to sensitive data**: Capture credentials or other sensitive information being transmitted.
        *   **Manipulate data**: Modify scan results or other data exchanged between the systems.
        *   **Impersonate the server:** Redirect the plugin to a malicious server and potentially compromise the Jenkins system.

*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where an attacker intercepts traffic between Jenkins and the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner server.
    
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the configured NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner server.
    *   The attacker requires a position in the network to perform the MitM attack.
    *   The attacker needs at least "Overall/Read" permission on the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin version 1.22 and earlier.
*   There was no fix available at the time of the advisory publication.
