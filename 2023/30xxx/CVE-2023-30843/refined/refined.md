The provided content is related to CVE-2023-30843.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of users to potentially reverse-engineer hidden field values by using brute-force techniques. This is possible if a user has access to documents containing fields they are not meant to see or interact with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access control on fields within documents.
- Vulnerability to brute-force attacks targeting hidden or inaccessible field data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users can gain unauthorized access to the data of hidden fields, compromising the confidentiality of the information.
- This could lead to full disclosure of sensitive data within a system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks involving crafted requests with `where` clauses targeting hidden fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires a user account with access to some documents within the affected system.
- Attackers need to be able to send brute force style requests, using `where` queries.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.0 of the `payload` npm package.
- The advisory suggests a workaround for systems that cannot be updated, which involves using a `beforeOperation` hook to remove queries attempting to access hidden data.
- Monitoring for brute-force-style requests is also recommended for detection purposes.
- The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 7.4 (High)
- The attack complexity is high, and no privileges or user interaction are needed for the attack. The scope is unchanged, but there is a potential for high confidentiality and integrity impact with no impact on availability.
