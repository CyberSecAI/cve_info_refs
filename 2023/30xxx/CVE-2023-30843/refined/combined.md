# Hidden fields can be leaked on readable collections

GHSA-35jj-vqcf-f2jf
Apr 26, 2023

## Package

npm

payload
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.7.0

## Patched versions

1.7.0

## Description

### Details

If a user has access to documents that contain hidden fields or fields they do not have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those values via brute force.

Affected versions: < 1.7.0

### Workarounds

If you are unable to update, you can write a `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries that attempt to access hidden field data.

### Detecting Compromise

Monitor your instance for brute-force style requests against your instance using `where` queries.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
