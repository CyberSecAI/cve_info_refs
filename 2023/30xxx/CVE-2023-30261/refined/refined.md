  "response": {
    "root_cause": "Unsanitized user input is passed to the `system()` function in `callback_lp.php`, `callback_lp1.php`, and `callback_lp2.php`. An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by adding semicolons to terminate the intended command and append their own.",

      "Unsanitized user input",
      "Use of `system()` function with user-controlled data"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the host. In the default openWB configuration, these commands are executed with root privileges due to the `www-data` user having unconstrained sudo access, allowing full control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to vulnerable PHP files (`callback_lp.php`, `callback_lp1.php`, `callback_lp2.php`)"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the target server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in openWB versions 1.6 and 1.7. The fix involves sanitizing user input using `escapeshellargs()` before passing it to the `system()` function. The issue was initially reported in [snaptec/openWB#2672](https://github.com/snaptec/openWB/issues/2672) and resolved in [snaptec/openWB#2673](https://github.com/snaptec/openWB/pull/2673)"
