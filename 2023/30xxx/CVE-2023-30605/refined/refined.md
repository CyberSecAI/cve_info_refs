The content provided relates to CVE-2023-30605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the unsafe concatenation of user-supplied input with SQL queries in the `param_edit` method of `sql/instance.py`. Specifically, the `variable_name` and `variable_value` parameters are used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection (CWE-89). Multiple instances of this vulnerability exist within the `param_edit` method, impacting different database engine implementations:
   - `sql/engines/goinception.py`'s `set_variable` and `get_variables` methods.
   - `sql/engines/mysql.py`'s `set_variable` and `get_variables` methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Information Disclosure by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the connected databases. This could allow attackers to read sensitive data, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send malicious requests containing crafted SQL injection payloads in the `variable_name` and `variable_value` parameters to the vulnerable `param_edit` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have low privileges to access the `param_edit` endpoint. Knowledge of the instance name defined in Archery is also required for successful exploitation. No user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
