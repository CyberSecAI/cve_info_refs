Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `xkjs_ver32` function of the Tenda AC15 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The function reads a user-provided parameter without performing any length checks before passing it to a stack-based buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or achieve remote code execution (RCE) by sending carefully crafted overflow data in a request.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to the affected page with malicious data. This implies a network-based attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the router. This likely means they need to be on the same network or have some form of access to the router's network interface. The attacker must be able to craft a specific malicious payload to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware version is `US_AC15V1.0BR_V15.03.05.19`.
- The specific function affected is `xkjs_ver32`.
- No specific exploit (PoC) is provided due to legal and policy reasons.
