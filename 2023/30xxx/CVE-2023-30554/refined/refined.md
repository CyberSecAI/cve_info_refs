Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck` method. Specifically, the `db_name` parameter is taken directly from user input and concatenated into an SQL query in the `sql/engines/oracle.py`'s `explain_check` method, without proper escaping or using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries by directly embedding unsanitized user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to database information. By injecting malicious SQL code through the `db_name` parameter, an attacker could read sensitive data, potentially from any database connected to the Archery application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, allowing remote exploitation.
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can send a malicious POST request to the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint, including SQL injection code in the `db_name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges to make the vulnerable request.
- **Knowledge of Instance Name:**  The attacker needs to know the name of the exploited instance as it's defined in Archery. This information is needed to target a specific database.
- **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to the Archery instance.
