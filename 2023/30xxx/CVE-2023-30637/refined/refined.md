The provided content discusses a memory leak issue found in the `braft` project, specifically related to the atomic server example. This issue arises from the usage of `brpc::Server`, a component of the `brpc` library. The memory leak is reported by AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The memory leak occurs within the `brpc::Server::StartInternal` function and during the initialization of `brpc::ServerOptions`. Specifically, the issue is related to memory allocated within `bthread_keytable_pool_init` and not being freed properly when the server starts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Memory is allocated using `operator new` in `brpc::Server::StartInternal`, `brpc::ServerOptions::ServerOptions`, and `bthread_keytable_pool_init` but not properly deallocated.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Uncontrolled consumption of memory, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions due to memory exhaustion. This is particularly concerning in long-running server applications where the leaks will accumulate over time.
    *   Performance degradation due to increased memory usage.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector here is the normal operation of the atomic server using the vulnerable components. An attacker needs to simply run the server to trigger the memory leak.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker doesn't need any specific capabilities or privileged position, as the vulnerability is triggered by normal server operations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is confirmed with `braft v1.1.2` and `brpc 1.11.0`.
*   The memory leak has been observed with varying amounts of leaked memory (56 bytes, 88 bytes) as shown in the different reports.
*   A related issue has been reported in the upstream `apache/brpc` repository ([apache/brpc#2164](https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/2164)), suggesting that the root cause might lie in that library, highlighting the dependency issue.
