Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks within the Square theme for WordPress. Specifically, it's a "broken access control issue" which means there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the absence of sufficient authorization mechanisms, allowing users with lower privileges (like a "subscriber" role) to potentially execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function and the actions that can be performed without the proper authorization, but the report states "an unprivileged user could be able to execute a certain higher privileged action". The impact of the exploitation is considered low severity.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the WordPress website, exploiting the theme's vulnerable functions that lack proper access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, specifically with the "subscriber" role. This is a low privilege role.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Square theme versions 2.0.0 and below.
*   The fix is available in version 2.0.1 and later.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Dave Jong from Patchstack.
