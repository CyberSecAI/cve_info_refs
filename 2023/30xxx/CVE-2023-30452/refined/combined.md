## Summary

The plugin **EasyMind – Mind Maps for Confluence** allows the creation of Mind Maps and Graphics in Confluence that can be shared with other team members. It was possible to embed JavaScript within a Mind Map that would be executed as soon as someone clicked on it.

## Mitigation & Recommendation

The vulnerability has been fixed in **[version 2.15.0](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211267/easymind-mind-maps-for-confluence/version-history)**, although it is not mentioned explicitly which security vulnerabilities were fixed with this patch.

It is recommended to upgrade the plugin to the latest version, which fixes this vulnerability. We confirmed that our initial exploit payload no longer works, however no extensive analysis of the patch was done from our side.

We closely follow the **[OWASP Guidelines](https://pentest.y-security.de/Web%20Security%20Testing%20Guide/2021/07-Input_Validation_Testing/02-Testing_for_Stored_Cross_Site_Scripting/)** when performing penetration tests and we recommend following the **[Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)** to successfully mitigate Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Policy

At Y-Security we take security vulnerabilities seriously and follow a [**responsible disclosure policy**](../../disclosure-policy/index.html). The 90-day disclosure deadline was exceeded and therefore we decided to disclosure the vulnerability after a fix had been released.
