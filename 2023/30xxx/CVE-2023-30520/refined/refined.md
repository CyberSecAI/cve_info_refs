Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30520:

**CVE-2023-30520**

*   **Root Cause:** The Quay.io trigger Plugin does not properly sanitize or validate URL schemes for repository homepage URLs submitted via Quay.io trigger webhooks. Specifically it does not limit the URL schemes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the repository homepage URLs. When these URLs are displayed within the Jenkins interface, the injected scripts execute in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a Jenkins user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credentials theft
    *   Unauthorized actions within Jenkins
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious webhook payload that includes a javascript URL in a repository homepage URL.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when the Jenkins user views the crafted homepage URL in the Jenkins user interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted Quay.io trigger webhook payloads.

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-30520 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Quay.io trigger Plugin. By injecting malicious javascript into the repository homepage URL via a webhook, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
