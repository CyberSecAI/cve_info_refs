# JVNVU#92207133 Printer Driver Packager NX creates driver installation packages without modification detection

## Overview

Printer Driver Packager NX provided by Ricoh Company, Ltd. creates a driver installation package which fails to detect its modification.

## Products Affected

* Printer Driver Packager NX v1.0.02 to v1.1.25

## Description

Printer Driver Packager NX provided by Ricoh Company, Ltd. is a tool to create driver installation packages. A driver installation package is used to install and configure printer drivers on the target PCs.

The installation and configuration of printer drivers require an administrative privilege, and a created driver installation package can bundle administrative credentials in encrypted form enabling non-administrative users to install printer drivers without administrator's help.

The driver installation package, created by the affected version of Printer Driver Packager NX, fails to detect its modification ([CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)) and may spawn an unexpected process with the administrative privilege.

## Impact

If a non-administrative user modifies the driver installation package and runs it on the target PC, an arbitrary program may be executed with the administrative privilege.

## Solution

**Update the software and re-create installation packages**

Update the affected Printer Driver Packager NX to the latest version and re-create driver installation packages, according to the information provided by the developer.

The developer has released Printer Driver Packager NX v1.1.26 that addresses this vulnerability.
