- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability related to SRIOV virtual function support in PowerVM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An attacker with privileged user access to a logical partition with an assigned SRIOV virtual function (VF) can cause a denial of service to VFs assigned to other logical partitions on the same physical server or cause undetected arbitrary data corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service of the VF assigned to other logical partitions or undetected arbitrary data corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with privileged user access to a logical partition with an assigned SRIOV virtual function (VF)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Privileged user access to a logical partition that has an assigned SRIOV virtual function (VF).
