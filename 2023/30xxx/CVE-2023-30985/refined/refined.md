- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists when parsing a specially crafted OBJ file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125). The application reads past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially disclose sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious OBJ file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted OBJ file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges or network access since the attack is local via file parsing.
