Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input within the `TranslationController.php` file when processing filter parameters for SQL queries. Specifically, the "property" key's value within the JSON formatted "filter" POST parameter was directly inserted into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the "property" value, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data, including data from other users or any other data accessible by the application.
- **Data Modification:**  An attacker could modify or delete application data, causing persistent changes.
- **Server Compromise/Denial of Service (in some cases):** The vulnerability could potentially be escalated to compromise the underlying server or execute a denial-of-service attack, depending on the specific database system and privileges available.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP requests to the translation API endpoint.
- **POST Parameter:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious JSON formatted payload within the "filter" POST parameter, specifically manipulating the "property" key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the affected API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API Structure:** The attacker needs to know the required format of the POST parameter (JSON) and the "filter" key structure, including the "property" key.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves using the `$db->quoteIdentifier()` method on the field name within SQL queries.
- The vulnerable code was located in `bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Admin/TranslationController.php`.
- The patch was applied in commit `7e32cc28145274ddfc30fb791012d26c1278bd38`.
- The vulnerability is addressed in version 10.5.21 of `pimcore/pimcore`.
- This vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
