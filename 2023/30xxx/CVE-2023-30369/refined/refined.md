The provided content details a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC15 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `sub_E2F4` function. This function takes user-provided data and passes it to another function without performing any length checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing length checks on user-provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) attack.
- Potential remote code execution (RCE) through crafting specific overflow data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted request to the vulnerable page/function.
- The exact method of sending the request and the vulnerable page is not detailed

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable device (Tenda AC15 router).
- Ability to send crafted requests.
- Understanding of the overflow to potentially achieve RCE

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is US_AC15V1.0BR_V15.03.05.19.
- The affected firmware can be downloaded from the Tenda official website.
- The function `sub_E2F4` is the vulnerable point, and the user-provided parameter is read without proper length check.
- A proof of concept (POC) is not provided due to legal and policy reasons.
