Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-30262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the MIM Concurrent License Server and MIM Local Concurrent License Server. Specifically, the services are vulnerable to crafted RMI (Remote Method Invocation) requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of incoming RMI requests, allowing an attacker to send malicious data that, when deserialized, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server machine where the vulnerable license server is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the machine running the affected MIM Concurrent License Server or MIM Local Concurrent License Server.
*   **Malicious RMI Requests:** Attackers craft malicious RMI requests containing serialized data designed to trigger code execution upon deserialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable MIM service.
*   **Knowledge of RMI and Deserialization:** The attacker needs knowledge of RMI protocols and how to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   MIM Concurrent License Server
    *   MIM Local Concurrent License Server
*   **Affected Versions:** 6.5.0 through 7.0.9
*   **Unaffected Products/Versions:**
    *   Other MIM services are not affected.
    *   Client installations are not affected.
    *   MIM License Server version 7.1.0 and later are not affected.
*   **Patch Availability:** A patch is available in version 7.0.10, and the issue is not present in 7.1.0 or later. A hotfix is available for versions 6.5.x to 6.9.x.
*   **Discovery:** Discovered and reported by security researcher Eric Guillen, in conjunction with The University of Kansas Health System.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary recommendation is to upgrade to a patched version.  Secondary recommendation is to use the provided hotfix.  Temporary measures can include firewall rules to restrict access to the license service and limiting permissions of the service user.
