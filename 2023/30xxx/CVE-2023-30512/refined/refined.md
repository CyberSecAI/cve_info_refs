{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The cfs-csi-node DaemonSet and cfs-csi-controller Deployment used the same service account which had cluster-wide get/list permissions for secrets. This allowed any pod using that service account to list and retrieve any secret within the cluster.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The cfs-csi-node DaemonSet and cfs-csi-controller Deployment shared the 'cfs-csi-service-account' service account which was granted excessive permissions via the 'cfs-csi-cluster-role' and 'cfs-csi-cluster-role-binding', allowing it to 'get' and 'list' all secrets resources in the cluster.",
      "Using a ClusterRoleBinding instead of a RoleBinding for the service account"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user, gaining control of a single worker node, could leverage the DaemonSet's pod to get/list ALL secrets, including the cluster's admin secret, escalating their privileges to cluster administrator level.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromise of a worker node",
      "Leverage the compromised node's access to pods running with the vulnerable service account."

    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Control of at least one worker node within the Kubernetes cluster.",
