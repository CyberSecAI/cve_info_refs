Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `event_id` parameter in the `/php-jms/result_sheet.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input sanitization/validation: The application directly uses the `event_id` parameter in a SQL query without any form of sanitization or validation.
*   Direct SQL query construction: The application uses user-provided data to build the SQL query dynamically, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including table names, column names, and user credentials. As shown in the provided payload, the database name can be leaked using `database()`.
*   Data manipulation: An attacker could also modify or delete data stored in the database.
*   Potential for complete system compromise: In some cases, SQL injection can lead to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is through the `event_id` parameter in the URL of the `/php-jms/result_sheet.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability as the `event_id` parameter is directly accessible without prior login.

**Technical Details**
*   Vulnerable parameter: `event_id`
*   Vulnerable File: `/php-jms/result_sheet.php`
*   Database: `jms_db`

**Payload Example:**
```
/php-jms/result_sheet.php?event_id=-1%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+
```
This payload attempts to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability by using a union-based SQL injection technique. It injects `-1' union select 1,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+` into the `event_id` parameter, causing the database name to be leaked as part of the result of the query.
