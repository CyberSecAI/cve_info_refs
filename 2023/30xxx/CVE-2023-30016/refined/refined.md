The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Judging Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `sub_event_id` parameter of the `/php-jms/sub_event_details_edit.php` script before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (as demonstrated with the `select database()` payload).
    - Data modification.
    - Data deletion.
    - Potential full server takeover if the database user has sufficient privileges, though this is not mentioned in the content.

**Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is exposed via the HTTP GET parameter `sub_event_id` in the `/php-jms/sub_event_details_edit.php` URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No authentication or special privileges are mentioned as necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
