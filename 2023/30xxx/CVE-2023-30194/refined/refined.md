Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30194:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `friends-of-presta.github.io` directly references `CVE-2023-30194` and provides details about a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Static Footer" module for PrestaShop, which aligns with the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `posstaticfooter::getPosCurrentHook()` method of the `posstaticfooter` module. Specifically, the `$name_module` and `$id_module` variables are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
   - Multiple SQL queries are vulnerable, both for unauthenticated users via `ajax.php` and for authenticated administrators.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive information, including customer data, admin credentials, and potentially credit card details (through webskimmer deployment).
   - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, including website content, user information, and system configurations.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain admin access by manipulating the database.
   - **System Hijacking:** Attackers can change SMTP settings to intercept emails.
   - **Webskimmer deployment:** The vulnerability was actively exploited to inject malicious JavaScript code that steals credit card information from the website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via HTTP requests.
   - **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `ajax.php` file in the module's directory.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to have any credentials or privileges to exploit the SQL injection via `ajax.php`.
   - **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, specifically a POST request with a crafted payload.
   - **Knowledge of vulnerable module:** The attacker needs to be aware of the presence of the vulnerable module and its path (`/modules/posstaticfooter/ajax.php`).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present even if the module is not activated.
- The provided proof of concept uses a `sleep` function to demonstrate the successful execution of arbitrary SQL.
- Patches involve using `pSQL()` to sanitize the `name_module` and casting `id_module` as an integer `(int)`.
- The advisory warns about other potential SQL injection points within the module accessible to administrators.
- The advisory also recommends general security practices, such as using the latest PrestaShop version, changing the default database prefix, and using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
