Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the Leo Custom Ajax (leocustomajax) module. Specifically, user-supplied GET parameters (`cat_list`, `pro_info`, `pro_add`, `pro_cdown`, and `pro_color`) are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through multiple parameters in the `leoajax.php` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary SQL commands
- Potentially obtain admin access
- Remove data from the PrestaShop database
- Copy/paste sensitive data from the database to the front end, exposing tokens and admin AJAX scripts.
- Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- Deploy webskimmers to steal credit card information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET requests to the `/modules/leocustomajax/leoajax.php` endpoint.
- The parameters used in the attack are `cat_list`, `pro_info`, `pro_add`, `pro_cdown`, and `pro_color`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs network access to the affected PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the `leocustomajax` module.
- The vulnerability is present even if the module is disabled or uninstalled, requiring full removal or patching.
- The provided patch involves converting the input parameters to integers before using them in SQL queries (`array_map('intval', $listCat)`). This prevents SQL injection by ensuring that only numerical values are passed into the SQL queries.
-  The module is actively used to deploy webskimmers.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
