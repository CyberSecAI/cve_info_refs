# Malicious HTTP requests could close arbitrary opening file descriptors

Moderate

[likebreath](/likebreath)
published
GHSA-g6mw-f26h-4jgp
Apr 19, 2023

## Package

cargo

Cloud Hypervisor
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

v30.0, v31.0

## Patched versions

v30.1, v31.1

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows users to close arbitrary opening file descriptors in the Cloud Hypervisor process via sending malicious HTTP request through the HTTP API socket. As a result, the Cloud Hypervisor process can be easily crashed, causing Deny-of-Service (DoS). This can also be a potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Users require to have the write access to the API socket file to trigger this vulnerability.

Impacted versions of Cloud Hypervisor include upstream main branch, v31.0, and v30.0. The vulnerability was initially detected by our `http_api_fuzzer` via oss-fuzz [1] [2].

### Patches

[#5350](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/5350)

[#5373](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/5373)

### Workarounds

The issue can be mitigated by ensuring the write access to the API socket file is granted to trusted users only.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @likebreath **[likebreath](/likebreath)** commented [Apr 15, 2023](#issue-1669078384)

Preserved FDs are the ones that share the same life-time as its holding

VmConfig instance, such as FDs for creating TAP devices.

Preserved FDs will stay open as long as the holding VmConfig instance is

valid, and will be closed when the holding VmConfig instance is destroyed.

Sorry, something went wrong.
