The provided content is related to CVE-2023-30859.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Triton plugin for Spigot/Bukkit/Paper Minecraft servers, when in `bungeecord` mode, improperly handles incoming plugin messages from players. It does not filter these messages allowing a malicious player to send a specially crafted packet to execute arbitrary commands on the server console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of plugin messaging packets received from players
- Improper handling of the `triton:main` plugin channel allowing the execution of commands by sending specific payload

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the Spigot/Bukkit/Paper server console, granting the attacker administrative privileges.
- Potential for privilege escalation within the Minecraft server and possibly the host machine, especially when combined with other plugins.
- Modification of server translations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious `C17PacketCustomPayload` packet through the `triton:main` plugin channel from a modded Minecraft client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to connect to a vulnerable Minecraft server using a modified client.
- No prior privileges are needed to perform the attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present when the `bungeecord` option is enabled in the plugin's configuration file (`config.yml`).
- The attack involves sending a specific payload packet containing a byte (`2`) and a string representing the command to be executed.
- The vulnerability affects Triton versions >= 3.8.0 and <= 3.8.3, and <= 3.7.4
- Fixed in Triton version 3.8.4 and 3.7.5
- CVSS score is 8.3, with a network attack vector, low complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, changed scope, low confidentiality, low integrity, and low availability.
- CWE-419 is also noted as a weakness.
