- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software allows uploading files without proper validation of the file type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file) and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the file upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the file upload feature of the application.
