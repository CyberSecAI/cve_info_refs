Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that chat poll data was not being properly purged when the chat history was deleted. This means that even after a user deletes their chat history, the poll data associated with that conversation could still be accessed via the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incomplete Data Purging: The primary weakness is the failure to remove poll data when chat histories are deleted. This created an inconsistency between the user's perception of deleted data and the system's actual state.
- Information Exposure: The API allowed access to poll data even after the associated chat history was purged.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: A user who joins a conversation after the chat history has been deleted could access poll data from before their addition to the conversation. This could reveal information from past polls to new participants who weren't intended to see it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as it involves accessing the API to retrieve data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Account: The attacker must be a user who was added to the chat after the chat history was purged and must be authenticated to access the API and have the ability to query the poll data related to the conversation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The issue was fixed by ensuring that poll data is also deleted when the chat history is purged.
- The affected versions are Nextcloud Talk versions >= 15.0.0, and the patched version is 15.0.5.
