Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-30849

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "property" value within the JSON formatted "filter" GET parameter in the Admin Translations Export API.
- This unsanitized value is directly incorporated into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data from the database that they shouldn't have access to, which could include data from other users or any data the application can access.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data, potentially causing persistent changes to the application's behavior or content.
- **Server Compromise:** In some cases, attackers may be able to escalate the SQL injection to compromise the underlying server or backend infrastructure.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could perform a denial-of-service attack by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- The attacker manipulates the JSON formatted "filter" parameter, specifically the "property" key, to include malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to access the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable code is present in the `TranslationController.php` file within the `pimcore/pimcore` repository.
- The fix involves modifying the `getGridFilterCondition` method to use placeholders and parameters in SQL queries, preventing direct injection of user-supplied input.
- The fix also includes catching `SyntaxErrorException` to handle potential errors in SQL queries gracefully.
- The patched version is 10.5.21.
- The vulnerability is located in the Admin Translations Export API.
- The pull request #14968 provides more details on the vulnerability and its fix.
- The affected code is in `bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Admin/TranslationController.php` file.
