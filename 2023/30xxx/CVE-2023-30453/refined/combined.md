Key highlights:

* Create the email-reminders on any issue for yourself and your colleagues (if you are granted the relevant rights). You can create personal or group reminders.
* Manage the reminders you created and the reminders created for you in the convenient section, use a special gadget to browse your upcoming reminders on a dashboard.
* As a Jira Administrator, manage all reminders in one place.
* If you need to do something repeatedly just set the periodicity while creating a reminder.
* Create reminders for parent-child issues in one place: you can set reminders for all subtasks from their parent issue and vice versa. The list of reminders inside the issue helps you not to miss a single one.

## Summary

The Plugin **Reminder for Jira** gives users the ability to create simple reminders for themselves and other users within the same Jira instance. It is possible to embed HTML code directly within a single reminder, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, that can be used to target other users. The victim user simply has to view the reminder and the attackerâ€™s payload will be triggered within the victimâ€™s browser.

**[CVE-2023-30453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-30453)** was assigned for this vulnerability.

## Mitigation & Recommendation

The vulnerability has been fixed in **[version 2.6.6](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217030/reminder-for-jira-follow-up-issues/version-history)**, although it is not mentioned explicitly which security vulnerabilities were fixed with this patch.

It is recommended to upgrade the plugin to the latest version, which fixes this vulnerability. We tested the updated plugin to ensure this vulnerability can no longer be exploited.

We closely follow the **[OWASP Guidelines](https://pentest.y-security.de/Web%20Security%20Testing%20Guide/2021/07-Input_Validation_Testing/02-Testing_for_Stored_Cross_Site_Scripting/)** when performing penetration tests and we recommend following the **[Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)** to successfully mitigate Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Policy

At Y-Security we take security vulnerabilities seriously and follow aÂ [**responsible disclosure policy**](../../disclosure-policy/index.html). The 90-day disclosure deadline was exceeded and therefore we decided to disclosure the vulnerability after a fix had been released.
