Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `posstaticblocks::getPosCurrentHook()` method in the "Static Blocks" (posstaticblocks) module for PrestaShop. This method contains sensitive SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters. Specifically, the `$id_module` and `$id_shop` parameters are directly included in the SQL queries without being properly escaped or casted to an integer. Additionally, the `$name_module` parameter is not escaped using `pSQL` in one of the queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data, such as admin credentials, customer information, and other database contents.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious actors could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can be used to gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Web Skimming:** The vulnerability is actively being exploited to deploy web skimmers to steal credit card information.
*   **Email Hijacking:** Attackers can rewrite SMTP settings to intercept emails.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can sometimes be chained to gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Direct HTTP Call:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `ajax.php` file in the module's directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges on the PrestaShop installation to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to reach the server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge**: Attacker needs to be able to perform basic POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit can be used even if the module is not activated.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The patch involves casting `$id_module` and `$id_shop` to integers and using `pSQL` for the `$name_module` parameter in the SQL queries.
*   The advisory also highlights that there are other SQL injection vulnerabilities within PrestaShop and its modules, but they are ignored to avoid information overload.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest PrestaShop version, which disables multiquery execution but does not fully protect against SQL injection. It also recommends using `pSQL` for proper sanitization.
