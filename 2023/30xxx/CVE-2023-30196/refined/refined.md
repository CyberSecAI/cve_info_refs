Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30196:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The "Sales Booster" module for PrestaShop had a vulnerability due to a lack of proper path sanitization in the `download.php` file. Specifically, it did not properly restrict the path provided in the `file` parameter, allowing for path traversal.
*   The module used a predictable security token mechanism, which, in conjunction with the path traversal, exposed more files than intended.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: The module failed to properly sanitize the file path provided by the user, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Predictable security token:**  The module used a predictable method for generating security tokens.
*   **Insecure file download:** The module was vulnerable to downloading arbitrary files from the server, without proper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality breach**: Attackers could download sensitive files, including:
    *   Admin ajax scripts from modules
    *   Module code (allowing for reverse engineering and finding other vulnerabilities)
    *   `table_prefix` values (allowing for easier SQL injection attacks)
    *   Potentially restricted files such as server logs
*   **Circumvent access controls**: Attackers could bypass WAF (Web Application Firewall) and `.htaccess` restrictions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   The attack involves a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `file` parameter to the `modules/salesbooster/downloads/download.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No special privileges are needed.
*   No user interaction is required
*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered high severity (CVSS score of 7.5) due to the potential for significant information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the module <= 1.10.4 and was fixed in version 1.10.5.
*   The provided patch snippet shows that the fix implemented in 1.10.5 involved using `basename()` to prevent directory traversal and an additional check for `.txt` extension.
*   Even after the patch, the security token mechanism remains predictable.
