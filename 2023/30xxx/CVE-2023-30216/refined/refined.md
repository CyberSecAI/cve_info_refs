The provided content describes a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability in the `newbee-mall` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `updateInfo` function in `ltd.newbee.mall.controller.mall.PersonalController` and the `updateUserInfo` function in `ltd.newbee.mall.service.impl.NewBeeMallUserServiceImpl` allow modification of a user's ID via the `mallUser.getUserId` parameter, which is user-controlled.
*   There is a lack of validation to ensure the user is only modifying their own account, leading to a horizontal privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can modify the `userId` parameter to impersonate another user without needing their password.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system uses user-controlled input (the user ID) to directly access user records without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to other user accounts, viewing and modifying their personal information and orders.
*   The attacker can effectively impersonate other users within the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the `/updateInfo` endpoint.
*   The attacker modifies the `userId` parameter in the request using tools like BurpSuite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of another user to exploit the vulnerability.

The provided information gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including code locations, steps to reproduce, and impact, which is more comprehensive than a typical CVE description.
