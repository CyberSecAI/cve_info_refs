# Critical Easy Digital Downloads Vulnerability

[Security advisories](https://patchstack.com/category/security-advisories/)
[Security Advisory](https://patchstack.com/tag/security-advisory/)
Published 2 May 2023Updated 23 November 2023![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7f009046884a335084f86ff1a1acadce?s=200&d=mm&r=g)[Dave Jong](https://patchstack.com/author/davetheawesome/)CTO at PatchstackTable of Contents

*This security advisory is written about a critical [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) vulnerability originally discovered by [Nguyen Anh Tien](https://twitter.com/vigov5) and reported to us through our [bug bounty program](https://patchstack.com/bug-bounty/). Patchstack users have received a vPatch to protect their site against this vulnerability.*

**Patchstack Pro and Business users are protected from the vulnerability in Easy Digital Downloads. You can also sign up for the [Patchstack Community plan](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) to be notified about vulnerabilities as soon as they become disclosed.**

**For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/) for hosting companies.**

### About the Easy Digital Downloads plugin

The Easy Digital Downloads plugin is described as a plugin that gives you unlimited products with no hidden listing fees, unlimited products, unlimited transactions and provides unlimited possibilities.

![Easy Digital Downloads vulnerability ](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11.png)
### Easy Digital Downloads vulnerability information

On April 21st, 2023, [Nguyen Anh Tien](https://twitter.com/vigov5) reported a [critical vulnerability](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/easy-digital-downloads/wordpress-easy-digital-downloads-plugin-3-1-1-4-1-unauthenticated-privilege-escalation-vulnerability) to us that exists in the [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) plugin versions 3.1.1.4.1 and below. This vulnerability makes it possible for any user, regardless of their current authentication and authorization, to execute any action registered with the prefix *edd\_*.

This prefix is also present in one of the methods that performs a password reset which means it’s possible to reset the password of any user as long as you know their username thus being able to reset the password of the administrator and login on their account. This vulnerability occurs because this password reset function does not validate a password reset key and instead directly changes the password of the given user.

### The patch in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin

This issue occurs because we are able to call any action registered with the edd\_ prefix. The patch can be seen [here](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2906668/easy-digital-downloads/trunk/includes/users/lost-password.php). This shows that the function can no longer be called directly and includes additional validation to make sure that the password reset key is present and legitimate.

# Risks

CVSS 9.8

This vulnerability is highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited.

##### 9.8

### Privilege Escalation

This could allow a malicious actor to escalate their low privileged account to something with higher privileges. After this they could take full control of the website if high privileges are gained.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

We advise to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability immediately.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
