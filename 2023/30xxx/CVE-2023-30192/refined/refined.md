Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-30192:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `id_category` parameter within the `PosSearch::find()` method of the "Search Products" module (possearchproducts) for PrestaShop. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code through a simple HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized parameter being directly used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Critical Impact:** The vulnerability has a critical severity rating of 9.8.
- **Data Breaches:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data, including admin credentials, credit card information, and other confidential information stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can remove or modify data within the PrestaShop database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can obtain admin access.
- **Web Skimming:** The exploit is actively being used to deploy webskimmers to steal credit card information.
- **Email Hijacking:** Attackers can rewrite SMTP settings to take over email communications.
- **Token and Ajax Script Exposure:** Attackers can copy and paste data from sensitive tables to the frontend, exposing tokens and unlocking admin ajax scripts

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
- **HTTP Request:** A simple HTTP request to the vulnerable module is sufficient to trigger the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No privileges are needed.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs network access to the affected PrestaShop instance.
- The module does not need to be active to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**
- A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability using a `curl` command.
- The fix involves casting the `id_category` parameter to an integer: `(int) $id_category`.
- The advisory recommends patching or deleting the module, upgrading PrestaShop, and taking other security measures such as changing the database prefix and activating OWASP rules on a WAF.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a code review and actively exploited before the advisory was published due to lack of response from the module author.
