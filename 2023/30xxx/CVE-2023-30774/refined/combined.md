# heap-buffer-overflow in tiffcrop

# Summary

Hello,I use fuzzer to test tiffcrop and fund heap-buffer-overflow,and the issue is different from issue [#269 (closed)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/269 "Heap buffer overflow in writeCroppedImage, tiffcrop.c:7996"). Because I run [#269 (closed)](/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/269 "Heap buffer overflow in writeCroppedImage, tiffcrop.c:7996")'s poc and didn't trigger the crash.The following is the details.
