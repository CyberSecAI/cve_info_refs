Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `LoginServlet.java` file in the ChatEngine application does not sanitize or escape the `txtMsg` parameter before displaying it in the chat window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because the unsanitized input from the `txtMsg` parameter is stored and later displayed to other users in the chat.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `txtMsg` parameter. When a victim views the chat, the injected script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the chat interface

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker sends a message containing malicious JavaScript code within the `txtMsg` parameter.
*   This malicious message is stored (likely in a database).
*   When a user loads the chat window, the stored message is retrieved and displayed without proper sanitization, causing the malicious JavaScript to be executed within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the chat application and send messages. They don't require elevated privileges within the application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `LoginServlet.java` file, specifically where it processes the `txtMsg` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is present in the ChatEngine version 1.0 and commit `fded8e710ad59f816867ad47d7fc4862f6502f3e`.
*   The vulnerability was reported on 01-04-2023 and made public on 06-07-2023. It was not fixed as of the advisory publication.
