Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-30285 (Note: The content incorrectly references CVE-2023-20256, but the provided description and PoC details match CVE-2023-30285.)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Issue Sync - Synchronization for Jira" plugin, in versions prior to 3.5.2, exposed sensitive information by allowing authenticated users to list all technical users along with their passwords encoded in base64.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of technical user credentials, which are sensitive data that should be protected.
-   **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin failed to implement proper access controls, allowing any authenticated user to retrieve this sensitive information.
-   **Insecure Storage of Passwords:** Storing passwords in base64, while not plain text, is not a secure practice as it's easily reversible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Access to Jira Projects:** The leaked technical user credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to data stored in other projects on JIRA, violating data confidentiality and potentially integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Network Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a GET request to the `/rest/synchronizer/1.0/technicalUser` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Authenticated Jira User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Jira instance. No special administrative or elevated privileges are needed, only basic user authentication to the system is required.
