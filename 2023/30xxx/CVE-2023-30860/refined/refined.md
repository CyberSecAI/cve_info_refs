Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AVideo application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a meeting room schedule. Specifically, the "Meet topic" field allows users to inject malicious scripts.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Meet topic" field. This code is then executed when other users, including administrators, view the meeting schedule. This can lead to:
    * **Cookie hijacking:** The attacker can steal user session cookies.
    * **Account takeover:** By hijacking cookies, an attacker can gain control of any user account, including administrator accounts, without requiring user interaction.
* **Attack vectors:**
    * The attacker needs a valid user account within the AVideo application.
    * The attacker must create a meeting schedule using the 'Meet -> Schedule' function.
    * The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload into the 'Meet Topic' field.
    * The attack is triggered when another user views the meeting schedule created by the attacker, for example, in 'Meet -> Schedule -> Upcoming'.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker requires an account with basic user privileges within AVideo.
    * The attacker does not require any special permissions or specific server access to perform the attack.
    
**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects versions of AVideo prior to 12.4.
* The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-30860.
* The exploit is demonstrated with an XSS payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('Pawned+by+Gonz')>`.
* The attacker is credited as "gonzxph"
