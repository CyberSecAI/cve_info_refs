- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission assignment for the installation folder when a non-default installation path is chosen during the installation of SIMATIC WinCC V7.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the failure of the affected application to set proper access rights for its installation folder when installed in a non-default location. This results in overly permissive access control on the installation folder.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A local attacker can inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated local attacker with the ability to write to the installation folder.
