# Off-by-one error in Antelope DBMS

Low

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-257g-w39m-5jj4
Apr 26, 2023

## Package

Antelope

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management system in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem exists in the Contiki File System (CFS) backend for the storage of data (file os/storage/antelope/storage-cfs.c). In the functions storage\_get\_index and storage\_put\_index, a buffer for merging two strings is allocated with one byte less than the maximum size of the merged strings, causing subsequent function calls to the cfs\_open function to read from memory beyond the buffer size.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be incuded in the next release.

### Workarounds

The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [#2425](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2425).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

Email us at security@contiki-ng.org

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-30546

### Weaknesses

[CWE-125](/advisories?query=cwe%3A125) [CWE-193](/advisories?query=cwe%3A193)

| [@Machiry](https://github.com/Machiry) Yes, it might get a CVE, but it is difficult to exploit the bug without direct access to the DBMS; e.g., by being able to inject shell commands into the IoT node. |

| I agree about the exploitability. But given that this is in a storage stack, it is better to have a CVE (may be a low-severity). |
