Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30541:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract in OpenZeppelin Contracts uses the `ifAdmin` modifier to achieve transparency. When a non-admin address calls the proxy, the call is intended to be forwarded transparently to the implementation contract. However, if a function in the implementation contract has the same selector as a function in the proxy, but with a different signature, the ABI decoder will fail at the proxy level before the `ifAdmin` modifier can redirect the call. This can happen if a function in the implementation has no arguments but the same selector as `upgradeTo(address)` in the proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Selector Collision:** The vulnerability stems from a potential selector clash between functions in the proxy and the implementation contract. If the selectors are the same, but the function signatures are different, the ABI decoding process will fail, preventing the intended call from being forwarded.
- **ABI Decoding Failure:** The proxy attempts to decode calldata based on its own function signatures. If it encounters a selector match with incompatible ABI encoding (e.g., expecting an address when there is no argument), it will revert before reaching the `ifAdmin` modifier and forwarding the call to the implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious developer or user could intentionally create a function in an implementation contract with a selector that clashes with a proxy function and has an incompatible ABI encoding. This would render the clashing function inaccessible, effectively blocking access to that function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious developer or user deploying an implementation contract that contains a function with a selector that clashes with a function in `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`, and having different ABI encoding that causes a revert in the proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deploy a smart contract that will be used as the implementation contract by a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the function selectors used by the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` and craft an incompatible function that has a colliding selector.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in version 4.8.3 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.
- The probability of an accidental clash is considered negligible, however, it can be deliberately caused.
- A workaround exists, which involves crafting calldata in a way that the ABI decoding doesn't fail at the proxy, allowing the function to be properly proxied.
- The fix involved changes in the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract and introduction of `IERC1967` interface.
