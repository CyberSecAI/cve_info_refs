Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30527:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The WSO2 Oauth Plugin stores the WSO2 Oauth client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the global configuration form does not mask the client secret.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Client secret is stored in plain text in the configuration file.
    *   **Lack of Input Masking:** The client secret is displayed in plain text in the configuration form, increasing the potential for exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the client secret, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources protected by WSO2 Oauth.
    *   An attacker who can access the global configuration form can observe and capture the client secret, leading to the same unauthorized access.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Accessing the Jenkins global configuration form, usually through the web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Access to the Jenkins web interface with the privileges required to view the global configuration form.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WSO2 Oauth Plugin version 1.0 and earlier.
*   The advisory mentions that there is no fix available for this plugin as of the publication date.
*   This CVE is related to insecure storage and display of sensitive information, specifically the WSO2 Oauth client secret.
