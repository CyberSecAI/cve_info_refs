{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `CCommandLine::CreateCmdLine` and `CCommandLine::LoadParametersFromFile` functions within `hl.exe`. These functions allocate a fixed-size buffer of 4096 bytes to store command line arguments, but do not perform adequate bounds checking, which allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer if the command line exceeds this limit.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Lack of input validation/bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can achieve code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application (Half-Life). This allows for a local privilege escalation when a higher privileged user launches the game.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation using command-line arguments",
       "Modifying Steam configuration file (localconfig.vdf)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the local system, and be able to modify the localconfig.vdf file for a steam user. This file allows the attacker to specify the command line parameters that will be used when the game is launched. Then the attacker needs to get the target user to launch the application.  "
