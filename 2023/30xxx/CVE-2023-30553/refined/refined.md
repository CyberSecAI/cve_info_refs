- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe user input concatenation with SQL queries. Specifically, the `db_name` and `full_sql` parameters from the `ExecuteCheck` POST method in `sql_api/api_workflow.py` are concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in multiple SQL engine implementations due to unsafe user input being concatenated into SQL queries before execution. This affects Clickhouse, Goinception, and Oracle database engines.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure by querying connected databases.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the `ExecuteCheck` POST method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges and has to send a crafted POST request. They also need knowledge of the instance name defined in Archery to exploit many of the identified SQL injections.
