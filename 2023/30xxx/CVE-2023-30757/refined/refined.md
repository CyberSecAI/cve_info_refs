Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The know-how protection feature in Siemens Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) fails to properly update the encryption of existing program blocks when a project file is updated. This means that older, potentially unprotected versions of the project data remain within the project file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693):** The core issue is that the encryption mechanism designed to protect program blocks is not correctly updated when a project is modified.
*   **Insufficient Data Protection:** Older versions of project data, which might be unencrypted or encrypted with weaker keys, are not removed or re-encrypted when the know-how protection is applied.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who obtains access to the TIA Portal project file can recover previous, potentially unprotected versions of the project, which might contain sensitive information or intellectual property.
*   **Bypass of Know-How Protection:** The know-how protection feature's intended security is bypassed, as an attacker does not need the know-how protection password to access earlier versions of the project data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Access:** An attacker needs access to the TIA Portal project file (.ap[version]). This implies that an attacker has physical access to storage media or network access to location where the project files are stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to Project File:** The attacker needs to have access to the TIA Portal project file.
*   **No Password Needed:** The attacker does not need to know the know-how protection password.

**Affected Products:**

*   Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V14, V15, V15.1, V16, V17, V18, V19, and V20 (All versions affected)

**Mitigations:**

*   **Project Archiving:** Siemens recommends archiving the project. The optimization process during archiving removes older, potentially unprotected project content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Siemens has stated that no fixes are currently planned for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by researchers from the Faculty of Computer Science, Technion Haifa.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.2 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:T/RC:C.
