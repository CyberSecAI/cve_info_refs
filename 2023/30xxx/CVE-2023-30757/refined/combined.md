Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-042050: Know-How Protection Mechanism Failure in TIA Portal

| Publication Date: | 2023-06-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 6.2 |

SUMMARY

The know-how protection feature in Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) does not properly update the encryption of existing program blocks when a project file is updated. This could allow attackers with access to the project file to recover previous - yet unprotected - versions of the project without the knowledge of the know-how protection password.

Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
