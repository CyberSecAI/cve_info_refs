- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe user input is concatenated with SQL queries without proper sanitization. This occurs when the `describe` method in `sql/instance.py` takes user inputs (`tb_name`, `db_name`, and `schema_name`) and uses them directly in SQL queries executed against various database engines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied parameters (`tb_name`, `db_name`, and `schema_name`).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can perform information disclosure by querying the connected databases, potentially accessing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `sql/instance.py` endpoint's `describe` method by manipulating the `tb_name`, `db_name`, or `schema_name` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to have low privileges to interact with the vulnerable endpoint and knowledge of the instance name defined in Archery to exploit most of the identified SQL injection points.
