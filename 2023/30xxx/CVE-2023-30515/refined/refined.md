Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-30515:

**CVE-2023-30515: Improper masking of credentials in Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault plugin, along with other plugins, does not properly mask credentials when they are printed in build logs. This occurs under specific conditions related to pipeline steps and logging settings.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Credential Masking:** The plugin fails to replace credentials with asterisks (`*`) in build logs when using `sh` or `bat` steps within a `node` block on an agent and when push mode for durable task logging is enabled. This mode is enabled either by a hidden option or automatically via other plugins.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive credentials exposed in build logs, such as API keys or passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems, data, or services.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Build Log Inspection:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins build logs can potentially see the unmasked credentials if the described conditions are met.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to Build Logs:** An attacker needs the ability to view build logs within Jenkins where the affected build steps are executed.
    *   **Specific Plugin and Logging Configuration:** The attack requires a combination of affected plugin versions, using pipeline `sh` or `bat` steps on an agent, and push mode for durable task logging to be enabled.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault Plugin version 1.0.0 and earlier
*   **Fix:** As of the advisory publication, there is no fix available for this plugin, but a workaround is available in the Credentials Binding plugin.

**Additional Notes**
The advisory also mentions that:

*   The vulnerability is related to a broader issue impacting multiple plugins.
*   A workaround exists in Credentials Binding 523.525.vb\_72269281873 which applies build log masking, but plugin updates are recommended to fully address the issue.
