{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how ESPv2 handles the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header in conjunction with JWT authentication. When a request with a method not defined in the API service definition includes the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header specifying a valid method, ESPv2 incorrectly bypasses JWT authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to improper handling of HTTP method override.",
      "Lack of consistent authentication checks after method override."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass JWT authentication and access protected resources without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a request with a HTTP method not defined in the API service definition.",
        "Include the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header with a valid HTTP method that is in the API service definition."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ESPv2 endpoint and have knowledge of the API service definition to identify a valid method for the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the requested HTTP method is not part of the API's definition, but the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header contains a valid method. In this scenario, ESPv2 skips the JWT authentication. The issue was addressed by moving the header sanitization to the beginning of the filter chain."
