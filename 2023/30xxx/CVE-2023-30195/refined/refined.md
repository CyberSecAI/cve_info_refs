Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper permission controls in the "Detailed Order" module (lgdetailedorder) for PrestaShop. Specifically, a guest user can access a file that contains customer data without authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor):** The module exposes sensitive customer information, including postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, order history, and purchased products, to unauthorized users.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control mechanisms, allowing guest users to download a JSON file containing sensitive information.
- **Incomplete Patching:** The module's author deleted the vulnerable file, but did not implement an auto-delete feature during updates, leaving older installations vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Private Personal Information:** Unauthorized access and theft of customer data such as addresses, emails, phone numbers, order history, and products bought.
- **GDPR violation:** The exposure of private customer data constitutes a serious violation of GDPR regulations.
- **Legal Responsibility:**  The data leak could lead to legal ramifications for the affected businesses using the vulnerable module.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible through a network request, allowing remote exploitation.
- **Direct URI access:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable JSON file by knowing the correct URL pattern.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any special user account or privileges to exploit this vulnerability, a guest user can access the data.
- **No user interaction required:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during a code review and a CVE ID was requested.
- The module author provided a patch, but it doesn't auto-delete the vulnerable file in previous versions during an update, making manual intervention necessary to mitigate the issue in older installations.
- The advisory recommends either deleting the module, updating it, or restricting access to the specific URI pattern to a whitelist.
