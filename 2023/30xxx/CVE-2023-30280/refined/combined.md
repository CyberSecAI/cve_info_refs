# NETGEAR Product Security

#####

NETGEAR’s mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of our customers by delivering products that are secure and that will protect the privacy and security of our customers’ data. [Learn more](/security/)

We appreciate having security concerns brought to our attention and are constantly monitoring our products to get in front of the latest threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at NETGEAR. NETGEAR strives to keep up-to-date on the latest security developments by working with both security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure world.

To protect users, NETGEAR does not publicly announce security vulnerabilities until fixes are publicly available, nor are the exact details of such vulnerabilities released. Once fixes are available, NETGEAR will announce the vulnerabilities on this page.

##### NETGEAR End of Service

Since continual innovation is the core of NETGEAR’s business, NETGEAR will end service to products three years after their last manufacturing date (or longer where required by law). Once a product has entered End of Service, NETGEAR will no longer provide any new support/maintenance firmware releases, including security updates.

To learn more and to see a list of products that have entered End of Service, click the button below.

##### Report Vulnerabilities

NETGEAR's Product Security Team investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting NETGEAR products and services. If you are a security researcher and believe you have found a security vulnerability in a NETGEAR product or service, please click the button below for our bug bounty program hosted by Bugcrowd:

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
