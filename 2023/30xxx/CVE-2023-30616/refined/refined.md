Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce check in the Form Block WordPress plugin. This lack of verification allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Nonce Verification:** The core issue is the absence of a proper nonce check when processing form submissions, specifically during the `form-block-submit` action.  The code adds a nonce in the javascript code via ajax but it was not verified in the `get_request` function which handles the form submission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF:** An attacker can craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can lead to unintended actions on the WordPress site. This could include submitting form data, potentially altering data or triggering other functionality of the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, allowing for remote exploitation.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers can embed malicious code on external websites that, when visited by an authenticated user, forces the user's browser to send forged requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **User Interaction Required:**  The attack requires user interaction. Specifically, an authenticated user must visit a malicious page/link that will trigger the malicious request to the vulnerable site.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 1.0.2 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, considered as moderate severity.
- The attack complexity is low.
- The scope is unchanged, meaning the vulnerability impacts only the plugin itself.
- There is no impact on confidentiality or availability, however, the integrity of the data being submitted is at high risk.
