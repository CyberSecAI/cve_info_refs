Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30528:

**CVE-2023-30528**

*   **Root Cause:** The WSO2 Oauth Plugin stores the WSO2 Oauth client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the global configuration form does not mask the client secret.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage:** The client secret is stored in plain text in the `config.xml` file.
    *   **Inadequate Masking:** The client secret is not masked in the global configuration form.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the client secret.
    *   Attackers can potentially observe and capture the client secret through the unmasked configuration form.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *  Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
   *  Access to the Jenkins global configuration form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *  An attacker needs to be able to access the global configuration form.

**Summary of CVE-2023-30528:**

The WSO2 Oauth Plugin stores the client secret in plain text and displays it without masking in the configuration form, exposing it to unauthorized access. This vulnerability is classified as low severity because it requires some level of access to the Jenkins system.
