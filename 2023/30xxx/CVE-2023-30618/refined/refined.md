Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

A regression introduced in Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 caused Terraform output values, including sensitive ones, to be printed at the `info` logging level instead of the intended `debug` level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive Terraform output values, which should only be visible in debug logs, were exposed in the standard info logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Secrets:** An attacker or unauthorized user could potentially gain access to sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or other secrets exposed as Terraform output values.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log Access:** An attacker with access to the logs (e.g., terminal output, log files) produced during a `kitchen converge` action could read the exposed sensitive data. This would typically require local access to the machine executing kitchen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to view the logs produced by kitchen-terraform's `kitchen converge` command. This may mean they have local access to the machine running the command.
*   The user needs to be using a version of kitchen-terraform between 7.0.0 and 7.0.1.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 7.0.0, where the logging level for Terraform output was inadvertently changed from `debug` to `info`.
*   The fix was implemented in version 7.0.2, restoring the debug logging level for sensitive outputs.
*   The CVSS score is 3.2, which indicates a low severity.
*   The CVSS vector string is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   The affected versions are 7.0.0 and 7.0.1.
*   The patched version is 7.0.2

This vulnerability allows for local disclosure of sensitive values and is not remotely exploitable.
