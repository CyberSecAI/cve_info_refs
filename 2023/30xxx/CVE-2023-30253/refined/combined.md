Dolibarr is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either Version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version (GPL-3+).

See the [COPYING](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/COPYING) file for a full copy of the license.

## INSTALLING

There is a lot of different solutions to install Dolibarr.

### Using packages

If you have low technical skills and you're looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM with just a few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:

* [DoliWamp for Windows](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Windows_%28DoliWamp%29)
* [DoliDeb for Debian](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Ubuntu_or_Debian)
* DoliRpm for Red Hat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia
* The Docker image (see next chapter)

Releases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).

### Using the generic step by step setup (recommended for IT users)

You can use any web server supporting PHP (Apache, Nginx, ...) and a supported database (MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL) to install the standard version:

* Verify that your installed PHP version is supported [see PHP support](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Releases).
* Uncompress the downloaded .zip archive to copy the `dolibarr/htdocs` directory and all its files inside your web server root or get the files directly from GitHub (recommended if you know git as it makes it easier if you want to upgrade later):

  `git clone https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr -b x.y` (where x.y is the main version like 9.0, 19.0, ...)
* Set up your web server to use `dolibarr/htdocs` as root if your web server does not already define a directory to point to.
* Create an empty `htdocs/conf/conf.php` file and set *write* permissions for your web server user (*write* permission will be removed once install is finished)
* From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page

  The URL will depend on how your web configuration directs to your dolibarr installation. It may look like:

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/`

  or

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/install/`

  or

  `http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/`
* Follow the installer instructions

### Using Docker images

Dolibarr is also available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dolibarr/dolibarr). Installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr-docker).

### Using ready to use SaaS/Cloud offers

If you lack the time to install it yourself, consider exploring commercial 'ready-to-use' Cloud offerings (refer to <https://saas.dolibarr.org>). Keep in mind that this third option comes with associated costs.

## UPGRADING

Dolibarr supports upgrading, usually without the need for any (commercial) support (depending on if you use any commercial extensions). It supports upgrading all the way from any version after 2.8 without breakage. This is unique in the ERP ecosystem and a benefit our users highly appreciate!

Follow these step-by-step instructions to seamlessly upgrade Dolibarr to the latest version:

* At first make a backup of your Dolibarr files & then [see](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Installation_-_Upgrade#Upgrade_Dolibarr)
* Verify that your installed PHP version is supported by the new version [see PHP support](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Releases).
* Overwrite all old files from the 'dolibarr' directory with files provided in the new version's package.
* At your next access, Dolibarr will redirect you to the "install/" page to follow the upgrade process.
   If an `install.lock` file exists to lock any other upgrade process, the application will ask you to remove the file manually (you should find the `install.lock` file in the directory used to store generated and uploaded documents, in most cases, it is the directory called "*documents*").

UNDER ATTACK?
## Security Advisory: Dolibarr 17.0.0 PHP Code Injection (CVE-2023-30253)

       ![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dolibar-injection.png)

*Analysis by Fabiano Golluscio*

**Swascan Offensive Security Team** has identified a vulnerability on **Dolibarr 17.0.0**. The vulnerability can be tracked with id **CVE-2023-30253**.

The vulnerability has been fixed in **Dolibarr 17.0.1**.

## Product description

Dolibarr ERP & CRM is a modular software of business management which adapts to the size of the company (SME, Large companies, Frelancers or associations).

## Technical summary

Swascan’s Offensive Security Team found an important vulnerability on: **17.0.0**

| **Vulnerability** | **Tested Vesions** | **CVSSv3.1** | **CWE-ID** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authenticated PHP Code Injection | 17.0.0 | **8.8** High [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H] | CWE-77 |

In the following section the technical details about this vulnerability, including evidence and a proof-of-concept.

## Description

In Dolibarr 17.0.0 with the CMS Website plugin (core) enabled, an authenticated attacker can obtain remote command execution via php code injection bypassing the application restrictions.

## Proof of Concept

The following POC shows how to run system commands and the test conditions.

The core plugin CMS Websites is enabled and there is a test user with the following authorizations.

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-220.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-220.png)

**Figure 1 – test user permissions**

Actually, the test user can’t modify the website with php code (dynamic php code disabled).

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-221.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-221.png)

**Figure 2 – evidence of the error with php code**

As the Figure 1 shows, the PHP code is flagged as disabled, anyway it’s still possible to inject PHP code as Test user, by tipying “<?**PHP** code…?>” instead of “<?php code..?>”.

The check upon the tag “<?php” can be bypassed by typing it with any character in uppercase (Php, pHp, pHP, PHP).

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222.png)

**Figure 3 – check bypass**

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223.png)

**Figure 4 – php code injected**

The php code has been injected and the page shows the result “4”.

Furthermore, the PHP tag (upper case) also bypass the check on the forbidden php functions in **core/lib/website2.lib.php**.

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-224.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-224.png)

**Figure 5 – file /usr/share/dolibarr/htdocs/core/lib/website2.lib.php**

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-225.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-225.png)

**Figure 6 – php code for RCE**

<?PHP echo system(“whoami”).”<br><br>”.system(“pwd”).”<br><br>”.system(“ip a”);?>

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-226.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-226.png)

**Figure 7 – Remote Command Execution**

In conclusion, with a low privileged user who has access to the websites plugin and **without** the php code permission, it’s poissble to execute command on the remote machine.

## Impact

An authenticated attacker could obtain access to the remote system and execute arbitrary commands.

## Remediation

Download latest Dolibarr release from <https://www.dolibarr.org/>
