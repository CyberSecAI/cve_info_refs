- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An internally discovered vulnerability in PowerVM on IBM Power9 and Power10 systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A violation of the isolation between logical partitions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with privileged user access to a logical partition can perform an undetected violation of the isolation between logical partitions, which could lead to data leakage or the execution of arbitrary code in other logical partitions on the same physical server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with privileged user access to a logical partition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs privileged user access to a logical partition on the affected IBM Power9 or Power10 system.
