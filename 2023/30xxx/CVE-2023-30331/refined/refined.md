Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Beetl template engine, up to the latest version, is susceptible to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). The vulnerability stems from the engine's security manager using a blacklist approach to restrict access to certain Java classes. This blacklist can be circumvented using Java reflection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Blacklist-based security:** The security manager relies on a blacklist to prevent access to potentially dangerous classes like `Runtime`, `Process`, `ProcessBuilder`, and `System`. This approach is inherently weak because it's difficult to foresee all possible dangerous classes and methods.
*   **Java Reflection:** The ability to use Java reflection (`java reflect`) to bypass the blacklist is the core vulnerability, allowing access to restricted resources.
*   **Lack of comprehensive restrictions:** The provided examples demonstrate that even after restricting access to certain classes, attackers can still use other classes or methods to achieve similar results (e.g. using `sun.reflect.misc.ReflectUtil` or `org.beetl.core.fun.ObjectUtil`).
*  **Incomplete Security Manager:** The security manager does not account for cases like `java.lang.Thread` that can be used to create denial-of-service attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by leveraging the SSTI vulnerability. The provided PoC demonstrates this by executing a system command to open a calculator.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the server, including data breaches, malware installation, and further malicious activities.
*  **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by creating a thread that sleeps for a very long time or by stopping threads.
* **File System Manipulation:** File reading, writing and deletion is possible.
* **Network Requests:** Making arbitrary HTTP requests is also a potential risk.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Template injection:** Attackers inject malicious code into the template via user input.
*   **Beetl template engine:** The vulnerability exists within the Beetl template engine itself, specifically in its security manager and handling of user input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to inject template code:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious template code into the Beetl template engine. This is commonly achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications that use Beetl to render user-provided content or by directly interacting with systems that use the template engine.
*   **Understanding of Java Reflection:** The attacker must be able to use Java reflection to bypass the blacklist.
*   **Network access:** The attacker usually needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Beetl application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to execute arbitrary commands.
*   The vulnerability is present even in the latest versions of Beetl.
*   The vulnerability is not considered to be as pervasive as a vulnerability like JSON security issues, since it relies on local java calls that may not be exposed externally in all cases.
*   The content includes a discussion from the developers and researchers around how to best mitigate this vulnerability by restricting java reflection and other dangerous classes, and the difficulty of a comprehensive blacklist approach. They also mention the need for a whitelist approach.
