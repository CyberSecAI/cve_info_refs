# Advisory

###### ID: NFLX-2023-001

###### Title: Insecure random generation in Lemur

###### Release Date: 2023-02-28

###### Severity: Low

###### Credit: kjsman Jinseo Kim

### Overview:

Lemur was using insecure random generation for its example configuration file, as well as for some utilities.

### Impact:

The potentially affected generated items include:

| Configuration item | Config option name (if applicable) | Documentation link (if applicable) | Rotation option | Code reference(s) |

### Description:

If your deployment of Lemur is using any of the above config secrets that were generated by Lemur's example config (i.e., generated using insecure randomness), you should rotate those config secrets. If you generated your config secrets in a more secure way, they are not known to be compromised, but you should still upgrade Lemur to ensure that you receive code fixes for the runtime-generated secrets.

For general information and guidance on Lemur secret configuration, see Lemur's configuration documentation, which includes information on many of the configuration options listed above.

\*For the user passwords: Even though these users are configured to use SSO, they do get generated with valid database passwords that can be used to log in. Since Lemur doesn't have an option to change passwords (#3888), one option for rotating them would be to directly modify the value in the database to some other unguessable string (you do not need to know the plaintext password since it won't be used).

### Workarounds and Fixes

The patch is available in v1.3.2.

No workarounds are available.

If your deployment of Lemur is using any of the above config secrets that were *generated by Lemur's example config* (i.e., generated using insecure randomness), you should rotate those config secrets. If you generated your config secrets in a more secure way, they are not known to be compromised, but you should still upgrade Lemur to ensure that you receive code fixes for the runtime-generated secrets.
