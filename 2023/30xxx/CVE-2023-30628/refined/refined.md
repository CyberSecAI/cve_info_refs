```json
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `changelog.yml` GitHub Actions workflow uses the untrusted `github.head_ref` field directly in a shell command without sanitization, leading to command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the GitHub Actions runner. Since the permissions are not restricted, the attacker gains write access to the repository.",
     "attack_vectors": "By creating a malicious branch name (e.g., `zzz\";echo${IFS}\"hello\";#`), an attacker can manipulate the `github.head_ref` variable and inject commands within the `changelog.yml` workflow.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a branch and submit a pull request to the affected repository. No other special privileges or access are required."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in both the `kiwitcms/Kiwi` and `kiwitcms/enterprise` repositories. The fix involves using an intermediate environment variable to pass the untrusted input, which then mitigates the command injection."
