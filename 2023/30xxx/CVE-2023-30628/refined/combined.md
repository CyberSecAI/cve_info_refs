# Command injection vulnerability in changelog.yml CI workflow

## Package

e39f7e156fdaf6fec09a15ea6f4e8fec8cdbf751

## Description

### Summary

The **changelog.yml** workflow is vulnerable to command injection attacks because of using an untrusted **github.head\_ref** field.

### Details

[Kiwi/.github/workflows/changelog.yml](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/37bfb87696093ce0393160e2725949185cc0651d/.github/workflows/changelog.yml#L18)

Line 18
in
[37bfb87](/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/37bfb87696093ce0393160e2725949185cc0651d)

|  | echo "INFO: source branch is: ${{ github.head\_ref }}" |
| --- | --- |

You can check this blog post for details: <https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/>

### PoC

The **github.head\_ref** value is an attacker-controlled value. Assigning the value to `zzz";echo${IFS}"hello";#` can lead to command injection.

### Impact

Since the permission is not restricted, the attacker has a write-access to the repository.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-30628

### Weaknesses

[CWE-78](/advisories?query=cwe%3A78)
