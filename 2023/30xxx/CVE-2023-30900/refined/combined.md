SUMMARY

Siemens Xpedition Layout Browser consists of a stack overﬂow vulnerability that could be triggered when
the application reads a malicious ﬁle in PCB format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the
affected product, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released an update for Xpedition Layout Browser and recommends to update to the latest
version.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Xpedition Layout Browser is a free tool to view and share of Xpedition PCB Layout Designs and schematic
cross-probe to Xpedition.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-30900

Affected application contains a stack overﬂow vulnerability when parsing a PCB ﬁle. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
