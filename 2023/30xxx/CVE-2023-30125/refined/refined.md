Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation when adding new advertisements in the eyoucms backend. Specifically, the application does not prevent the injection of HTML/CSS code within the "ad content" field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. By injecting a malicious script within the "ad content", an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of users accessing the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stealing Sensitive Information: The injected JavaScript can be used to steal sensitive information from logged-in users, such as session cookies, which can lead to account compromise.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites, modify the content of the page, or perform other actions within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the eyoucms backend and be able to add new ads.
- The attacker injects a malicious payload, such as  `<style onload=alert(document.cookie) />` , into the "ad content" field of a new ad.
- The attacker or any other user will then trigger the XSS by visiting the invocation link of the crafted ad.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least some level of access to the eyoucms backend. They need the privileges to add or modify ads.
- The attacker does not need to be a logged-in administrator. Any backend user with sufficient privileges to add ads could perform this attack, although exploiting other users session may require they are currently logged in.
