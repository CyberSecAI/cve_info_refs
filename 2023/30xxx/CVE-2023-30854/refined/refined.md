{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses the 'exec' function to execute a command constructed from user-controlled input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "OS Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker can manipulate the `cloneSiteURL` parameter through the admin panel clone site feature, which is then used to construct an OS command executed via the `exec` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the admin panel to use the clone site feature."
