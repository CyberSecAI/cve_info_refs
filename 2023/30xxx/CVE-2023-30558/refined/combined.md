## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.9.0

## Patched versions

1.10.0

## Description

## Summary

The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.

## Product

Archery

## Tested Version

[v1.9.0](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/releases/tag/v1.9.0)

## Details

SQL injection exists in the project due to unsafe user input being concatenated with a SQL query, that is passed to methods executing a query in a database. All identified issues exist due to the controller files in folder `sql` taking user input and not sanitizing it, which later is passed to execution. Since the controller methods are connected to and allows querying all the databases that are connected to Archery, then all databases making queries with concatenated input will be affected. In this way, one vulnerable endpoint allows for exploiting several databases. To exploit most of these SQL injections, knowledge of the exploited instance name that is defined in Archery, is needed.

### Issue 5: Multiple SQL injections in `sql/data_dictionary.py` [`table_list`](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L20-L43) method (`GHSL-2022-105`)

User input coming from the [db\_name](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L23) in the [`sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L20-L43) is passed to the below defined methods in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution.

* `sql/engines/mssql.py` > [`get_group_tables_by_db`](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/mssql.py#L56-L78) method passes unsafe user input to `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method on [line 310.](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/mssql.py#L310)
* `sql/engines/oracle.py` > [`get_group_tables_by_db`](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/oracle.py#L170-L179) method concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method on [line 640](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/oracle.py#L640), [line 645](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/oracle.py#L645) and [line 647.](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/engines/oracle.py#L647)

#### Remediation

Escape the variables accepting user input in [`sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L20-L43) method, that is [db\_name](https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L23) by using f.ex. [MySQLdb.escape()](https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/MySQLdb.html#MySQLdb.escape).

#### Impact

All of the issues may lead to `Information Disclosure`.

#### General remediation advice

To fix each of the issues, the best practice would be to escape the user input (as presented in `Remediation` section of each of the issues) or use prepared statements when executing SQL queries. Using placeholders in cursor.execute() will automatically escape the passed values. See [Django documentation around executing custom SQL directly](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/sql/#executing-custom-sql-directly) and [Connections and cursors](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/sql/#connections-and-cursors).

Generally, it is best to use prepared statements rather, but for Archery's codebase it would be much easier to fix the issues by escaping user input, which is sufficient protection. Please consider also escaping all other variables which accept input from the user, particularly the ones from GET or POST requests.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
