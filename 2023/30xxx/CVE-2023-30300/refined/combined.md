Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-ab291ca614
2023-06-26 00:40:45.470173
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : wabt
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 1.0.33
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt>
Summary : The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit
Description :
WABT (we pronounce it "wabbit") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly. These tools
are intended for use in (or for development of) toolchains or other systems that
want to manipulate WebAssembly files. Unlike the WebAssembly spec interpreter
(which is written to be as simple, declarative and "speccy" as possible), they
are written in C/C++ and designed for easier integration into other systems.
Unlike Binaryen these tools do not aim to provide an optimization platform or a
higher-level compiler target; instead they aim for full fidelity and compliance
with the spec (e.g. 1:1 round-trips with no changes to instructions).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Describe the bug Certain `hang.wasm` causes `wasm2c` an infinite loop. `wasm2c` tries to access a memory that is not permitted instead of providing `type mismatch` error for a while.  `wasm2c --version`: 1.0.32 (git~1.0.32-46-g47a589a1)   ---  Content of the file that causes the issue: `vim hang.wasm`:  ``` ^@asm^A^@^@^@^A^G^A`^B{^?^A~^C^B^A^@^@^L^A^H^@^@^@#^@^@^@^@^@^?         ^A^G^Aàÿÿ^O^?^K   ```  `cat hang.wasm`:  ``` asm`{~      # 	???  ```  ---  Steps to reproduce: Here is the file for the bug:  [hang.wasm.txt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/files/11082815/hang.wasm.txt) (Remove .txt extension and save as .wasm)   * Install and build WABT * Run wasm2c on the test file: `wasm2c hang.wasm` * Observe the crash: It will be observed that `wasm2c` cannot finish the execution.   `wasm-validate hang.wasm` output: `Segmentation fault`   `gdb wasm-validate` and subsequent `run hang.wasm` output:  ``` 	Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 	0x000000000047d8c6 in std::vector<wabt::TypeChecker::Label, std::allocator<wabt::TypeChecker::Label> >::_M_realloc_insert<wabt::LabelType&, std::vector<wabt::Type, std::allocator<wabt::Type> > const&, std::vector<wabt::Type, std::allocator<wabt::Type> > const&, unsigned long> (this=this@entry=0x7fffffffdd10, __position=__position@entry=non-dereferenceable iterator for std::vector, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0) at /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../../include/c++/11/bits/stl_vector.h:1762 1762		return (__len < size() || __len > max_size()) ? max_size() : __len;  ```  ---  Expected Behavior: The expected output should be an error like other related tools would provide as below. To cite an example, run `wasm2wat` on the test file: `wasm2wat hang.wasm`:  The output will be:  ``` Expected_Behavior/hang.wasm:0000027: error: type mismatch in implicit return, expected [i64] but got []  ```  ---  Additional information A combination of afl-fuzz++4.03a and Wasmlike, an Xsmith-based random program generator produced the snippet of code that caused the crash. <https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xsmith> |

| I can't replicate the segfault or infinite loop (on GNU/Linux with default ulimit); the wasm2c command runs for 28 seconds, grows its heap to 4.3 GiB, and then spits out:  ``` /tmp/hang.wasm:0000027: error: type mismatch in implicit return, expected [i64] but got []  ```  What OS, compiler, and standard C++ library are you running/compiling this with, and with what stack and memory limits?  I do get similar results (the very long execution) from `wasm2wat --generate-names`, so I don't think this is a wasm2c problem specifically.  I think the root cause here is that:   * this is an invalid module that happens to declare a function with 33,554,400 locals * wasm2c always generates names for everything in the module (before checking the validity), whereas other WABT tools only do so with the `--generate-names` option (and might bomb out on an invalid module before generating names) * GenerateNames takes a long time (and the BindingHash takes a ton of RAM) when there are 33 million locals, because each name is stored in the unordered\_multimap (at apparently an average of ~140 bytes per entry), and each new name is compared for uniqueness against every name already in the BindingHash.   We could probably make this faster with the knowledge that generated names will only conflict with pre-existing names (not other generated names), but not sure if it's worth it. We're still going to be throwing all those names into a BindingHash in the end.  We could also make wasm2c check module validity before running GenerateNames, which at least would improve treatment of these invalid modules. Still would be a lot of RAM consumption for a module that happens to be valid and also has millions of locals in a function. OTOH, if the problem is **just** RAM consumption exceeding a limit, I would expect to get a more graceful failure than a segfault. |

| Thank you for the comment, Professor. Initially, I was thinking it is because wasm2c tries to access unpermitted memory region. Because `wat2wasm` gave immediate `type mismatch` error but `wasm2c` did not. However, after your explanation I also realized that it finishes the execution about 28-30 seconds later that is why the fuzzer sees it as a hang. Considering that time I am inclined to think that validating the input firstly can resolve the issue. Thanks for the explanation.  Ack: Initial title that includes "infinite loop" was not right. The execution finishes after some time.  Best, Khan. |

| Yes, Professor. I checked segfault multiple times and it gave it every time. `wasm-validate hang.wasm` gave segfault. In gdb it gave the one in the report:  ``` Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 	0x000000000047d8c6 in std::vector<wabt::TypeChecker::Label, std::allocator<wabt::TypeChecker::Label> >::_M_realloc_insert<wabt::LabelType&, std::vector<wabt::Type, std::allocator<wabt::Type> > const&, std::vector<wabt::Type, std::allocator<wabt::Type> > const&, unsigned long> (this=this@entry=0x7fffffffdd10, __position=__position@entry=non-dereferenceable iterator for std::vector, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0, __args=@0x7fffffffd8d8: 0) at /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../../include/c++/11/bits/stl_vector.h:1762 1762		return (__len < size() || __len > max_size()) ? max_size() : __len;  ```  `gdb wasm2c` and subsequent `run hang.wasm` output is: (waiting for a while) `rror: type mismatch in implicit return, expected [i64] but got []`  That is one of the reasons, I thought it was memory-related issue. |

| Thanks -- unfortunately I haven't been able to replicate the segfault (with GCC 12 on Ubuntu 22.10) so I'm a little stuck. Are you able to provide a little more information?   1. How are you compiling wabt? `make gcc-debug`? `make gcc-release`? Something else? 2. What operating system is this on? 3. What exact Git commit of wabt is this? 4. Does the segfault still happen when compiled with `make gcc-debug`? 5. Are you able to provide a stack backtrace from gdb? That would help pinpoint better what is going on.   Thanks much! |
