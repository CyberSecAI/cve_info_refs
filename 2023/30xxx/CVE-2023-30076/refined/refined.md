Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `print_judges.php` file within the Judging Management System. The `sub_event_id` parameter, which is passed via a GET request, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application is susceptible to SQL injection because the `sub_event_id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Leakage: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information, such as the database name, table structures, and stored user credentials
- Data Manipulation: A successful SQL injection attack could lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data within the database, potentially disrupting the system's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is accessible through a GET request to the `/php-jms/print_judges.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is `sub_event_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific authentication or privilege is mentioned in the provided text. It is implied that the attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and HTTP requests is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload is: `/php-jms/print_judges.php?print_judges.php=&se_name=&sub_event_id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
- The vulnerable parameter is `sub_event_id`.
- The `updatexml` function is used to extract data from the database by manipulating the XML parsing function of the database.
- The `--+` at the end of the payload is used to comment out the remainder of the original SQL query, preventing syntax errors.
- The application is using a MySQL database.
- The SQL query is vulnerable at the location of the `sub_event_id` parameter.
- The application appears to be running on a PHP environment as suggested by the file extensions.
