### @lentzi90 **[lentzi90](/lentzi90)** commented [Mar 29, 2023](#issue-1645227048) • edited Loading

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

The htpasswd files for Ironic and Inspector contains clear text usernames and hashed passwords so it is better to store them in Secrets.

Depending on how exactly Ironic is deployed this could be a breaking change that requires manual action from the user.

I have tested this with the [deploy.sh](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/tools/deploy.sh) script and confirmed that it is working. Re-deploying Ironic, with the updated kustomization using the script, automatically creates the new Secrets and configures Ironic and Inspector to use them instead of the ConfigMaps.

Note that the ConfigMaps are **not** automatically removed. Ideally, the user should remove the ConfigMaps and change the credentials. The ConfigMaps in question are named `baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd-<random-hash>` and `baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd-<random-hash>` and are located in the `baremetal-operator-system` Namespace by default.

Note that if the credentials are changed, they must also be updated for BMO. This can be done in the same way by re-deploying using the script.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:

Fixes #

## Steps for changing ConfigMap to Secret

Before you start, confirm if the environment is affected or not.

This can be done with the following commands:

```
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic-httpd')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic-inspector')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
```

Affected environments would have `configMapRef`s for the htpasswd files in the output.

If it instead shows `secretRef`s for the htpasswd files it is not affected.

Start by listing the current ConfigMaps and Secrets for reference, so it is easy to check which are new and which are old later.

```
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get secrets > old-secrets.txt
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get configmaps > old-configmaps.txt
```

Generate new credentials and configuration files, for example like this:

```
IRONIC_USERNAME="$(tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 12 | head -n 1)"
IRONIC_PASSWORD="$(tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 12 | head -n 1)"
IRONIC_INSPECTOR_USERNAME="$(tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 12 | head -n 1)"
IRONIC_INSPECTOR_PASSWORD="$(tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 12 | head -n 1)"

echo "IRONIC_HTPASSWD=$(htpasswd -n -b -B "${IRONIC_USERNAME}" "${IRONIC_PASSWORD}")" > ironic-htpasswd
echo "INSPECTOR_HTPASSWD=$(htpasswd -n -b -B "${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_USERNAME}" \
        "${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_PASSWORD}")" > ironic-inspector-htpasswd

cat > ironic-auth-config <<-EOF
[ironic]
auth_type=http_basic
username=${IRONIC_USERNAME}
password=${IRONIC_PASSWORD}
EOF

cat > ironic-inspector-auth-config <<-EOF
[inspector]
auth_type=http_basic
username=${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_USERNAME}
password=${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_PASSWORD}
EOF
```

Create new secrets from htpasswd files, authentication configuration files and credentials for BareMetalOperator.

The exact names of these do not matter and the ones provided here are just examples.

```
# Htpasswd
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd \
  --from-env-file=ironic-htpasswd
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd \
  --from-env-file=ironic-inspector-htpasswd
# Auth config
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic baremetal-operator-ironic-auth-config \
  --from-file=auth-config=ironic-auth-config
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-auth-config \
  --from-file=auth-config=ironic-inspector-auth-config
# BMO credentials
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic ironic-credentials \
  --from-literal=username="${IRONIC_USERNAME}" --from-literal=password="${IRONIC_PASSWORD}"
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system create secret generic ironic-inspector-credentials \
  --from-literal=username="${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_USERNAME}" --from-literal=password="${IRONIC_INSPECTOR_PASSWORD}"
```

Edit the Ironic Deployment to make it use the Secrets instead of the ConfigMaps.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to generate a fool proof patch (for `kubectl patch`) for this, since the `envFrom` field is an array.

It is only possible to replace the whole array or do index based replacements, which cannot really be used without knowing the exact details of the specific environment.

For this reason we only show the steps using `kubectl edit` instead of providing a patch that would likely not work for everyone.

Edit the Deployment with this command: `kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system edit deployment baremetal-operator-ironic`.

Note that the names of the ConfigMaps may differ depending on version and how it was deployed (e.g. the `baremetal-operator-` prefix may not be included in v0.1.2).

The order of the containers and other fields can also differ.

The necessary changes are described here:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baremetal-operator-ironic
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      # Only the containers ironic-httpd, ironic and ironic-inspector need changes
      - name: ironic-httpd
        envFrom:
        # Add the secretRefs like this
        - secretRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd
        - secretRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd
        # Remove these old configMapRefs
        - configMapRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd-<random-hash>
        - configMapRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd-<random-hash>
      - name: ironic
        envFrom:
        # Add the secretRef like this
        - secretRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd
        # Remove the old configMapRef
        - configMapRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd-<random-hash>
      - name: ironic-inspector
        envFrom:
        # Add the secretRef like this
        - secretRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd
        # Remove the old configMapRef
        - configMapRef:
            name: baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd-<random-hash>
      volumes:
      # Change the secret name for the ironic-auth-config and ironic-inspector-auth-config
      # to match what was created earlier.
      - name: ironic-auth-config
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: baremetal-operator-ironic-auth-config
      - name: ironic-inspector-auth-config
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-auth-config

```

Now patch the BareMetalOperator Deployment to make use of the new credentials.

```
cat > patch.yaml <<-EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baremetal-operator-controller-manager
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: ironic-credentials
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: ironic-credentials
      - name: ironic-inspector-credentials
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: ironic-inspector-credentials
EOF
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system patch deployment baremetal-operator-controller-manager --patch-file=patch.yaml
```

Check that the new Pods become `Running` and then delete the old ConfigMaps and Secrets (optional).

```
# Check that the Pods become Running
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get pods
# Delete old ConfigMaps (check old-configmaps.txt if you are unsure)
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete configmap baremetal-operator-ironic-htpasswd-<random-hash>
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete configmap baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-htpasswd-<random-hash>
# Delete old Secrets (check old-secrets.txt if you are unsure)
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete secret baremetal-operator-ironic-auth-config-<random-hash>
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete secret baremetal-operator-ironic-inspector-auth-config-<random-hash>
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete secret ironic-credentials-<random-hash>
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system delete secret ironic-inspector-credentials-<random-hash>
```

Confirm the fix by again checking the output of these commands:

```
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic-httpd')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get deployments.apps baremetal-operator-ironic \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == 'ironic-inspector')].envFrom}{'\n'}"
```

They should now show only `secretRef`s for htpasswd files.

Clean up temporary files:

```
rm patch.yaml
rm old-secrets.txt
rm old-configmaps.txt
shred -u ironic-htpasswd
shred -u ironic-inspector-htpasswd
shred -u ironic-auth-config
shred -u ironic-inspector-auth-config
```

| /hold cancel  I have added manual steps for live environments in the description. It is hard to make something fool proof without making too many assumptions, so it is unfortunately quite general. The users will need to adapt to their specific environments.  Thanks [@lentzi90](https://github.com/lentzi90), the steps are detailed enough and quite OK. Anyone installing BMO should be able to follow those. |

# Ironic and ironic-inspector may expose htpasswd files as ConfigMaps

Moderate

[tuminoid](/tuminoid)
published
GHSA-9wh7-397j-722m
Apr 26, 2023

## Package

baremetal-operator

## Affected versions

< 0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.3.0

## Description

### Impact

Ironic and ironic-inspector deployed within Baremetal Operator using the included `deploy.sh` store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by anyone having a cluster-wide read-access to the management cluster, or access to the management cluster's Etcd storage.

### Patches

This issue is patched in [baremetal-operator PR#1241](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1241), and is included in BMO release 0.3.0 onwards.

### Workarounds

User may modify the kustomizations and redeploy the BMO, or recreate the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per instructions in [baremetal-operator PR#1241](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1241)

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
