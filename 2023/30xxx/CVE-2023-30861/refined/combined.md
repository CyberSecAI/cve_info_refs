# Changes[¶](#changes "Link to this heading")

## Version 3.1.1[¶](#version-3-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Unreleased

* Fix type hint for `cli_runner.invoke`. [#5645](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5645)

## Version 3.1.0[¶](#version-3-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-11-13

* Drop support for Python 3.8. [#5623](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5623)
* Update minimum dependency versions to latest feature releases.
  Werkzeug >= 3.1, ItsDangerous >= 2.2, Blinker >= 1.9. [#5624,5633](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5624%2C5633)
* Provide a configuration option to control automatic option
  responses. [#5496](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5496)
* `Flask.open_resource`/`open_instance_resource` and
  `Blueprint.open_resource` take an `encoding` parameter to use when
  opening in text mode. It defaults to `utf-8`. [#5504](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5504)
* `Request.max_content_length` can be customized per-request instead of only
  through the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` config. Added
  `MAX_FORM_MEMORY_SIZE` and `MAX_FORM_PARTS` config. Added documentation
  about resource limits to the security page. [#5625](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5625)
* Add support for the `Partitioned` cookie attribute (CHIPS), with the
  `SESSION_COOKIE_PARTITIONED` config. [#5472](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5472)
* `-e path` takes precedence over default `.env` and `.flaskenv` files.
  `load_dotenv` loads default files in addition to a path unless
  `load_defaults=False` is passed. [#5628](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5628)
* Support key rotation with the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` config, a list of old
  secret keys that can still be used for unsigning. Extensions will need to
  add support. [#5621](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5621)
* Fix how setting `host_matching=True` or `subdomain_matching=False`
  interacts with `SERVER_NAME`. Setting `SERVER_NAME` no longer restricts
  requests to only that domain. [#5553](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5553)
* `Request.trusted_hosts` is checked during routing, and can be set through
  the `TRUSTED_HOSTS` config. [#5636](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5636)

## Version 3.0.3[¶](#version-3-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-04-07

* The default `hashlib.sha1` may not be available in FIPS builds. Don’t
  access it at import time so the developer has time to change the default.
  [#5448](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5448)
* Don’t initialize the `cli` attribute in the sansio scaffold, but rather in
  the `Flask` concrete class. [#5270](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5270)

## Version 3.0.2[¶](#version-3-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-02-03

* Correct type for `jinja_loader` property. [#5388](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5388)
* Fix error with `--extra-files` and `--exclude-patterns` CLI options.
  [#5391](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5391)

## Version 3.0.1[¶](#version-3-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-01-18

* Correct type for `path` argument to `send_file`. [#5336](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5336)
* Fix a typo in an error message for the `flask run --key` option. [#5344](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5344)
* Session data is untagged without relying on the built-in `json.loads`
  `object_hook`. This allows other JSON providers that don’t implement that.
  [#5381](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5381)
* Address more type findings when using mypy strict mode. [#5383](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5383)

## Version 3.0.0[¶](#version-3-0-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2023-09-30

* Remove previously deprecated code. [#5223](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5223)
* Deprecate the `__version__` attribute. Use feature detection, or
  `importlib.metadata.version("flask")`, instead. [#5230](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5230)
* Restructure the code such that the Flask (app) and Blueprint
  classes have Sans-IO bases. [#5127](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5127)
* Allow self as an argument to url\_for. [#5264](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5264)
* Require Werkzeug >= 3.0.0.

## Version 2.3.3[¶](#version-2-3-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2023-08-21

* Python 3.12 compatibility.
* Require Werkzeug >= 2.3.7.
* Use `flit_core` instead of `setuptools` as build backend.
* Refactor how an app’s root and instance paths are determined. [#5160](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5160)

Released 2023-04-25

* Restore deprecated `from flask import Markup`. [#5084](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5084)

## Version 2.3.0[¶](#version-2-3-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2023-04-25

* Drop support for Python 3.7. [#5072](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5072)
* Update minimum requirements to the latest versions: Werkzeug>=2.3.0, Jinja2>3.1.2,
  itsdangerous>=2.1.2, click>=8.1.3.
* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4995](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4995)

  + The `push` and `pop` methods of the deprecated `_app_ctx_stack` and
    `_request_ctx_stack` objects are removed. `top` still exists to give
    extensions more time to update, but it will be removed.
  + The `FLASK_ENV` environment variable, `ENV` config key, and `app.env`
    property are removed.
  + The `session_cookie_name`, `send_file_max_age_default`, `use_x_sendfile`,
    `propagate_exceptions`, and `templates_auto_reload` properties on `app`
    are removed.
  + The `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`, `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and
    `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` config keys are removed.
  + The `app.before_first_request` and `bp.before_app_first_request` decorators
    are removed.
  + `json_encoder` and `json_decoder` attributes on app and blueprint, and the
    corresponding `json.JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes, are removed.
  + The `json.htmlsafe_dumps` and `htmlsafe_dump` functions are removed.
  + Calling setup methods on blueprints after registration is an error instead of a
    warning. [#4997](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4997)
* Importing `escape` and `Markup` from `flask` is deprecated. Import them
  directly from `markupsafe` instead. [#4996](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4996)
* The `app.got_first_request` property is deprecated. [#4997](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4997)
* The `locked_cached_property` decorator is deprecated. Use a lock inside the
  decorated function if locking is needed. [#4993](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4993)
* Signals are always available. `blinker>=1.6.2` is a required dependency. The
  `signals_available` attribute is deprecated. [#5056](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5056)
* Signals support `async` subscriber functions. [#5049](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5049)
* Remove uses of locks that could cause requests to block each other very briefly.
  [#4993](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4993)
* Use modern packaging metadata with `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.cfg`.
  [#4947](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4947)
* Ensure subdomains are applied with nested blueprints. [#4834](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4834)
* `config.from_file` can use `text=False` to indicate that the parser wants a
  binary file instead. [#4989](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4989)
* If a blueprint is created with an empty name it raises a `ValueError`.
  [#5010](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5010)
* `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` does not fall back to `SERVER_NAME`. The default is not
  to set the domain, which modern browsers interpret as an exact match rather than
  a subdomain match. Warnings about `localhost` and IP addresses are also removed.
  [#5051](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5051)
* The `routes` command shows each rule’s `subdomain` or `host` when domain
  matching is in use. [#5004](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5004)
* Use postponed evaluation of annotations. [#5071](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5071)

## Version 2.2.5[¶](#version-2-2-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2023-05-02

Released 2023-02-15

* Autoescape is enabled by default for `.svg` template files. [#4831](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4831)
* Fix the type of `template_folder` to accept `pathlib.Path`. [#4892](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4892)
* Add `--debug` option to the `flask run` command. [#4777](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4777)

## Version 2.2.2[¶](#version-2-2-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-08-08

* Update Werkzeug dependency to >= 2.2.2. This includes fixes related
  to the new faster router, header parsing, and the development
  server. [#4754](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4754)
* Fix the default value for `app.env` to be `"production"`. This
  attribute remains deprecated. [#4740](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4740)

## Version 2.2.1[¶](#version-2-2-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-08-03

* Setting or accessing `json_encoder` or `json_decoder` raises a
  deprecation warning. [#4732](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4732)

## Version 2.2.0[¶](#version-2-2-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-08-01

* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4667](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4667)

  + Old names for some `send_file` parameters have been removed.
    `download_name` replaces `attachment_filename`, `max_age`
    replaces `cache_timeout`, and `etag` replaces `add_etags`.
    Additionally, `path` replaces `filename` in
    `send_from_directory`.
  + The `RequestContext.g` property returning `AppContext.g` is
    removed.
* Update Werkzeug dependency to >= 2.2.
* The app and request contexts are managed using Python context vars
  directly rather than Werkzeug’s `LocalStack`. This should result
  in better performance and memory use. [#4682](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4682)

  + Extension maintainers, be aware that `_app_ctx_stack.top`
    and `_request_ctx_stack.top` are deprecated. Store data on
    `g` instead using a unique prefix, like
    `g._extension_name_attr`.
* The `FLASK_ENV` environment variable and `app.env` attribute are
  deprecated, removing the distinction between development and debug
  mode. Debug mode should be controlled directly using the `--debug`
  option or `app.run(debug=True)`. [#4714](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4714)
* Some attributes that proxied config keys on `app` are deprecated:
  `session_cookie_name`, `send_file_max_age_default`,
  `use_x_sendfile`, `propagate_exceptions`, and
  `templates_auto_reload`. Use the relevant config keys instead.
  [#4716](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4716)
* Add new customization points to the `Flask` app object for many
  previously global behaviors.

  + `flask.url_for` will call `app.url_for`. [#4568](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4568)
  + `flask.abort` will call `app.aborter`.
    `Flask.aborter_class` and `Flask.make_aborter` can be used
    to customize this aborter. [#4567](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4567)
  + `flask.redirect` will call `app.redirect`. [#4569](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4569)
  + `flask.json` is an instance of `JSONProvider`. A different
    provider can be set to use a different JSON library.
    `flask.jsonify` will call `app.json.response`, other
    functions in `flask.json` will call corresponding functions in
    `app.json`. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* JSON configuration is moved to attributes on the default
  `app.json` provider. `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`,
  `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` are
  deprecated. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* Setting custom `json_encoder` and `json_decoder` classes on the
  app or a blueprint, and the corresponding `json.JSONEncoder` and
  `JSONDecoder` classes, are deprecated. JSON behavior can now be
  overridden using the `app.json` provider interface. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* `json.htmlsafe_dumps` and `json.htmlsafe_dump` are deprecated,
  the function is built-in to Jinja now. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* Refactor `register_error_handler` to consolidate error checking.
  Rewrite some error messages to be more consistent. [#4559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4559)
* Use Blueprint decorators and functions intended for setup after
  registering the blueprint will show a warning. In the next version,
  this will become an error just like the application setup methods.
  [#4571](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4571)
* `before_first_request` is deprecated. Run setup code when creating
  the application instead. [#4605](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4605)
* Added the `View.init_every_request` class attribute. If a view
  subclass sets this to `False`, the view will not create a new
  instance on every request. [#2520](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2520).
* A `flask.cli.FlaskGroup` Click group can be nested as a
  sub-command in a custom CLI. [#3263](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3263)
* Add `--app` and `--debug` options to the `flask` CLI, instead
  of requiring that they are set through environment variables.
  [#2836](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2836)
* Add `--env-file` option to the `flask` CLI. This allows
  specifying a dotenv file to load in addition to `.env` and
  `.flaskenv`. [#3108](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3108)
* It is no longer required to decorate custom CLI commands on
  `app.cli` or `blueprint.cli` with `@with_appcontext`, an app
  context will already be active at that point. [#2410](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2410)
* `SessionInterface.get_expiration_time` uses a timezone-aware
  value. [#4645](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4645)
* View functions can return generators directly instead of wrapping
  them in a `Response`. [#4629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4629)
* Add `stream_template` and `stream_template_string` functions to
  render a template as a stream of pieces. [#4629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4629)
* A new implementation of context preservation during debugging and
  testing. [#4666](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4666)

  + `request`, `g`, and other context-locals point to the
    correct data when running code in the interactive debugger
    console. [#2836](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2836)
  + Teardown functions are always run at the end of the request,
    even if the context is preserved. They are also run after the
    preserved context is popped.
  + `stream_with_context` preserves context separately from a
    `with client` block. It will be cleaned up when
    `response.get_data()` or `response.close()` is called.
* Allow returning a list from a view function, to convert it to a
  JSON response like a dict is. [#4672](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4672)
* When type checking, allow `TypedDict` to be returned from view
  functions. [#4695](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4695)
* Remove the `--eager-loading/--lazy-loading` options from the
  `flask run` command. The app is always eager loaded the first
  time, then lazily loaded in the reloader. The reloader always prints
  errors immediately but continues serving. Remove the internal
  `DispatchingApp` middleware used by the previous implementation.
  [#4715](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4715)

## Version 2.1.3[¶](#version-2-1-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-07-13

* Inline some optional imports that are only used for certain CLI
  commands. [#4606](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4606)
* Relax type annotation for `after_request` functions. [#4600](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4600)
* `instance_path` for namespace packages uses the path closest to
  the imported submodule. [#4610](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4610)
* Clearer error message when `render_template` and
  `render_template_string` are used outside an application context.
  [#4693](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4693)

## Version 2.1.2[¶](#version-2-1-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-04-28

* Fix type annotation for `json.loads`, it accepts str or bytes.
  [#4519](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4519)
* The `--cert` and `--key` options on `flask run` can be given
  in either order. [#4459](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4459)

## Version 2.1.1[¶](#version-2-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Released on 2022-03-30

* Set the minimum required version of importlib\_metadata to 3.6.0,
  which is required on Python < 3.10. [#4502](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4502)

## Version 2.1.0[¶](#version-2-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-03-28

* Drop support for Python 3.6. [#4335](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4335)
* Update Click dependency to >= 8.0. [#4008](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4008)
* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4337](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4337)

  + The CLI does not pass `script_info` to app factory functions.
  + `config.from_json` is replaced by
    `config.from_file(name, load=json.load)`.
  + `json` functions no longer take an `encoding` parameter.
  + `safe_join` is removed, use `werkzeug.utils.safe_join`
    instead.
  + `total_seconds` is removed, use `timedelta.total_seconds`
    instead.
  + The same blueprint cannot be registered with the same name. Use
    `name=` when registering to specify a unique name.
  + The test client’s `as_tuple` parameter is removed. Use
    `response.request.environ` instead. [#4417](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4417)
* Some parameters in `send_file` and `send_from_directory` were
  renamed in 2.0. The deprecation period for the old names is extended
  to 2.2. Be sure to test with deprecation warnings visible.

  + `attachment_filename` is renamed to `download_name`.
  + `cache_timeout` is renamed to `max_age`.
  + `add_etags` is renamed to `etag`.
  + `filename` is renamed to `path`.
* The `RequestContext.g` property is deprecated. Use `g` directly
  or `AppContext.g` instead. [#3898](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3898)
* `copy_current_request_context` can decorate async functions.
  [#4303](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4303)
* The CLI uses `importlib.metadata` instead of `pkg_resources` to
  load command entry points. [#4419](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4419)
* Overriding `FlaskClient.open` will not cause an error on redirect.
  [#3396](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3396)
* Add an `--exclude-patterns` option to the `flask run` CLI
  command to specify patterns that will be ignored by the reloader.
  [#4188](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4188)
* When using lazy loading (the default with the debugger), the Click
  context from the `flask run` command remains available in the
  loader thread. [#4460](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4460)
* Deleting the session cookie uses the `httponly` flag.
  [#4485](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4485)
* Relax typing for `errorhandler` to allow the user to use more
  precise types and decorate the same function multiple times.
  [#4095, 4295, 4297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4095%2C%204295%2C%204297)
* Fix typing for `__exit__` methods for better compatibility with
  `ExitStack`. [#4474](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4474)
* From Werkzeug, for redirect responses the `Location` header URL
  will remain relative, and exclude the scheme and domain, by default.
  [#4496](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4496)
* Add `Config.from_prefixed_env()` to load config values from
  environment variables that start with `FLASK_` or another prefix.
  This parses values as JSON by default, and allows setting keys in
  nested dicts. [#4479](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4479)

## Version 2.0.3[¶](#version-2-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-02-14

* The test client’s `as_tuple` parameter is deprecated and will be
  removed in Werkzeug 2.1. It is now also deprecated in Flask, to be
  removed in Flask 2.1, while remaining compatible with both in
  2.0.x. Use `response.request.environ` instead. [#4341](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4341)
* Fix type annotation for `errorhandler` decorator. [#4295](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4295)
* Revert a change to the CLI that caused it to hide `ImportError`
  tracebacks when importing the application. [#4307](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4307)
* `app.json_encoder` and `json_decoder` are only passed to
  `dumps` and `loads` if they have custom behavior. This improves
  performance, mainly on PyPy. [#4349](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4349)
* Clearer error message when `after_this_request` is used outside a
  request context. [#4333](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4333)

## Version 2.0.2[¶](#version-2-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-10-04

* Fix type annotation for `teardown_*` methods. [#4093](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4093)
* Fix type annotation for `before_request` and `before_app_request`
  decorators. [#4104](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4104)
* Fixed the issue where typing requires template global
  decorators to accept functions with no arguments. [#4098](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4098)
* Support View and MethodView instances with async handlers. [#4112](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4112)
* Enhance typing of `app.errorhandler` decorator. [#4095](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4095)
* Fix registering a blueprint twice with differing names. [#4124](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4124)
* Fix the type of `static_folder` to accept `pathlib.Path`.
  [#4150](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4150)
* `jsonify` handles `decimal.Decimal` by encoding to `str`.
  [#4157](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4157)
* Correctly handle raising deferred errors in CLI lazy loading.
  [#4096](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4096)
* The CLI loader handles `**kwargs` in a `create_app` function.
  [#4170](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4170)
* Fix the order of `before_request` and other callbacks that trigger
  before the view returns. They are called from the app down to the
  closest nested blueprint. [#4229](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4229)

## Version 2.0.1[¶](#version-2-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-21

* Re-add the `filename` parameter in `send_from_directory`. The
  `filename` parameter has been renamed to `path`, the old name
  is deprecated. [#4019](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4019)
* Mark top-level names as exported so type checking understands
  imports in user projects. [#4024](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4024)
* Fix type annotation for `g` and inform mypy that it is a namespace
  object that has arbitrary attributes. [#4020](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4020)
* Fix some types that weren’t available in Python 3.6.0. [#4040](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4040)
* Improve typing for `send_file`, `send_from_directory`, and
  `get_send_file_max_age`. [#4044](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4044), [#4026](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4026)
* Show an error when a blueprint name contains a dot. The `.` has
  special meaning, it is used to separate (nested) blueprint names and
  the endpoint name. [#4041](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4041)
* Combine URL prefixes when nesting blueprints that were created with
  a `url_prefix` value. [#4037](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4037)
* Revert a change to the order that URL matching was done. The
  URL is again matched after the session is loaded, so the session is
  available in custom URL converters. [#4053](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4053)
* Re-add deprecated `Config.from_json`, which was accidentally
  removed early. [#4078](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4078)
* Improve typing for some functions using `Callable` in their type
  signatures, focusing on decorator factories. [#4060](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4060)
* Nested blueprints are registered with their dotted name. This allows
  different blueprints with the same name to be nested at different
  locations. [#4069](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4069)
* `register_blueprint` takes a `name` option to change the
  (pre-dotted) name the blueprint is registered with. This allows the
  same blueprint to be registered multiple times with unique names for
  `url_for`. Registering the same blueprint with the same name
  multiple times is deprecated. [#1091](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1091)
* Improve typing for `stream_with_context`. [#4052](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4052)

## Version 2.0.0[¶](#version-2-0-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-11

* Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.
* Bump minimum versions of other Pallets projects: Werkzeug >= 2,
  Jinja2 >= 3, MarkupSafe >= 2, ItsDangerous >= 2, Click >= 8. Be sure
  to check the change logs for each project. For better compatibility
  with other applications (e.g. Celery) that still require Click 7,
  there is no hard dependency on Click 8 yet, but using Click 7 will
  trigger a DeprecationWarning and Flask 2.1 will depend on Click 8.
* JSON support no longer uses simplejson. To use another JSON module,
  override `app.json_encoder` and `json_decoder`. [#3555](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3555)
* The `encoding` option to JSON functions is deprecated. [#3562](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3562)
* Passing `script_info` to app factory functions is deprecated. This
  was not portable outside the `flask` command. Use
  `click.get_current_context().obj` if it’s needed. [#3552](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3552)
* The CLI shows better error messages when the app failed to load
  when looking up commands. [#2741](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2741)
* Add `SessionInterface.get_cookie_name` to allow setting the
  session cookie name dynamically. [#3369](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3369)
* Add `Config.from_file` to load config using arbitrary file
  loaders, such as `toml.load` or `json.load`.
  `Config.from_json` is deprecated in favor of this. [#3398](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3398)
* The `flask run` command will only defer errors on reload. Errors
  present during the initial call will cause the server to exit with
  the traceback immediately. [#3431](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3431)
* `send_file` raises a `ValueError` when passed an `io` object
  in text mode. Previously, it would respond with 200 OK and an empty
  file. [#3358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3358)
* When using ad-hoc certificates, check for the cryptography library
  instead of PyOpenSSL. [#3492](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3492)
* When specifying a factory function with `FLASK_APP`, keyword
  argument can be passed. [#3553](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3553)
* When loading a `.env` or `.flaskenv` file, the current working
  directory is no longer changed to the location of the file.
  [#3560](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3560)
* When returning a `(response, headers)` tuple from a view, the
  headers replace rather than extend existing headers on the response.
  For example, this allows setting the `Content-Type` for
  `jsonify()`. Use `response.headers.extend()` if extending is
  desired. [#3628](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3628)
* The `Scaffold` class provides a common API for the `Flask` and
  `Blueprint` classes. `Blueprint` information is stored in
  attributes just like `Flask`, rather than opaque lambda functions.
  This is intended to improve consistency and maintainability.
  [#3215](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3215)
* Include `samesite` and `secure` options when removing the
  session cookie. [#3726](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3726)
* Support passing a `pathlib.Path` to `static_folder`. [#3579](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3579)
* `send_file` and `send_from_directory` are wrappers around the
  implementations in `werkzeug.utils`. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* Some `send_file` parameters have been renamed, the old names are
  deprecated. `attachment_filename` is renamed to `download_name`.
  `cache_timeout` is renamed to `max_age`. `add_etags` is
  renamed to `etag`. [#3828, 3883](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828%2C%203883)
* `send_file` passes `download_name` even if
  `as_attachment=False` by using `Content-Disposition: inline`.
  [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* `send_file` sets `conditional=True` and `max_age=None` by
  default. `Cache-Control` is set to `no-cache` if `max_age` is
  not set, otherwise `public`. This tells browsers to validate
  conditional requests instead of using a timed cache. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* `helpers.safe_join` is deprecated. Use
  `werkzeug.utils.safe_join` instead. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* The request context does route matching before opening the session.
  This could allow a session interface to change behavior based on
  `request.endpoint`. [#3776](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3776)
* Use Jinja’s implementation of the `|tojson` filter. [#3881](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3881)
* Add route decorators for common HTTP methods. For example,
  `@app.post("/login")` is a shortcut for
  `@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])`. [#3907](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3907)
* Support async views, error handlers, before and after request, and
  teardown functions. [#3412](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3412)
* Support nesting blueprints. [#593, 1548](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/593%2C%201548), [#3923](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3923)
* Set the default encoding to “UTF-8” when loading `.env` and
  `.flaskenv` files to allow to use non-ASCII characters. [#3931](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3931)
* `flask shell` sets up tab and history completion like the default
  `python` shell if `readline` is installed. [#3941](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3941)
* `helpers.total_seconds()` is deprecated. Use
  `timedelta.total_seconds()` instead. [#3962](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3962)
* Add type hinting. [#3973](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3973).

## Version 1.1.4[¶](#version-1-1-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-13

* Update `static_folder` to use `_compat.fspath` instead of
  `os.fspath` to continue supporting Python < 3.6 [#4050](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4050)

## Version 1.1.3[¶](#version-1-1-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-13

* Set maximum versions of Werkzeug, Jinja, Click, and ItsDangerous.
  [#4043](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4043)
* Re-add support for passing a `pathlib.Path` for `static_folder`.
  [#3579](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3579)

## Version 1.1.2[¶](#version-1-1-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2020-04-03

* Work around an issue when running the `flask` command with an
  external debugger on Windows. [#3297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3297)
* The static route will not catch all URLs if the `Flask`
  `static_folder` argument ends with a slash. [#3452](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3452)

## Version 1.1.1[¶](#version-1-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-08

* The `flask.json_available` flag was added back for compatibility
  with some extensions. It will raise a deprecation warning when used,
  and will be removed in version 2.0.0. [#3288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3288)

## Version 1.1.0[¶](#version-1-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-04

* Bump minimum Werkzeug version to >= 0.15.
* Drop support for Python 3.4.
* Error handlers for `InternalServerError` or `500` will always be
  passed an instance of `InternalServerError`. If they are invoked
  due to an unhandled exception, that original exception is now
  available as `e.original_exception` rather than being passed
  directly to the handler. The same is true if the handler is for the
  base `HTTPException`. This makes error handler behavior more
  consistent. [#3266](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3266)

  + `Flask.finalize_request` is called for all unhandled
    exceptions even if there is no `500` error handler.
* `Flask.logger` takes the same name as `Flask.name` (the value
  passed as `Flask(import_name)`. This reverts 1.0’s behavior of
  always logging to `"flask.app"`, in order to support multiple apps
  in the same process. A warning will be shown if old configuration is
  detected that needs to be moved. [#2866](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2866)
* `RequestContext.copy` includes the current session object in the
  request context copy. This prevents `session` pointing to an
  out-of-date object. [#2935](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2935)
* Using built-in RequestContext, unprintable Unicode characters in
  Host header will result in a HTTP 400 response and not HTTP 500 as
  previously. [#2994](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2994)
* `send_file` supports `PathLike` objects as described in
  [**PEP 519**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0519/), to support `pathlib` in Python 3. [#3059](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3059)
* `send_file` supports `BytesIO` partial content.
  [#2957](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2957)
* `open_resource` accepts the “rt” file mode. This still does the
  same thing as “r”. [#3163](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3163)
* The `MethodView.methods` attribute set in a base class is used by
  subclasses. [#3138](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3138)
* `Flask.jinja_options` is a `dict` instead of an
  `ImmutableDict` to allow easier configuration. Changes must still
  be made before creating the environment. [#3190](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3190)
* Flask’s `JSONMixin` for the request and response wrappers was
  moved into Werkzeug. Use Werkzeug’s version with Flask-specific
  support. This bumps the Werkzeug dependency to >= 0.15.
  [#3125](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3125)
* The `flask` command entry point is simplified to take advantage
  of Werkzeug 0.15’s better reloader support. This bumps the Werkzeug
  dependency to >= 0.15. [#3022](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3022)
* Support `static_url_path` that ends with a forward slash.
  [#3134](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3134)
* Support empty `static_folder` without requiring setting an empty
  `static_url_path` as well. [#3124](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3124)
* `jsonify` supports `dataclass` objects. [#3195](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3195)
* Allow customizing the `Flask.url_map_class` used for routing.
  [#3069](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3069)
* The development server port can be set to 0, which tells the OS to
  pick an available port. [#2926](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2926)
* The return value from `cli.load_dotenv` is more consistent with
  the documentation. It will return `False` if python-dotenv is not
  installed, or if the given path isn’t a file. [#2937](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2937)
* Signaling support has a stub for the `connect_via` method when
  the Blinker library is not installed. [#3208](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3208)
* Add an `--extra-files` option to the `flask run` CLI command to
  specify extra files that will trigger the reloader on change.
  [#2897](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2897)
* Allow returning a dictionary from a view function. Similar to how
  returning a string will produce a `text/html` response, returning
  a dict will call `jsonify` to produce a `application/json`
  response. [#3111](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3111)
* Blueprints have a `cli` Click group like `app.cli`. CLI commands
  registered with a blueprint will be available as a group under the
  `flask` command. [#1357](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1357).
* When using the test client as a context manager (`with client:`),
  all preserved request contexts are popped when the block exits,
  ensuring nested contexts are cleaned up correctly. [#3157](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3157)
* Show a better error message when the view return type is not
  supported. [#3214](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3214)
* `flask.testing.make_test_environ_builder()` has been deprecated in
  favour of a new class `flask.testing.EnvironBuilder`. [#3232](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3232)
* The `flask run` command no longer fails if Python is not built
  with SSL support. Using the `--cert` option will show an
  appropriate error message. [#3211](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3211)
* URL matching now occurs after the request context is pushed, rather
  than when it’s created. This allows custom URL converters to access
  the app and request contexts, such as to query a database for an id.
  [#3088](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3088)

## Version 1.0.4[¶](#version-1-0-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-04

* The key information for `BadRequestKeyError` is no longer cleared
  outside debug mode, so error handlers can still access it. This
  requires upgrading to Werkzeug 0.15.5. [#3249](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3249)
* `send_file` url quotes the “:” and “/” characters for more
  compatible UTF-8 filename support in some browsers. [#3074](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3074)
* Fixes for [**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) import loaders and pytest 5.x. [#3275](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3275)
* Show message about dotenv on stderr instead of stdout. [#3285](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3285)

## Version 1.0.3[¶](#version-1-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-05-17

* `send_file` encodes filenames as ASCII instead of Latin-1
  (ISO-8859-1). This fixes compatibility with Gunicorn, which is
  stricter about header encodings than [**PEP 3333**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/). [#2766](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2766)
* Allow custom CLIs using `FlaskGroup` to set the debug flag without
  it always being overwritten based on environment variables.
  [#2765](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2765)
* `flask --version` outputs Werkzeug’s version and simplifies the
  Python version. [#2825](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2825)
* `send_file` handles an `attachment_filename` that is a native
  Python 2 string (bytes) with UTF-8 coded bytes. [#2933](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2933)
* A catch-all error handler registered for `HTTPException` will not
  handle `RoutingException`, which is used internally during
  routing. This fixes the unexpected behavior that had been introduced
  in 1.0. [#2986](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2986)
* Passing the `json` argument to `app.test_client` does not
  push/pop an extra app context. [#2900](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2900)

## Version 1.0.2[¶](#version-1-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-05-02

* Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
  a blueprint prefix and route. [#2748](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748)
* Fix error with `flask routes` command when there are no routes.
  [#2751](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751)

## Version 1.0.1[¶](#version-1-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-04-29

* Fix registering partials (with no `__name__`) as view functions.
  [#2730](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730)
* Don’t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
  Only tuples are interpreted as response data. [#2736](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2736)
* Extra slashes between a blueprint’s `url_prefix` and a route URL
  are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
  change in 1.0. [#2731](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2731), [#2742](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742)
* Only trap `BadRequestKeyError` errors in debug mode, not all
  `BadRequest` errors. This allows `abort(400)` to continue
  working as expected. [#2735](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2735)
* The `FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV` environment variable can be set to `1`
  to skip automatically loading dotenv files. [#2722](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722)

## Version 1.0[¶](#version-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-04-26

* Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.
* Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
  Werkzeug >= 0.14, Jinja >= 2.10, itsdangerous >= 0.24, Click >= 5.1.
  [#2586](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2586)
* Skip `app.run` when a Flask application is run from the command
  line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing to debug.
* Change the default for `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
  `False`. `~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by default,
  and an indented format in debug mode. [#2193](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2193)
* `Flask.__init__` accepts the `host_matching` argument and sets
  it on `Flask.url_map`. [#1559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1559)
* `Flask.__init__` accepts the `static_host` argument and passes
  it as the `host` argument when defining the static route.
  [#1559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1559)
* `send_file` supports Unicode in `attachment_filename`.
  [#2223](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2223)
* Pass `_scheme` argument from `url_for` to
  `Flask.handle_url_build_error`. [#2017](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2017)
* `Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the `provide_automatic_options`
  argument to disable adding the `OPTIONS` method. [#1489](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1489)
* `MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from base classes.
  [#1936](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1936)
* Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
  request are handled by the app’s error handlers. [#2254](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2254)
* Blueprints gained `Blueprint.json_encoder` and
  `Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app’s
  encoder and decoder. [#1898](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1898)
* `Flask.make_response` raises `TypeError` instead of
  `ValueError` for bad response types. The error messages have been
  improved to describe why the type is invalid. [#2256](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2256)
* Add `routes` CLI command to output routes registered on the
  application. [#2259](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2259)
* Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
  address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
  Chrome. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is set if it is detected through
  `SERVER_NAME`. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called `create_app` or
  `make_app` from `FLASK_APP`. [#2297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2297)
* Factory functions are not required to take a `script_info`
  parameter to work with the `flask` command. If they take a single
  parameter or a parameter named `script_info`, the `ScriptInfo`
  object will be passed. [#2319](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2319)
* `FLASK_APP` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
  needed, for example `FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app('dev')`.
  [#2326](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2326)
* `FLASK_APP` can point to local packages that are not installed in
  editable mode, although `pip install -e` is still preferred.
  [#2414](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2414)
* The `View` class attribute
  `View.provide_automatic_options` is set in `View.as_view`, to be
  detected by `Flask.add_url_rule`. [#2316](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2316)
* Error handling will try handlers registered for `blueprint, code`,
  `app, code`, `blueprint, exception`, `app, exception`.
  [#2314](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2314)
* `Cookie` is added to the response’s `Vary` header if the session
  is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). [#2288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2288)
* `Flask.test_request_context` accepts `subdomain` and
  `url_scheme` arguments for use when building the base URL.
  [#1621](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1621)
* Set `APPLICATION_ROOT` to `'/'` by default. This was already the
  implicit default when it was set to `None`.
* `TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
  `BadRequestKeyError` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
  instead of the generic bad request message. [#2348](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2348)
* Allow registering new tags with `TaggedJSONSerializer` to support
  storing other types in the session cookie. [#2352](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2352)
* Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
  context stack yet. This allows `stream_with_context` generators to
  access the same session that the containing view uses. [#2354](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2354)
* Add `json` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
  This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
  content type. [#2358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2358)
* Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the `Request` and
  `Response` classes. This adds the `Response.is_json` and
  `Response.get_json` methods to the response to make testing JSON
  response much easier. [#2358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2358)
* Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
  for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
  explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
  MRO. [#2362](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2362)
* Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. [#2374](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2374)
* Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even if
  `Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. [#2373](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2373)
* The following old deprecated code was removed. [#2385](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2385)

  + `flask.ext` - import extensions directly by their name instead
    of through the `flask.ext` namespace. For example,
    `import flask.ext.sqlalchemy` becomes
    `import flask_sqlalchemy`.
  + `Flask.init_jinja_globals` - extend
    `Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
  + `Flask.error_handlers` - tracked by
    `Flask.error_handler_spec`, use `Flask.errorhandler`
    to register handlers.
  + `Flask.request_globals_class` - use
    `Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
  + `Flask.static_path` - use `Flask.static_url_path` instead.
  + `Request.module` - use `Request.blueprint` instead.
* The `Request.json` property is no longer deprecated. [#1421](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1421)
* Support passing a `EnvironBuilder` or `dict` to
  `test_client.open`. [#2412](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2412)
* The `flask` command and `Flask.run` will load environment
  variables from `.env` and `.flaskenv` files if python-dotenv is
  installed. [#2416](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2416)
* When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
  used instead of `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. [#2430](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2430)
* `Flask.logger` has been simplified. `LOGGER_NAME` and
  `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` config was removed. The logger is always
  named `flask.app`. The level is only set on first access, it
  doesn’t check `Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is used,
  not different ones depending on `Flask.debug`. No handlers are
  removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are already
  configured. [#2436](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2436)
* Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. [#2450](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2450)
* Fix a `ValueError` caused by invalid `Range` requests in some
  cases. [#2526](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2526)
* The development server uses threads by default. [#2529](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2529)
* Loading config files with `silent=True` will ignore `ENOTDIR`
  errors. [#2581](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2581)
* Pass `--cert` and `--key` options to `flask run` to run the
  development server over HTTPS. [#2606](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2606)
* Added `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the `SameSite`
  attribute on the session cookie. [#2607](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2607)
* Added `Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner that can
  invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. [#2636](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2636)
* Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
  `SERVER_NAME` does not implicitly enable it. It can be enabled by
  passing `subdomain_matching=True` to the `Flask` constructor.
  [#2635](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2635)
* A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
  `url_prefix` when it is registered with the app. [#2629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2629)
* `Request.get_json` doesn’t cache the result if parsing fails when
  `silent` is true. [#2651](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2651)
* `Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings. Incoming
  JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per [**RFC 8259**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259.html), but Flask will
  autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. [#2691](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2691)
* Added `MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and `Response.max_cookie_size` to
  control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
  ignore. [#2693](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2693)
* Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
  windows. [#2709](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2709)
* Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
  structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

  for `app.run`. [#2109](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2109), [#2152](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2152)
* Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`,
  in the event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt`
  is raised in a request handler.

## Version 0.12[¶](#version-0-12 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-12-21, codename Punsch

* The cli command now responds to `--version`.
* Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in
  `send_file` has been removed. [#104](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/104), :pr`1849`

## Version 0.11.1[¶](#version-0-11-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-06-07

* Fixed a bug that prevented `FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py` from
  working. [#1872](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1872)

## Version 0.11[¶](#version-0-11 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-05-29, codename Absinthe

* Added support to serializing top-level arrays to `jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers.
* Added before\_render\_template signal.
* Added `**kwargs` to `Flask.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  `Flask.test_client_class`.
* Added `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior. If set to `True` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  `False` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
* Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
* Added support for returning tuples in the form `(response,
  headers)` from a view function.
* Added `Config.from_json`.
* Added `Flask.config_class`.
* Added `Config.get_namespace`.
* Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug
  mode. This can be configured with the new `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`
  config key.
* Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3’s namespace
  loader.
* Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3’s
  namespace packages.
* Added `flask` and the `flask.cli` module to start the
  local debug server through the click CLI system. This is recommended
  over the old `flask.run()` method as it works faster and more
  reliable due to a different design and also replaces
  `Flask-Script`.
* Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in `werkzeug.exceptions`). This makes it possible for
  an extension author to create exceptions that will by default result
  in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with a custom
  error handler if desired.
* Added `Config.from_mapping`.
* Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled. The log
  format is now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled
  through the `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` configuration key.
* Removed deprecated module functionality.
* Added the `EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING` config flag which when
  enabled will instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.
  This should help users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
* Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for
  template loading.
* Ported test suite to py.test.
* Deprecated `request.json` in favour of `request.get_json()`.
* Add “pretty” and “compressed” separators definitions in jsonify()
  method. Reduces JSON response size when
  `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False` by removing unnecessary white
  space included by default after separators.
* JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because
  it is a convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some
  clients don’t deal well when this newline is missing. [#1262](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262)
* The automatically provided `OPTIONS` method is now correctly
  disabled if the user registered an overriding rule with the
  lowercase-version `options`. [#1288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1288)
* `flask.json.jsonify` now supports the `datetime.date` type.
  [#1326](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1326)
* Don’t leak exception info of already caught exceptions to context
  teardown handlers. [#1393](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1393)
* Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses. [#1422](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1422)
* Updated extension dev guidelines.
* `flask.g` now has `pop()` and `setdefault` methods.
* Turn on autoescape for `flask.templating.render_template_string`
  by default. [#1515](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1515)
* `flask.ext` is now deprecated. [#1484](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1484)
* `send_from_directory` now raises BadRequest if the filename is
  invalid on the server OS. [#1763](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1763)
* Added the `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE` configuration variable. [#1728](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1728)
* Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad
  application contexts lingering around.
* Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
* Raise an `AttributeError` in `helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import
  hook is used without an `is_package()` method.
* Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request
  or app context to be passed to teardown handlers.
* Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests
  in the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
* Made `@before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
* Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
* Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root
  path correctly.
* Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag
  after invoking. This will allow some uses that are potentially
  dangerous but should probably be permitted.
* Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from
  `app.url_build_error_handlers` reraises the `BuildError`.

## Version 0.10.1[¶](#version-0-10-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-06-14

* Fixed an issue where `|tojson` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes. Now it’s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes. This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
* Added support for byte strings back to the session system. This
  broke compatibility with the common case of people putting binary
  data for token verification into the session.
* Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same
  endpoint would trigger an exception incorrectly.

## Version 0.10[¶](#version-0-10 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-06-13, codename Limoncello

* Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.
* Added `template_test` methods in addition to the already existing
  `template_filter` method family.
* Added `template_global` methods in addition to the already
  existing `template_filter` method family.
* Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
* `tojson` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5
  parsers.
* `tojson` used in templates is now safe by default. This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
* Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new
  function on an already used endpoint.
* Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default
  serialization of datetime objects. This allows much easier
  customization of how JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask
  extension.
* Removed deprecated internal `flask.session` module alias. Use
  `flask.sessions` instead to get the session module. This is not to
  be confused with `flask.session` the session proxy.
* Templates can now be rendered without request context. The behavior
  is slightly different as the `request`, `session` and `g`
  objects will not be available and blueprint’s context processors are
  not called.
* The config object is now available to the template as a real global
  and not through a context processor which makes it available even in
  imported templates by default.
* Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should
  result in less bytes being transmitted over the network. It’s
  disabled by default to not cause confusion with existing libraries
  that might expect `flask.json.dumps` to return bytes by default.
* `flask.g` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
* `flask.g` now gained a `get()` method for not erroring out on
  non existing items.
* `flask.g` now can be used with the `in` operator to see what’s
  defined and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
* `flask.Flask.request_globals_class` got renamed to
  `flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` which is a better name to what
  it does since 0.10.
* `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to
  the template context which makes them available in imported
  templates. One has to be very careful with those though because
  usage outside of macros might cause caching.
* Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
* Added a workaround for chrome’s cookies in localhost not working as
  intended with domain names.
* Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
* Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
* Added support for copying of request contexts for better working
  with greenlets.
* Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses. If you were relying
  on them you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially. Using
  them however is strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
* Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to
  prepare for Python 3.3 port.
* Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions. This
  is now more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway
  through the error handling process.
* Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
* Added the `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` configuration variable.
* Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due
  to different hash seeds between different workers.
* Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
* The builtin run method now takes the `SERVER_NAME` into account
  when picking the default port to run on.
* Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.

## Version 0.9[¶](#version-0-9 "Link to this heading")

Released 2012-07-01, codename Campari

* The `Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
* The `url_for` function now can generate anchors to the generated
  links.
* The `url_for` function now can also explicitly generate URL rules
  specific to a given HTTP method.
* Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
* Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request. This means that
  environ `werkzeug.request` will be `None` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
* Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after request
  callback.
* The `Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name if
  it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build
  Flask instances programmatically. The Flask class will fall back to
  using import on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App
  Engine, or when the import name is inside a zip archive (usually an
  egg) prior to Python 2.7.
* Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters
  application wide, `Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
* The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for
  adding custom template filters application wide,
  `Flask.add_template_filter` and
  `Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
* The `get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a `category_filter`
  argument.
* The `Flask.run` method now accepts `None` for `host` and
  `port` arguments, using default values when `None`. This allows
  for calling run using configuration values, e.g.
  `app.run(app.config.get('MYHOST'), app.config.get('MYPORT'))`,
  with proper behavior whether or not a config file is provided.
* The `render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name. Previously, it only
  accepted a single template name. On an iterable, the first template
  found is rendered.
* Added `Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the request
  context but only provides access to the current application. This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request
  context.
* View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being
  an instance of `Response`. This allows for returning
  `jsonify(error="error msg"), 400` from a view function.
* `Flask` and `Blueprint` now provide a `get_send_file_max_age`
  hook for subclasses to override behavior of serving static files
  from Flask when using `Flask.send_static_file` (used for the
  default static file handler) and `helpers.send_file`. This hook is
  provided a filename, which for example allows changing cache
  controls by file extension. The default max-age for `send_file`
  and static files can be configured through a new
  `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` configuration variable, which is used
  in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
* Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break
  message flashing on sessions implementations which use external
  storage.
* Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions. They are
  no longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined
  meaning.
* Added `Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the `g` instance of each request.
* Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add
  methods on registration.
* Added `flask.after_this_request`.
* Added `flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.

## Version 0.8.1[¶](#version-0-8-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2012-07-01

* Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5. It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.

## Version 0.8[¶](#version-0-8 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-09-29, codename Rakija

* Refactored session support into a session interface so that the
  implementation of the sessions can be changed without having to
  override the Flask class.
* Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
* View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic OPTIONS
  implementation.
* HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that
  they show up normally in the traceback.
* Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries
  to warn you about them.
* Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a
  view was attached after the first request was handled. This gives
  earlier feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of
  time.
* Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once
  at the beginning of the first request with
  `Flask.before_first_request`.
* Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception
  instead of a value error which usually would result in a 500
  internal server error if not handled. This is a backwards
  incompatible change.
* Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and
  modules are located but also an instance path which is the
  designated place to drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads
  etc.). Also this is conceptually only instance depending and outside
  version control so it’s the perfect place to put configuration files
  etc.
* Added the `APPLICATION_ROOT` configuration variable.
* Implemented `TestClient.session_transaction` to easily modify
  sessions from the test environment.
* Refactored test client internally. The `APPLICATION_ROOT`
  configuration variable as well as `SERVER_NAME` are now properly
  used by the test client as defaults.
* Added `View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of pluggable
  (class-based) views.
* Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the “with”
  statement did not trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
* Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
* HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the
  `get` method if no handler was implemented.
* Implemented the virtual `flask.ext` package to import extensions
  from.
* The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component
  of Flask itself and no longer of the test client. This cleaned up
  some internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts
  in unittests.
* Fixed the Jinja2 environment’s `list_templates` method not
  returning the correct names when blueprints or modules were
  involved.

## Version 0.7.2[¶](#version-0-7-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-07-06

* Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.

## Version 0.7.1[¶](#version-0-7-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-06-29

* Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
* Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.

## Version 0.7[¶](#version-0-7 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-06-28, codename Grappa

* Added `Flask.make_default_options_response` which can be used by
  subclasses to alter the default behavior for `OPTIONS` responses.
* Unbound locals now raise a proper `RuntimeError` instead of an
  `AttributeError`.
* Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for `send_file` because it was unreliable. Pass
  filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a proper
  mimetype by hand.
* Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the static
  folder to be supplied explicitly. The previous autodetection was not
  reliable and caused issues on Google’s App Engine. Until 1.0 the old
  behavior will continue to work but issue dependency warnings.
* Fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
* Added a `PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to `DEBUG` alone and is now linked to either `DEBUG`
  or `TESTING`.
* Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
* Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with a
  decorator.
* Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which was
  incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
* Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation
  process.
* Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
* Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run
  at the end of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.
  Also the behavior for `after_request` was changed. It’s now no
  longer executed when an exception is raised.
* Implemented `has_request_context`.
* Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`. Override the
  `Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to achieve the
  same functionality.
* Added `safe_join`.
* The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
* Don’t modify the session on `get_flashed_messages` if there are no
  messages in the session.
* `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with
  errors.
* It is not possible to define user exception handlers. That way you
  can provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain
  errors that might occur during request processing (for instance
  database connection errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
* Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
* Implemented generic class-based views.

## Version 0.6.1[¶](#version-0-6-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-12-31

* Fixed an issue where the default `OPTIONS` response was not
  exposing all valid methods in the `Allow` header.
* Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows “./” in front of a
  template load path. Previously this caused issues with module
  setups.
* Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was ignored
  for the static folder.
* Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary
  files if the host server was a windows based operating system and
  the client uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where
  exposed from.

## Version 0.6[¶](#version-0-6 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-27, codename Whisky

* After request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
* OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds ‘OPTIONS’ as method to the URL rule. In
  this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
* Static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder for
  the module. This was implemented to aid GAE which will remove the
  static folder if it’s part of a mapping in the .yml file.
* `Flask.config` is now available in the templates as `config`.
* Context processors will no longer override values passed directly to
  the render function.
* Added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the new
  `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` configuration value.
* The endpoint for the `Module.add_url_rule` method is now optional
  to be consistent with the function of the same name on the
  application object.
* Added a `make_response` function that simplifies creating response
  object instances in views.
* Added signalling support based on blinker. This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications. If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker` installed.
* Refactored the way URL adapters are created. This process is now
  fully customizable with the `Flask.create_url_adapter` method.
* Modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix. This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

## Version 0.5.2[¶](#version-0-5-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-15

* Fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.

## Version 0.5.1[¶](#version-0-5-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-06

* Fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.

## Version 0.5[¶](#version-0-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-06, codename Calvados

* Fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name. The server name can now be set with the
  `SERVER_NAME` config key. This key is now also used to set the
  session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
* Autoescaping is no longer active for all templates. Instead it is
  only active for `.html`, `.htm`, `.xml` and `.xhtml`. Inside
  templates this behavior can be changed with the `autoescape` tag.
* Refactored Flask internally. It now consists of more than a single
  file.
* `send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to do conditional
  responses builtin.
* (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications. This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
* Added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
* Removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
* Added a helper function to expose files from any directory.

## Version 0.4[¶](#version-0-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-06-18, codename Rakia

* Added the ability to register application wide error handlers from
  modules.
* `Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked if the request
  dies with an exception and an error handling page kicks in.
* Test client has not the ability to preserve the request context for
  a little longer. This can also be used to trigger custom requests
  that do not pop the request stack for testing.
* Because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of the
  logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
* Added `TESTING` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
* The logger switches to `DEBUG` mode now if debug is enabled.

## Version 0.3.1[¶](#version-0-3-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-28

* Fixed a error reporting bug with `Config.from_envvar`.
* Removed some unused code.
* Release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and some
  .pyc files)

## Version 0.3[¶](#version-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-28, codename Schnaps

* Added support for categories for flashed messages.
* The application now configures a `logging.Handler` and will log
  request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug mode.
  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors for
  example.
* Added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
* The request context is now available within the with statement
  making it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
* Added support for configurations.

## Version 0.2[¶](#version-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-12, codename J?germeister

* Various bugfixes
* Integrated JSON support
* Added `get_template_attribute` helper function.
* `Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a view function.
* Refactored internal request dispatching.
* Server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with
  chrome.
* Added external URL support.
* Added support for `send_file`.
* Module support and internal request handling refactoring to better
  support pluggable applications.
* Sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
* Better error reporting on missing secret keys.
* Added support for Google Appengine.

## Version 0.1[¶](#version-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-04-16

* First public preview release.

Package        : flask
Version        : 1.0.2-3+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-30861
Debian Bug     : #1035670

It was discovered that Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application
framework, will under certain conditions cache a response containing
data intended for one client and subsequently may send the response to
other clients.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.2-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your flask packages.

For the detailed security status of flask please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/flask>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

  about resource limits to the security page. [#5625](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5625)
* Add support for the `Partitioned` cookie attribute (CHIPS), with the
  `SESSION_COOKIE_PARTITIONED` config. [#5472](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5472)
* `-e path` takes precedence over default `.env` and `.flaskenv` files.
  `load_dotenv` loads default files in addition to a path unless
  `load_defaults=False` is passed. [#5628](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5628)
* Support key rotation with the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` config, a list of old
  secret keys that can still be used for unsigning. Extensions will need to
  add support. [#5621](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5621)
* Fix how setting `host_matching=True` or `subdomain_matching=False`
  interacts with `SERVER_NAME`. Setting `SERVER_NAME` no longer restricts
  requests to only that domain. [#5553](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5553)
* `Request.trusted_hosts` is checked during routing, and can be set through
  the `TRUSTED_HOSTS` config. [#5636](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5636)

## Version 3.0.3[¶](#version-3-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-04-07

* The default `hashlib.sha1` may not be available in FIPS builds. Don’t
  access it at import time so the developer has time to change the default.
  [#5448](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5448)
* Don’t initialize the `cli` attribute in the sansio scaffold, but rather in
  the `Flask` concrete class. [#5270](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5270)

## Version 3.0.2[¶](#version-3-0-2 "Link to this heading")

* Fix a typo in an error message for the `flask run --key` option. [#5344](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5344)
* Session data is untagged without relying on the built-in `json.loads`
  `object_hook`. This allows other JSON providers that don’t implement that.
  [#5381](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5381)
* Address more type findings when using mypy strict mode. [#5383](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5383)

  itsdangerous>=2.1.2, click>=8.1.3.
* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4995](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4995)

  + The `push` and `pop` methods of the deprecated `_app_ctx_stack` and
    `_request_ctx_stack` objects are removed. `top` still exists to give
    extensions more time to update, but it will be removed.
  + The `FLASK_ENV` environment variable, `ENV` config key, and `app.env`
    property are removed.
  + The `session_cookie_name`, `send_file_max_age_default`, `use_x_sendfile`,
    `propagate_exceptions`, and `templates_auto_reload` properties on `app`
    are removed.
  + The `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`, `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and
    `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` config keys are removed.
  + The `app.before_first_request` and `bp.before_app_first_request` decorators
    are removed.
  + `json_encoder` and `json_decoder` attributes on app and blueprint, and the
    corresponding `json.JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes, are removed.
  + The `json.htmlsafe_dumps` and `htmlsafe_dump` functions are removed.
  + Calling setup methods on blueprints after registration is an error instead of a
    warning. [#4997](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4997)
* Importing `escape` and `Markup` from `flask` is deprecated. Import them
  directly from `markupsafe` instead. [#4996](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4996)
* The `app.got_first_request` property is deprecated. [#4997](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4997)
* The `locked_cached_property` decorator is deprecated. Use a lock inside the
  decorated function if locking is needed. [#4993](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4993)
* Signals are always available. `blinker>=1.6.2` is a required dependency. The
  `signals_available` attribute is deprecated. [#5056](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5056)
* Signals support `async` subscriber functions. [#5049](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5049)
* Remove uses of locks that could cause requests to block each other very briefly.
  [#4993](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4993)
* Use modern packaging metadata with `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.cfg`.
  [#4947](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4947)
* Ensure subdomains are applied with nested blueprints. [#4834](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4834)
* `config.from_file` can use `text=False` to indicate that the parser wants a
  binary file instead. [#4989](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4989)
* If a blueprint is created with an empty name it raises a `ValueError`.
  [#5010](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5010)
* `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` does not fall back to `SERVER_NAME`. The default is not
  to set the domain, which modern browsers interpret as an exact match rather than
  a subdomain match. Warnings about `localhost` and IP addresses are also removed.
  [#5051](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5051)
* The `routes` command shows each rule’s `subdomain` or `host` when domain
  matching is in use. [#5004](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/5004)
* Use postponed evaluation of annotations. [#5071](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/5071)

## Version 2.2.5[¶](#version-2-2-5 "Link to this heading")

* Autoescape is enabled by default for `.svg` template files. [#4831](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4831)
* Fix the type of `template_folder` to accept `pathlib.Path`. [#4892](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4892)
* Add `--debug` option to the `flask run` command. [#4777](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4777)

  to the new faster router, header parsing, and the development
  server. [#4754](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4754)
* Fix the default value for `app.env` to be `"production"`. This
  attribute remains deprecated. [#4740](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4740)

## Version 2.2.1[¶](#version-2-2-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-08-03

* Setting or accessing `json_encoder` or `json_decoder` raises a
  deprecation warning. [#4732](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4732)

## Version 2.2.0[¶](#version-2-2-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-08-01

* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4667](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4667)

  + Old names for some `send_file` parameters have been removed.
    `download_name` replaces `attachment_filename`, `max_age`
    replaces `cache_timeout`, and `etag` replaces `add_etags`.
    Additionally, `path` replaces `filename` in
    `send_from_directory`.
  + The `RequestContext.g` property returning `AppContext.g` is
    removed.
* Update Werkzeug dependency to >= 2.2.
* The app and request contexts are managed using Python context vars
  directly rather than Werkzeug’s `LocalStack`. This should result
  in better performance and memory use. [#4682](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4682)

  + Extension maintainers, be aware that `_app_ctx_stack.top`
    and `_request_ctx_stack.top` are deprecated. Store data on
    `g` instead using a unique prefix, like
    `g._extension_name_attr`.
* The `FLASK_ENV` environment variable and `app.env` attribute are
  deprecated, removing the distinction between development and debug
  mode. Debug mode should be controlled directly using the `--debug`
  option or `app.run(debug=True)`. [#4714](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4714)
* Some attributes that proxied config keys on `app` are deprecated:
  `session_cookie_name`, `send_file_max_age_default`,
  `use_x_sendfile`, `propagate_exceptions`, and
  `templates_auto_reload`. Use the relevant config keys instead.
  [#4716](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4716)
* Add new customization points to the `Flask` app object for many
  previously global behaviors.

  + `flask.url_for` will call `app.url_for`. [#4568](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4568)
  + `flask.abort` will call `app.aborter`.
    `Flask.aborter_class` and `Flask.make_aborter` can be used
    to customize this aborter. [#4567](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4567)
  + `flask.redirect` will call `app.redirect`. [#4569](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4569)
  + `flask.json` is an instance of `JSONProvider`. A different
    provider can be set to use a different JSON library.
    `flask.jsonify` will call `app.json.response`, other
    functions in `flask.json` will call corresponding functions in
    `app.json`. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* JSON configuration is moved to attributes on the default
  `app.json` provider. `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`,
  `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` are
  deprecated. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* Setting custom `json_encoder` and `json_decoder` classes on the
  app or a blueprint, and the corresponding `json.JSONEncoder` and
  `JSONDecoder` classes, are deprecated. JSON behavior can now be
  overridden using the `app.json` provider interface. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* `json.htmlsafe_dumps` and `json.htmlsafe_dump` are deprecated,
  the function is built-in to Jinja now. [#4692](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4692)
* Refactor `register_error_handler` to consolidate error checking.
  Rewrite some error messages to be more consistent. [#4559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4559)
* Use Blueprint decorators and functions intended for setup after
  registering the blueprint will show a warning. In the next version,
  this will become an error just like the application setup methods.
  [#4571](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4571)
* `before_first_request` is deprecated. Run setup code when creating
  the application instead. [#4605](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4605)
* Added the `View.init_every_request` class attribute. If a view
  subclass sets this to `False`, the view will not create a new
  instance on every request. [#2520](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2520).
* A `flask.cli.FlaskGroup` Click group can be nested as a
  sub-command in a custom CLI. [#3263](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3263)
* Add `--app` and `--debug` options to the `flask` CLI, instead
  of requiring that they are set through environment variables.
  [#2836](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2836)
* Add `--env-file` option to the `flask` CLI. This allows
  specifying a dotenv file to load in addition to `.env` and
  `.flaskenv`. [#3108](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3108)
* It is no longer required to decorate custom CLI commands on
  `app.cli` or `blueprint.cli` with `@with_appcontext`, an app
  context will already be active at that point. [#2410](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2410)
* `SessionInterface.get_expiration_time` uses a timezone-aware
  value. [#4645](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4645)
* View functions can return generators directly instead of wrapping
  them in a `Response`. [#4629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4629)
* Add `stream_template` and `stream_template_string` functions to
  render a template as a stream of pieces. [#4629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4629)
* A new implementation of context preservation during debugging and
  testing. [#4666](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4666)

  + `request`, `g`, and other context-locals point to the
    correct data when running code in the interactive debugger
    console. [#2836](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2836)
  + Teardown functions are always run at the end of the request,
    even if the context is preserved. They are also run after the
    preserved context is popped.
  + `stream_with_context` preserves context separately from a
    `with client` block. It will be cleaned up when
    `response.get_data()` or `response.close()` is called.
* Allow returning a list from a view function, to convert it to a
  JSON response like a dict is. [#4672](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4672)
* When type checking, allow `TypedDict` to be returned from view
  functions. [#4695](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4695)
* Remove the `--eager-loading/--lazy-loading` options from the
  `flask run` command. The app is always eager loaded the first
  time, then lazily loaded in the reloader. The reloader always prints
  errors immediately but continues serving. Remove the internal
  `DispatchingApp` middleware used by the previous implementation.
  [#4715](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4715)

## Version 2.1.3[¶](#version-2-1-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-07-13

* Inline some optional imports that are only used for certain CLI
  commands. [#4606](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4606)
* Relax type annotation for `after_request` functions. [#4600](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4600)
* `instance_path` for namespace packages uses the path closest to
  the imported submodule. [#4610](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4610)
* Clearer error message when `render_template` and
  `render_template_string` are used outside an application context.
  [#4693](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4693)

## Version 2.1.2[¶](#version-2-1-2 "Link to this heading")

* Remove previously deprecated code. [#4337](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4337)

  + The CLI does not pass `script_info` to app factory functions.
  + `config.from_json` is replaced by
    `config.from_file(name, load=json.load)`.
  + `json` functions no longer take an `encoding` parameter.
  + `safe_join` is removed, use `werkzeug.utils.safe_join`
    instead.
  + `total_seconds` is removed, use `timedelta.total_seconds`
    instead.
  + The same blueprint cannot be registered with the same name. Use
    `name=` when registering to specify a unique name.
  + The test client’s `as_tuple` parameter is removed. Use
    `response.request.environ` instead. [#4417](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4417)
* Some parameters in `send_file` and `send_from_directory` were
  renamed in 2.0. The deprecation period for the old names is extended
  to 2.2. Be sure to test with deprecation warnings visible.

  + `attachment_filename` is renamed to `download_name`.
  + `cache_timeout` is renamed to `max_age`.
  + `add_etags` is renamed to `etag`.
  + `filename` is renamed to `path`.
* The `RequestContext.g` property is deprecated. Use `g` directly
  or `AppContext.g` instead. [#3898](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3898)
* `copy_current_request_context` can decorate async functions.
  [#4303](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4303)
* The CLI uses `importlib.metadata` instead of `pkg_resources` to
  load command entry points. [#4419](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4419)
* Overriding `FlaskClient.open` will not cause an error on redirect.
  [#3396](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3396)
* Add an `--exclude-patterns` option to the `flask run` CLI
  command to specify patterns that will be ignored by the reloader.
  [#4188](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4188)
* When using lazy loading (the default with the debugger), the Click
  context from the `flask run` command remains available in the
  loader thread. [#4460](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4460)
* Deleting the session cookie uses the `httponly` flag.
  [#4485](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4485)
* Relax typing for `errorhandler` to allow the user to use more
  precise types and decorate the same function multiple times.
  [#4095, 4295, 4297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4095%2C%204295%2C%204297)
* Fix typing for `__exit__` methods for better compatibility with
  `ExitStack`. [#4474](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4474)
* From Werkzeug, for redirect responses the `Location` header URL
  will remain relative, and exclude the scheme and domain, by default.
  [#4496](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4496)
* Add `Config.from_prefixed_env()` to load config values from
  environment variables that start with `FLASK_` or another prefix.
  This parses values as JSON by default, and allows setting keys in
  nested dicts. [#4479](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4479)

## Version 2.0.3[¶](#version-2-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-02-14

* The test client’s `as_tuple` parameter is deprecated and will be
  removed in Werkzeug 2.1. It is now also deprecated in Flask, to be
  removed in Flask 2.1, while remaining compatible with both in
  2.0.x. Use `response.request.environ` instead. [#4341](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4341)
* Fix type annotation for `errorhandler` decorator. [#4295](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4295)
* Revert a change to the CLI that caused it to hide `ImportError`
  tracebacks when importing the application. [#4307](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4307)
* `app.json_encoder` and `json_decoder` are only passed to
  `dumps` and `loads` if they have custom behavior. This improves
  performance, mainly on PyPy. [#4349](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4349)
* Clearer error message when `after_this_request` is used outside a
  request context. [#4333](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4333)

## Version 2.0.2[¶](#version-2-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-10-04

* Fix type annotation for `teardown_*` methods. [#4093](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4093)
* Fix type annotation for `before_request` and `before_app_request`
  decorators. [#4104](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4104)
* Fixed the issue where typing requires template global
  decorators to accept functions with no arguments. [#4098](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4098)
* Support View and MethodView instances with async handlers. [#4112](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4112)
* Enhance typing of `app.errorhandler` decorator. [#4095](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4095)
* Fix registering a blueprint twice with differing names. [#4124](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4124)
* Fix the type of `static_folder` to accept `pathlib.Path`.
  [#4150](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4150)
* `jsonify` handles `decimal.Decimal` by encoding to `str`.
  [#4157](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4157)
* Correctly handle raising deferred errors in CLI lazy loading.
  [#4096](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4096)
* The CLI loader handles `**kwargs` in a `create_app` function.
  [#4170](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4170)
* Fix the order of `before_request` and other callbacks that trigger
  before the view returns. They are called from the app down to the
  closest nested blueprint. [#4229](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4229)

## Version 2.0.1[¶](#version-2-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-21

* Re-add the `filename` parameter in `send_from_directory`. The
  `filename` parameter has been renamed to `path`, the old name
  is deprecated. [#4019](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4019)
* Mark top-level names as exported so type checking understands
  imports in user projects. [#4024](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4024)
* Fix type annotation for `g` and inform mypy that it is a namespace
  object that has arbitrary attributes. [#4020](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4020)
* Fix some types that weren’t available in Python 3.6.0. [#4040](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4040)
* Improve typing for `send_file`, `send_from_directory`, and
  `get_send_file_max_age`. [#4044](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4044), [#4026](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4026)
* Show an error when a blueprint name contains a dot. The `.` has
  special meaning, it is used to separate (nested) blueprint names and
  the endpoint name. [#4041](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4041)
* Combine URL prefixes when nesting blueprints that were created with
  a `url_prefix` value. [#4037](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4037)
* Revert a change to the order that URL matching was done. The
  URL is again matched after the session is loaded, so the session is
  available in custom URL converters. [#4053](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4053)
* Re-add deprecated `Config.from_json`, which was accidentally
  removed early. [#4078](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4078)
* Improve typing for some functions using `Callable` in their type
  signatures, focusing on decorator factories. [#4060](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4060)
* Nested blueprints are registered with their dotted name. This allows
  different blueprints with the same name to be nested at different
  locations. [#4069](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4069)
* `register_blueprint` takes a `name` option to change the
  (pre-dotted) name the blueprint is registered with. This allows the
  same blueprint to be registered multiple times with unique names for
  `url_for`. Registering the same blueprint with the same name
  multiple times is deprecated. [#1091](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1091)
* Improve typing for `stream_with_context`. [#4052](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4052)

## Version 2.0.0[¶](#version-2-0-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-11

* Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.
* Bump minimum versions of other Pallets projects: Werkzeug >= 2,
  Jinja2 >= 3, MarkupSafe >= 2, ItsDangerous >= 2, Click >= 8. Be sure
  to check the change logs for each project. For better compatibility
  with other applications (e.g. Celery) that still require Click 7,
  there is no hard dependency on Click 8 yet, but using Click 7 will
  trigger a DeprecationWarning and Flask 2.1 will depend on Click 8.
* JSON support no longer uses simplejson. To use another JSON module,
  override `app.json_encoder` and `json_decoder`. [#3555](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3555)
* The `encoding` option to JSON functions is deprecated. [#3562](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3562)
* Passing `script_info` to app factory functions is deprecated. This
  was not portable outside the `flask` command. Use
  `click.get_current_context().obj` if it’s needed. [#3552](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3552)
* The CLI shows better error messages when the app failed to load
  when looking up commands. [#2741](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2741)
* Add `SessionInterface.get_cookie_name` to allow setting the
  session cookie name dynamically. [#3369](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3369)
* Add `Config.from_file` to load config using arbitrary file
  loaders, such as `toml.load` or `json.load`.
  `Config.from_json` is deprecated in favor of this. [#3398](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3398)
* The `flask run` command will only defer errors on reload. Errors
  present during the initial call will cause the server to exit with
  the traceback immediately. [#3431](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3431)
* `send_file` raises a `ValueError` when passed an `io` object
  in text mode. Previously, it would respond with 200 OK and an empty
  file. [#3358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3358)
* When using ad-hoc certificates, check for the cryptography library
  instead of PyOpenSSL. [#3492](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3492)
* When specifying a factory function with `FLASK_APP`, keyword
  argument can be passed. [#3553](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3553)
* When loading a `.env` or `.flaskenv` file, the current working
  directory is no longer changed to the location of the file.
  [#3560](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3560)
* When returning a `(response, headers)` tuple from a view, the
  headers replace rather than extend existing headers on the response.
  For example, this allows setting the `Content-Type` for
  `jsonify()`. Use `response.headers.extend()` if extending is
  desired. [#3628](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3628)
* The `Scaffold` class provides a common API for the `Flask` and
  `Blueprint` classes. `Blueprint` information is stored in
  attributes just like `Flask`, rather than opaque lambda functions.
  This is intended to improve consistency and maintainability.
  [#3215](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3215)
* Include `samesite` and `secure` options when removing the
  session cookie. [#3726](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3726)
* Support passing a `pathlib.Path` to `static_folder`. [#3579](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3579)
* `send_file` and `send_from_directory` are wrappers around the
  implementations in `werkzeug.utils`. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* Some `send_file` parameters have been renamed, the old names are
  deprecated. `attachment_filename` is renamed to `download_name`.
  `cache_timeout` is renamed to `max_age`. `add_etags` is
  renamed to `etag`. [#3828, 3883](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828%2C%203883)
* `send_file` passes `download_name` even if
  `as_attachment=False` by using `Content-Disposition: inline`.
  [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* `send_file` sets `conditional=True` and `max_age=None` by
  default. `Cache-Control` is set to `no-cache` if `max_age` is
  not set, otherwise `public`. This tells browsers to validate
  conditional requests instead of using a timed cache. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* `helpers.safe_join` is deprecated. Use
  `werkzeug.utils.safe_join` instead. [#3828](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3828)
* The request context does route matching before opening the session.
  This could allow a session interface to change behavior based on
  `request.endpoint`. [#3776](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3776)
* Use Jinja’s implementation of the `|tojson` filter. [#3881](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3881)
* Add route decorators for common HTTP methods. For example,
  `@app.post("/login")` is a shortcut for
  `@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])`. [#3907](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3907)
* Support async views, error handlers, before and after request, and
  teardown functions. [#3412](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3412)
* Support nesting blueprints. [#593, 1548](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/593%2C%201548), [#3923](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3923)
* Set the default encoding to “UTF-8” when loading `.env` and
  `.flaskenv` files to allow to use non-ASCII characters. [#3931](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3931)
* `flask shell` sets up tab and history completion like the default
  `python` shell if `readline` is installed. [#3941](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3941)
* `helpers.total_seconds()` is deprecated. Use
  `timedelta.total_seconds()` instead. [#3962](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3962)
* Add type hinting. [#3973](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3973).

## Version 1.1.4[¶](#version-1-1-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-13

* Update `static_folder` to use `_compat.fspath` instead of
  `os.fspath` to continue supporting Python < 3.6 [#4050](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4050)

## Version 1.1.3[¶](#version-1-1-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-13

* Set maximum versions of Werkzeug, Jinja, Click, and ItsDangerous.
  [#4043](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/4043)
* Re-add support for passing a `pathlib.Path` for `static_folder`.
  [#3579](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3579)

## Version 1.1.2[¶](#version-1-1-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2020-04-03

* Work around an issue when running the `flask` command with an
  external debugger on Windows. [#3297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3297)
* The static route will not catch all URLs if the `Flask`
  `static_folder` argument ends with a slash. [#3452](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3452)

## Version 1.1.1[¶](#version-1-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-08

* The `flask.json_available` flag was added back for compatibility
  with some extensions. It will raise a deprecation warning when used,
  and will be removed in version 2.0.0. [#3288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3288)

## Version 1.1.0[¶](#version-1-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-04

* Bump minimum Werkzeug version to >= 0.15.
* Drop support for Python 3.4.
* Error handlers for `InternalServerError` or `500` will always be
  passed an instance of `InternalServerError`. If they are invoked
  due to an unhandled exception, that original exception is now
  available as `e.original_exception` rather than being passed
  directly to the handler. The same is true if the handler is for the
  base `HTTPException`. This makes error handler behavior more
  consistent. [#3266](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3266)

  + `Flask.finalize_request` is called for all unhandled
    exceptions even if there is no `500` error handler.
* `Flask.logger` takes the same name as `Flask.name` (the value
  passed as `Flask(import_name)`. This reverts 1.0’s behavior of
  always logging to `"flask.app"`, in order to support multiple apps
  in the same process. A warning will be shown if old configuration is
  detected that needs to be moved. [#2866](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2866)
* `RequestContext.copy` includes the current session object in the
  request context copy. This prevents `session` pointing to an
  out-of-date object. [#2935](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2935)
* Using built-in RequestContext, unprintable Unicode characters in
  Host header will result in a HTTP 400 response and not HTTP 500 as
  previously. [#2994](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2994)
* `send_file` supports `PathLike` objects as described in
  [**PEP 519**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0519/), to support `pathlib` in Python 3. [#3059](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3059)
* `send_file` supports `BytesIO` partial content.
  [#2957](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2957)
* `open_resource` accepts the “rt” file mode. This still does the
  same thing as “r”. [#3163](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3163)
* The `MethodView.methods` attribute set in a base class is used by
  subclasses. [#3138](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3138)
* `Flask.jinja_options` is a `dict` instead of an
  `ImmutableDict` to allow easier configuration. Changes must still
  be made before creating the environment. [#3190](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3190)
* Flask’s `JSONMixin` for the request and response wrappers was
  moved into Werkzeug. Use Werkzeug’s version with Flask-specific
  support. This bumps the Werkzeug dependency to >= 0.15.
  [#3125](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3125)
* The `flask` command entry point is simplified to take advantage
  of Werkzeug 0.15’s better reloader support. This bumps the Werkzeug
  dependency to >= 0.15. [#3022](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3022)
* Support `static_url_path` that ends with a forward slash.
  [#3134](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3134)
* Support empty `static_folder` without requiring setting an empty
  `static_url_path` as well. [#3124](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3124)
* `jsonify` supports `dataclass` objects. [#3195](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3195)
* Allow customizing the `Flask.url_map_class` used for routing.
  [#3069](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3069)
* The development server port can be set to 0, which tells the OS to
  pick an available port. [#2926](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2926)
* The return value from `cli.load_dotenv` is more consistent with
  the documentation. It will return `False` if python-dotenv is not
  installed, or if the given path isn’t a file. [#2937](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2937)
* Signaling support has a stub for the `connect_via` method when
  the Blinker library is not installed. [#3208](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3208)
* Add an `--extra-files` option to the `flask run` CLI command to
  specify extra files that will trigger the reloader on change.
  [#2897](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2897)
* Allow returning a dictionary from a view function. Similar to how
  returning a string will produce a `text/html` response, returning
  a dict will call `jsonify` to produce a `application/json`
  response. [#3111](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3111)
* Blueprints have a `cli` Click group like `app.cli`. CLI commands
  registered with a blueprint will be available as a group under the
  `flask` command. [#1357](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1357).
* When using the test client as a context manager (`with client:`),
  all preserved request contexts are popped when the block exits,
  ensuring nested contexts are cleaned up correctly. [#3157](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3157)
* Show a better error message when the view return type is not
  supported. [#3214](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3214)
* `flask.testing.make_test_environ_builder()` has been deprecated in
  favour of a new class `flask.testing.EnvironBuilder`. [#3232](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3232)
* The `flask run` command no longer fails if Python is not built
  with SSL support. Using the `--cert` option will show an
  appropriate error message. [#3211](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3211)
* URL matching now occurs after the request context is pushed, rather
  than when it’s created. This allows custom URL converters to access
  the app and request contexts, such as to query a database for an id.
  [#3088](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3088)

## Version 1.0.4[¶](#version-1-0-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-07-04

* The key information for `BadRequestKeyError` is no longer cleared
  outside debug mode, so error handlers can still access it. This
  requires upgrading to Werkzeug 0.15.5. [#3249](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3249)
* `send_file` url quotes the “:” and “/” characters for more
  compatible UTF-8 filename support in some browsers. [#3074](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3074)
* Fixes for [**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) import loaders and pytest 5.x. [#3275](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3275)
* Show message about dotenv on stderr instead of stdout. [#3285](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3285)

## Version 1.0.3[¶](#version-1-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-05-17

* `send_file` encodes filenames as ASCII instead of Latin-1
  (ISO-8859-1). This fixes compatibility with Gunicorn, which is
  stricter about header encodings than [**PEP 3333**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/). [#2766](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2766)
* Allow custom CLIs using `FlaskGroup` to set the debug flag without
  it always being overwritten based on environment variables.
  [#2765](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2765)
* `flask --version` outputs Werkzeug’s version and simplifies the
  Python version. [#2825](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2825)
* `send_file` handles an `attachment_filename` that is a native
  Python 2 string (bytes) with UTF-8 coded bytes. [#2933](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2933)
* A catch-all error handler registered for `HTTPException` will not
  handle `RoutingException`, which is used internally during
  routing. This fixes the unexpected behavior that had been introduced
  in 1.0. [#2986](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2986)
* Passing the `json` argument to `app.test_client` does not
  push/pop an extra app context. [#2900](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2900)

## Version 1.0.2[¶](#version-1-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-05-02

* Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
  a blueprint prefix and route. [#2748](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748)
* Fix error with `flask routes` command when there are no routes.
  [#2751](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751)

## Version 1.0.1[¶](#version-1-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-04-29

* Fix registering partials (with no `__name__`) as view functions.
  [#2730](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730)
* Don’t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
  Only tuples are interpreted as response data. [#2736](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2736)
* Extra slashes between a blueprint’s `url_prefix` and a route URL
  are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
  change in 1.0. [#2731](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2731), [#2742](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742)
* Only trap `BadRequestKeyError` errors in debug mode, not all
  `BadRequest` errors. This allows `abort(400)` to continue
  working as expected. [#2735](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2735)
* The `FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV` environment variable can be set to `1`
  to skip automatically loading dotenv files. [#2722](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722)

## Version 1.0[¶](#version-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2018-04-26

* Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.
* Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
  Werkzeug >= 0.14, Jinja >= 2.10, itsdangerous >= 0.24, Click >= 5.1.
  [#2586](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2586)
* Skip `app.run` when a Flask application is run from the command
  line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing to debug.
* Change the default for `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
  `False`. `~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by default,
  and an indented format in debug mode. [#2193](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2193)
* `Flask.__init__` accepts the `host_matching` argument and sets
  it on `Flask.url_map`. [#1559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1559)
* `Flask.__init__` accepts the `static_host` argument and passes
  it as the `host` argument when defining the static route.
  [#1559](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1559)
* `send_file` supports Unicode in `attachment_filename`.
  [#2223](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2223)
* Pass `_scheme` argument from `url_for` to
  `Flask.handle_url_build_error`. [#2017](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2017)
* `Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the `provide_automatic_options`
  argument to disable adding the `OPTIONS` method. [#1489](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1489)
* `MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from base classes.
  [#1936](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1936)
* Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
  request are handled by the app’s error handlers. [#2254](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2254)
* Blueprints gained `Blueprint.json_encoder` and
  `Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app’s
  encoder and decoder. [#1898](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1898)
* `Flask.make_response` raises `TypeError` instead of
  `ValueError` for bad response types. The error messages have been
  improved to describe why the type is invalid. [#2256](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2256)
* Add `routes` CLI command to output routes registered on the
  application. [#2259](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2259)
* Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
  address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
  Chrome. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is set if it is detected through
  `SERVER_NAME`. [#2282](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2282)
* Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called `create_app` or
  `make_app` from `FLASK_APP`. [#2297](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2297)
* Factory functions are not required to take a `script_info`
  parameter to work with the `flask` command. If they take a single
  parameter or a parameter named `script_info`, the `ScriptInfo`
  object will be passed. [#2319](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2319)
* `FLASK_APP` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
  needed, for example `FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app('dev')`.
  [#2326](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2326)
* `FLASK_APP` can point to local packages that are not installed in
  editable mode, although `pip install -e` is still preferred.
  [#2414](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2414)
* The `View` class attribute
  `View.provide_automatic_options` is set in `View.as_view`, to be
  detected by `Flask.add_url_rule`. [#2316](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2316)
* Error handling will try handlers registered for `blueprint, code`,
  `app, code`, `blueprint, exception`, `app, exception`.
  [#2314](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2314)
* `Cookie` is added to the response’s `Vary` header if the session
  is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). [#2288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2288)
* `Flask.test_request_context` accepts `subdomain` and
  `url_scheme` arguments for use when building the base URL.
  [#1621](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1621)
* Set `APPLICATION_ROOT` to `'/'` by default. This was already the
  implicit default when it was set to `None`.
* `TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
  `BadRequestKeyError` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
  instead of the generic bad request message. [#2348](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2348)
* Allow registering new tags with `TaggedJSONSerializer` to support
  storing other types in the session cookie. [#2352](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2352)
* Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
  context stack yet. This allows `stream_with_context` generators to
  access the same session that the containing view uses. [#2354](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2354)
* Add `json` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
  This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
  content type. [#2358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2358)
* Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the `Request` and
  `Response` classes. This adds the `Response.is_json` and
  `Response.get_json` methods to the response to make testing JSON
  response much easier. [#2358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2358)
* Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
  for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
  explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
  MRO. [#2362](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2362)
* Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. [#2374](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2374)
* Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even if
  `Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. [#2373](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2373)
* The following old deprecated code was removed. [#2385](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2385)

  + `flask.ext` - import extensions directly by their name instead
    of through the `flask.ext` namespace. For example,
    `import flask.ext.sqlalchemy` becomes
    `import flask_sqlalchemy`.
  + `Flask.init_jinja_globals` - extend
    `Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
  + `Flask.error_handlers` - tracked by
    `Flask.error_handler_spec`, use `Flask.errorhandler`
    to register handlers.
  + `Flask.request_globals_class` - use
    `Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
  + `Flask.static_path` - use `Flask.static_url_path` instead.
  + `Request.module` - use `Request.blueprint` instead.
* The `Request.json` property is no longer deprecated. [#1421](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1421)
* Support passing a `EnvironBuilder` or `dict` to
  `test_client.open`. [#2412](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2412)
* The `flask` command and `Flask.run` will load environment
  variables from `.env` and `.flaskenv` files if python-dotenv is
  installed. [#2416](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2416)
* When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
  used instead of `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. [#2430](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2430)
* `Flask.logger` has been simplified. `LOGGER_NAME` and
  `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` config was removed. The logger is always
  named `flask.app`. The level is only set on first access, it
  doesn’t check `Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is used,
  not different ones depending on `Flask.debug`. No handlers are
  removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are already
  configured. [#2436](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2436)
* Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. [#2450](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2450)
* Fix a `ValueError` caused by invalid `Range` requests in some
  cases. [#2526](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2526)
* The development server uses threads by default. [#2529](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2529)
* Loading config files with `silent=True` will ignore `ENOTDIR`
  errors. [#2581](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2581)
* Pass `--cert` and `--key` options to `flask run` to run the
  development server over HTTPS. [#2606](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2606)
* Added `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the `SameSite`
  attribute on the session cookie. [#2607](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2607)
* Added `Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner that can
  invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. [#2636](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2636)
* Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
  `SERVER_NAME` does not implicitly enable it. It can be enabled by
  passing `subdomain_matching=True` to the `Flask` constructor.
  [#2635](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2635)
* A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
  `url_prefix` when it is registered with the app. [#2629](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2629)
* `Request.get_json` doesn’t cache the result if parsing fails when
  `silent` is true. [#2651](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2651)
* `Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings. Incoming
  JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per [**RFC 8259**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259.html), but Flask will
  autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. [#2691](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2691)
* Added `MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and `Response.max_cookie_size` to
  control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
  ignore. [#2693](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2693)
* Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
  windows. [#2709](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2709)
* Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
  structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

  for `app.run`. [#2109](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2109), [#2152](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2152)
* Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`,
  in the event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt`

Released 2016-12-21, codename Punsch

* The cli command now responds to `--version`.
* Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in
  `send_file` has been removed. [#104](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/104), :pr`1849`

## Version 0.11.1[¶](#version-0-11-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-06-07

* Fixed a bug that prevented `FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py` from
  working. [#1872](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1872)

## Version 0.11[¶](#version-0-11 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-05-29, codename Absinthe

* Added support to serializing top-level arrays to `jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers.
* Added before\_render\_template signal.
* Added `**kwargs` to `Flask.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  `Flask.test_client_class`.
* Added `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior. If set to `True` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  `False` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
* Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
* Added support for returning tuples in the form `(response,
  headers)` from a view function.
* Added `Config.from_json`.
* Added `Flask.config_class`.
* Added `Config.get_namespace`.
* Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug
  mode. This can be configured with the new `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`
  config key.
* Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3’s namespace
  loader.
* Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3’s
  namespace packages.
* Added `flask` and the `flask.cli` module to start the
  local debug server through the click CLI system. This is recommended
  over the old `flask.run()` method as it works faster and more
  reliable due to a different design and also replaces
  `Flask-Script`.
* Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in `werkzeug.exceptions`). This makes it possible for
  an extension author to create exceptions that will by default result
  in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with a custom
  error handler if desired.
* Added `Config.from_mapping`.
* Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled. The log
  format is now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled
  through the `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` configuration key.
* Removed deprecated module functionality.
* Added the `EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING` config flag which when
  enabled will instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.
  This should help users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
* Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for
  template loading.
* Ported test suite to py.test.
* Deprecated `request.json` in favour of `request.get_json()`.
* Add “pretty” and “compressed” separators definitions in jsonify()
  method. Reduces JSON response size when
  `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False` by removing unnecessary white
  space included by default after separators.
* JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because
  it is a convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some
  clients don’t deal well when this newline is missing. [#1262](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262)
* The automatically provided `OPTIONS` method is now correctly
  disabled if the user registered an overriding rule with the
  lowercase-version `options`. [#1288](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1288)
* `flask.json.jsonify` now supports the `datetime.date` type.
  [#1326](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1326)
* Don’t leak exception info of already caught exceptions to context
  teardown handlers. [#1393](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1393)
* Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses. [#1422](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1422)
* Updated extension dev guidelines.
* `flask.g` now has `pop()` and `setdefault` methods.
* Turn on autoescape for `flask.templating.render_template_string`
  by default. [#1515](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1515)
* `flask.ext` is now deprecated. [#1484](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1484)
* `send_from_directory` now raises BadRequest if the filename is
  invalid on the server OS. [#1763](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1763)
* Added the `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE` configuration variable. [#1728](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1728)
* Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad
  application contexts lingering around.
* Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
* Raise an `AttributeError` in `helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import
  hook is used without an `is_package()` method.
* Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request
  or app context to be passed to teardown handlers.
* Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests
  in the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
* Made `@before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
* Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
* Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root
  path correctly.
* Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag
  after invoking. This will allow some uses that are potentially
  dangerous but should probably be permitted.
* Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from
  `app.url_build_error_handlers` reraises the `BuildError`.

## Version 0.10.1[¶](#version-0-10-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-06-14

* Fixed an issue where `|tojson` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes. Now it’s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes. This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
* Added support for byte strings back to the session system. This
  broke compatibility with the common case of people putting binary
  data for token verification into the session.
* Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same
  endpoint would trigger an exception incorrectly.

## Version 0.10[¶](#version-0-10 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-06-13, codename Limoncello

* Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.
* Added `template_test` methods in addition to the already existing
  `template_filter` method family.
* Added `template_global` methods in addition to the already
  existing `template_filter` method family.
* Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
* `tojson` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5
  parsers.
* `tojson` used in templates is now safe by default. This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
* Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new
  function on an already used endpoint.
* Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default
  serialization of datetime objects. This allows much easier
  customization of how JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask
  extension.
* Removed deprecated internal `flask.session` module alias. Use
  `flask.sessions` instead to get the session module. This is not to
  be confused with `flask.session` the session proxy.
* Templates can now be rendered without request context. The behavior
  is slightly different as the `request`, `session` and `g`
  objects will not be available and blueprint’s context processors are
  not called.
* The config object is now available to the template as a real global
  and not through a context processor which makes it available even in
  imported templates by default.
* Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should
  result in less bytes being transmitted over the network. It’s
  disabled by default to not cause confusion with existing libraries
  that might expect `flask.json.dumps` to return bytes by default.
* `flask.g` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
* `flask.g` now gained a `get()` method for not erroring out on
  non existing items.
* `flask.g` now can be used with the `in` operator to see what’s
  defined and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
* `flask.Flask.request_globals_class` got renamed to
  `flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` which is a better name to what
  it does since 0.10.
* `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to
  the template context which makes them available in imported
  templates. One has to be very careful with those though because
  usage outside of macros might cause caching.
* Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
* Added a workaround for chrome’s cookies in localhost not working as
  intended with domain names.
* Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
* Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
* Added support for copying of request contexts for better working
  with greenlets.
* Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses. If you were relying
  on them you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially. Using
  them however is strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
* Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to
  prepare for Python 3.3 port.
* Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions. This
  is now more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway
  through the error handling process.
* Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
* Added the `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` configuration variable.
* Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due
  to different hash seeds between different workers.
* Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
* The builtin run method now takes the `SERVER_NAME` into account
  when picking the default port to run on.
* Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.

## Version 0.9[¶](#version-0-9 "Link to this heading")

Released 2012-07-01, codename Campari

* The `Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
* The `url_for` function now can generate anchors to the generated
  links.
* The `url_for` function now can also explicitly generate URL rules
  specific to a given HTTP method.
* Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
* Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request. This means that
  environ `werkzeug.request` will be `None` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
* Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after request
  callback.
* The `Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name if
  it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build
  Flask instances programmatically. The Flask class will fall back to
  using import on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App
  Engine, or when the import name is inside a zip archive (usually an
  egg) prior to Python 2.7.
* Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters
  application wide, `Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
* The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for
  adding custom template filters application wide,
  `Flask.add_template_filter` and
  `Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
* The `get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a `category_filter`
  argument.
* The `Flask.run` method now accepts `None` for `host` and
  `port` arguments, using default values when `None`. This allows
  for calling run using configuration values, e.g.
  `app.run(app.config.get('MYHOST'), app.config.get('MYPORT'))`,
  with proper behavior whether or not a config file is provided.
* The `render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name. Previously, it only
  accepted a single template name. On an iterable, the first template
  found is rendered.
* Added `Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the request
  context but only provides access to the current application. This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request
  context.
* View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being
  an instance of `Response`. This allows for returning
  `jsonify(error="error msg"), 400` from a view function.
* `Flask` and `Blueprint` now provide a `get_send_file_max_age`
  hook for subclasses to override behavior of serving static files
  from Flask when using `Flask.send_static_file` (used for the
  default static file handler) and `helpers.send_file`. This hook is
  provided a filename, which for example allows changing cache
  controls by file extension. The default max-age for `send_file`
  and static files can be configured through a new
  `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` configuration variable, which is used
  in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
* Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break
  message flashing on sessions implementations which use external
  storage.
* Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions. They are
  no longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined
  meaning.
* Added `Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the `g` instance of each request.
* Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add
  methods on registration.
* Added `flask.after_this_request`.
* Added `flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.

## Version 0.8.1[¶](#version-0-8-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2012-07-01

* Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5. It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.

## Version 0.8[¶](#version-0-8 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-09-29, codename Rakija

* Refactored session support into a session interface so that the
  implementation of the sessions can be changed without having to
  override the Flask class.
* Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
* View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic OPTIONS
  implementation.
* HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that
  they show up normally in the traceback.
* Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries
  to warn you about them.
* Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a
  view was attached after the first request was handled. This gives
  earlier feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of
  time.
* Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once
  at the beginning of the first request with
  `Flask.before_first_request`.
* Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception
  instead of a value error which usually would result in a 500
  internal server error if not handled. This is a backwards
  incompatible change.
* Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and
  modules are located but also an instance path which is the
  designated place to drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads
  etc.). Also this is conceptually only instance depending and outside
  version control so it’s the perfect place to put configuration files
  etc.
* Added the `APPLICATION_ROOT` configuration variable.
* Implemented `TestClient.session_transaction` to easily modify
  sessions from the test environment.
* Refactored test client internally. The `APPLICATION_ROOT`
  configuration variable as well as `SERVER_NAME` are now properly
  used by the test client as defaults.
* Added `View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of pluggable
  (class-based) views.
* Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the “with”
  statement did not trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
* Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
* HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the
  `get` method if no handler was implemented.
* Implemented the virtual `flask.ext` package to import extensions
  from.
* The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component
  of Flask itself and no longer of the test client. This cleaned up
  some internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts
  in unittests.
* Fixed the Jinja2 environment’s `list_templates` method not
  returning the correct names when blueprints or modules were
  involved.

## Version 0.7.2[¶](#version-0-7-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-07-06

* Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.

## Version 0.7.1[¶](#version-0-7-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-06-29

* Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
* Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.

## Version 0.7[¶](#version-0-7 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-06-28, codename Grappa

* Added `Flask.make_default_options_response` which can be used by
  subclasses to alter the default behavior for `OPTIONS` responses.
* Unbound locals now raise a proper `RuntimeError` instead of an
  `AttributeError`.
* Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for `send_file` because it was unreliable. Pass
  filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a proper
  mimetype by hand.
* Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the static
  folder to be supplied explicitly. The previous autodetection was not
  reliable and caused issues on Google’s App Engine. Until 1.0 the old
  behavior will continue to work but issue dependency warnings.
* Fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
* Added a `PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to `DEBUG` alone and is now linked to either `DEBUG`
  or `TESTING`.
* Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
* Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with a
  decorator.
* Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which was
  incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
* Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation
  process.
* Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
* Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run
  at the end of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.
  Also the behavior for `after_request` was changed. It’s now no
  longer executed when an exception is raised.
* Implemented `has_request_context`.
* Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`. Override the
  `Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to achieve the
  same functionality.
* Added `safe_join`.
* The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
* Don’t modify the session on `get_flashed_messages` if there are no
  messages in the session.
* `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with
  errors.
* It is not possible to define user exception handlers. That way you
  can provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain
  errors that might occur during request processing (for instance
  database connection errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
* Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
* Implemented generic class-based views.

## Version 0.6.1[¶](#version-0-6-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-12-31

* Fixed an issue where the default `OPTIONS` response was not
  exposing all valid methods in the `Allow` header.
* Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows “./” in front of a
  template load path. Previously this caused issues with module
  setups.
* Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was ignored
  for the static folder.
* Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary
  files if the host server was a windows based operating system and
  the client uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where
  exposed from.

## Version 0.6[¶](#version-0-6 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-27, codename Whisky

* After request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
* OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds ‘OPTIONS’ as method to the URL rule. In
  this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
* Static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder for
  the module. This was implemented to aid GAE which will remove the
  static folder if it’s part of a mapping in the .yml file.
* `Flask.config` is now available in the templates as `config`.
* Context processors will no longer override values passed directly to
  the render function.
* Added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the new
  `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` configuration value.
* The endpoint for the `Module.add_url_rule` method is now optional
  to be consistent with the function of the same name on the
  application object.
* Added a `make_response` function that simplifies creating response
  object instances in views.
* Added signalling support based on blinker. This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications. If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker` installed.
* Refactored the way URL adapters are created. This process is now
  fully customizable with the `Flask.create_url_adapter` method.
* Modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix. This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

## Version 0.5.2[¶](#version-0-5-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-15

* Fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.

## Version 0.5.1[¶](#version-0-5-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-06

* Fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.

## Version 0.5[¶](#version-0-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-07-06, codename Calvados

* Fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name. The server name can now be set with the
  `SERVER_NAME` config key. This key is now also used to set the
  session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
* Autoescaping is no longer active for all templates. Instead it is
  only active for `.html`, `.htm`, `.xml` and `.xhtml`. Inside
  templates this behavior can be changed with the `autoescape` tag.
* Refactored Flask internally. It now consists of more than a single
  file.
* `send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to do conditional
  responses builtin.
* (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications. This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
* Added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
* Removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
* Added a helper function to expose files from any directory.

## Version 0.4[¶](#version-0-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-06-18, codename Rakia

* Added the ability to register application wide error handlers from
  modules.
* `Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked if the request
  dies with an exception and an error handling page kicks in.
* Test client has not the ability to preserve the request context for
  a little longer. This can also be used to trigger custom requests
  that do not pop the request stack for testing.
* Because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of the
  logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
* Added `TESTING` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
* The logger switches to `DEBUG` mode now if debug is enabled.

## Version 0.3.1[¶](#version-0-3-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-28

* Fixed a error reporting bug with `Config.from_envvar`.
* Removed some unused code.
* Release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and some
  .pyc files)

## Version 0.3[¶](#version-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-28, codename Schnaps

* Added support for categories for flashed messages.
* The application now configures a `logging.Handler` and will log
  request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug mode.
  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors for
  example.
* Added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
* The request context is now available within the with statement
  making it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
* Added support for configurations.

## Version 0.2[¶](#version-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-12, codename J?germeister

* Various bugfixes
* Integrated JSON support
* Added `get_template_attribute` helper function.
* `Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a view function.
* Refactored internal request dispatching.
* Server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with
  chrome.
* Added external URL support.
* Added support for `send_file`.
* Module support and internal request handling refactoring to better
  support pluggable applications.
* Sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
* Better error reporting on missing secret keys.
* Added support for Google Appengine.

## Version 0.1[¶](#version-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-04-16

* First public preview release.

## Flask vulnerable to possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header

High severity

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq/dependabot)

## Package

pip

flask
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.3.0, < 2.3.2
< 2.2.5

## Patched versions

2.3.2
2.2.5

## Description

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on *all* these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets [`session.permanent = True`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.session.permanent).
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. [`SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST) is enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.
 1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies. 2. The application sets `session.permanent = True` 3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request. 4. `SESSION\_REFRESH\_EACH\_REQUEST` enabled (the default). 5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
 This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Flask

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/)
and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.

## A Simple Example

```
# save this as app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```
$ flask run
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

# Flask

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/)
and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.

## A Simple Example

```
# save this as app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```
$ flask run
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

## Donate

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power

  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

# Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header

High

[davidism](/davidism)
published
GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq
May 1, 2023

## Package

pip

flask
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.3.1

## Patched versions

2.2.5, 2.3.2

## Description

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on *all* these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets [`session.permanent = True`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.session.permanent).
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. [`SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST) is enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
