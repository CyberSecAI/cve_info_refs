{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds write in `DoOemFactorySendFactoryTestResult` function of `libsec-ril` library.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `DoOemFactorySendFactoryTestResult` function, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to trigger the vulnerable function is required."
