# A potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< v0.15.2

## Patched versions

v0.15.2

## Description

## Summary:

A potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation.

## Detailed analysis:

The clusternet has a deployment called cluster-hub inside the clusternet-system Kubernetes namespace, which runs on worker nodes

randomly. The deployment has a service account called clusternet-hub, which has a cluster role called clusternet:hub via cluster role binding. The clusternet:hub cluster role has "*" verbs of "*.\*" resources. Thus, if a malicious user can access the worker node which runs the clusternet, he/she can leverage the service account to do malicious actions to critical system resources. For example, he/she can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in the entire cluster, resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
