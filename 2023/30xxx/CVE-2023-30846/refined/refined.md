      "Title": "CVE-2023-30846 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from how the typed-rest-client library in Node.js handles redirects when using authentication handlers.",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "typed-rest-client versions prior to 1.8.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability."
        ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
       "Attack Vectors": [
          "A malicious server can cause a vulnerable client to send authorization headers to a third-party server via a redirect.",
           "The vulnerability is triggered when a client using `typed-rest-client` attempts to access a URL, and that server responds with a redirect to a different URL."
         ],
       "Attacker Capabilities": "An attacker can control the redirect response of a server which is initially targeted by a NetApp product that uses the typed-rest-client library.",
       "Affected Components": [
        "NetApp products incorporating Node.js using typed-rest-client library versions prior to 1.8.0"
