The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in an Aigital WiFi repeater, and specifically mentions CVE-2023-30404 being assigned to one of them.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `FUN_00440290` function within the Boa web server's binary. This function directly passes user-controlled input to the `system` function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unauthenticated RCE:** The webserver does not properly sanitize the user supplied input before passing to the system function, allowing for arbitrary command injection. This is present at `/boafrm/formSyscmd`.
-   **Missing authentication:** The web interface uses a time-based authentication mechanism instead of session cookies, allowing any user on the network to be logged in.
-   **Plaintext credentials:** The device stores and serves the wifi credentials in `/config.dat` in plain text.
-   **Stored XSS:** There is a stored XSS vulnerability in the SSID field of the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the device, gaining full control over it.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** By sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/boafrm/formSyscmd` endpoint, an attacker can inject and execute system commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and able to reach the web interface.
-   No prior authentication is required due to the authentication bypass vulnerability

**Additional Notes**

- The blog post provides more detailed information than a standard CVE description, including the specific function and endpoint involved in the RCE vulnerability.
- The author explains the process of analyzing the device, including hardware analysis, firmware extraction, and reverse engineering the webserver binary.
- The post mentions the assignment of CVE-2023-30402 and CVE-2023-30405 in addition to CVE-2023-30404 to the vulnerabilities reported.
