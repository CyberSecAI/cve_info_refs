# Bullied by Bugcrowd over Kape CyberGhost disclosure

Ceri Coburn
05 May 2023

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2021/05/cyber-toast-headline.png)

### TL;DR

The CyberGhost VPN client suffers from an elevation of privilege vulnerability and is filed under [CVE-2023-30237](https://cve.report/CVE-2023-30237).  A specially crafted JSON payload sent to the CyberGhost RPC service can lead to command line injection when the OpenVPN process is launched, leading to full system compromise.  The latest 8.3.10.10015 version released on the 24 February 2023 fixes this issue.

### Hunting the hunter

This post is as much about a recent EoP vulnerability found within the popular CyberGhost VPN client as my experiences of reporting my first vulnerability via Bugcrowd. Suffice to say, it was the worst disclosure experience I have witnessed to date.

It all started from something I experienced within the CyberGhost VPN eco system that almost ruined a 4-month Red Team operation. All disclosure paths led to Bugcrowd. So, with this in mind I thought I would give it a try. Due to the Bugcrowd T&C’s I can’t really go into much more detail than this, but what was reported was deemed a non-security issue, but a configuration change was made that altered the behaviour of what was reported, but was fixed anyway.

So, we at PTP decided to commission further dedicated research into the CyberGhost client itself. After several days of poking around, a command line injection vulnerability was found. Now some, reading this, might conclude that this was a form of retaliation. To some degree, it was, but not because of missing out on a bounty, I had no interest in that. It was more to do with how the original case was handled and how this affected an ongoing Red Team operation. Therefore, I had no intention whatsoever of reporting this new vulnerability via Bugcrowd.

The first challenge was finding a direct route to disclosure without involving Bugcrowd. Every avenue I tried came to a dead end. Online support pointed me toward Bugcrowd or CyberGhosts own disclosure submission page which was also powered by Bugcrowd. Eventually, a CyberGhost support ticket system representative sent me to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Kape appeared to be the developers behind several well-known consumer VPN products.

After checking the well-known security.txt from the kape.com domain, additionally I could see the [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) email in addition to the Bugcrowd VDP page. Lo and behold, sending an email to this address also resulted in an automated email response from Bugcrowd asking me to claim the submission, but not before agreeing to the T&C’s. Luckily no vulnerability details were sent and was merely a probe to determine if this was a suitable channel to use.

The next day, I did receive a follow up email from a human via the security email address. Kape highlighted that they already covered my concerns via Bugcrowd. Kape had recognised my name from the Bugcrowd report and assumed it was the same vulnerability.

After explaining to Kape that this is nothing to do with the original disclosure, they still insisted that I submit via Bugcrowd. Multiple emails later, as I was clearly getting nowhere, I decided to submit the technical details directly to the security@ email address since there were humans monitoring this mailbox too.

Now what came next amazed me.

Kape had spoken to Bugcrowd directly to ask for advice on how they should deal with out of band contact. Now instead of responding to Kape’s request, Bugcrowd decided to hand me a code of conduct point.

Here are some of the snippets from the email I received from Bugcrowd:

*We are reaching out today because we were made aware that you attempted to appeal a submission decision to the team at Kape VDP directly via email. All communication with any Program Owner should be done through the Bugcrowd platform, to ensure that if something needs to be escalated, we can be aware of it, and for our ASE team to have access to all necessary information related to the submissions.*

*This type of behavior is not tolerated on the Bugcrowd platform because it violates our Code of Conduct and is a behavior explicitly prohibited in our Platform Behavior Standards as “Out of Band Contact”:*

*We can not allow or condone unprofessional behavior, and have established a new point system to track Researchers who violate our site’s rules and Code of Conduct.*

*You currently have a total of 1 point which includes this most recent incident.*

Kape had mentioned that I was trying to disclose an additional vulnerability outside of the platform, Bugcrowd confirmed this, but my understanding of Bugcrowd’s T&Cs regarding Out of Band communication is related to submissions already made via the platform. Bugcrowd and their clients do not indefinitely hold any rights to future vulnerabilities that a researcher may discover.

After several rounds of communication with Bugcrowd and explaining my rationale, eventually my code of conduct point was deducted with an apology.

Once Kape could see that disclosure was not going to go through Bugcrowd, the dialogue at this point between us was more inline with what I would usually experience. We agreed a way forward, disclosure would remain private until a fix was ready, and a fix was released.

In fairness to Kape, the fix was swift in comparison with other disclosure experiences in the past. I just wish that software vendors would offer direct disclosure routes in addition to bug bounty platforms. Some researchers would prefer the direct approach.

Rant over.

### Statement from Kape / CyberGhost

Kape’s Security Team provided the following statement in thanks for the work we performed:

“Kape values collaboration and cooperation with security researchers throughout the world, and we invest heavily in ensuring security researchers are heard and that the lines of communication with our security and development teams are always open. We are sorry that you have had this experience with us on Bugcrowd and we are following up with the relevant parties at Bugcrowd so this doesn’t happen again. At the same time, we are delighted with the research performed by Pen Test Partners into our Windows application, and thank you for your efforts to improve the cybersecurity landscape for all. Collaboration in the cybersecurity community is critical to ensure security and privacy on the internet, and we will continue to act quickly once any valid issue has been reported to us, regardless of how the issue is reported. In this spirit, we are committed to continued transparency and partnership with all researchers who are focused on responsible disclosure.”

### CVE-2023-30237

Like many VPN providers, CyberGhost software uses solutions such as OpenVPN or Wireguard to offer VPN services to their customers.  Most of these VPN solutions are typically split across an unprivileged UI component that communicates with a privileged Windows service running as SYSTEM.  If it’s not fully scrutinized it can lead to elevation of privilege vulnerabilities via this communications channel.

When a request is made to connect to the configured city or country via the unprivileged UI, the details are sent to the backed service and eventually the OpenVPN or Wireguard process is started to establish the underlying VPN connection.

In CyberGhost’s case, this communication is done over a named pipe called **MachineNameCyberGhost8Service**, where machine name is obviously the name of the machine the service is running on.  The developers have clearly made sure that the pipe is not accessible over the network, since the NETWORK principal has a deny ACL set, therefore only local privilege escalation would be possible.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-1.png)

It was found that connecting to the pipe would fail if the client did not originate from the Dashboard.exe process within the CyberGhost installation folder, but this could easily be bypassed via replacing the process name inside the connecting client’s Process Environment Block structure to match that of the legitimate process, or alternatively injecting code into the legitimate Dashboard.exe directly.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-2.png)

Next it was time to look at the communication protocol and how it worked.  Luckily for me, both the client and service were written in .NET, so the job was far easier than a native counterpart.  The RPC communication method was JSON and looked like initially that perhaps an immediate Remote Code Execution could be possible.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-3.png)

As you can see from the format, the direct C# interfaces from the services are exposed and the parameters for a specific method use the often abused **$type** specifier when deserialising using **JsonSerializer** from the Newtonsoft library.  But once again, the developers had done their due diligence and **JsonSerializer** was configured correctly and prevented arbitrary .NET types from being created during JSON deserialization.

With that path exhausted, attention shifted to the callable methods themselves.  The **ConnectToVpnServer** method was the most interesting, as this was the method that led to the construction of the command line string that was fed to openvpn.exe or the wireguard DLL, depending on which method was currently configured.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-4.png)

This eventually let me to a class called **OpenVPN** and **CommandSanitizeHelpers**.  Once again, evidence was found where developers had put efforts in place, this time to prevent command line injection.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-5.png)

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-6.png)

There are several openvpn command line arguments that can be used to execute other processes or load arbitrary DLL’s such as the **–plugin** argument.

If any of these are detected, the resulting openvpn.exe process creation is prevented.

### Inception

Now this is where things start to get interesting.  Once the backend service constructs the monolithic command line string argument that will be used, they are parsed using the native Windows API **CommandLineToArgvW****.** This function is responsible for breaking up a single command line string into each unique argument as an array.  Each element within the array representing a single argument.  Spaces are treated as argument delimiters unless quoted, in which case, the complete argument is the text inside the quotes.  But, if you want the API to include a double quote within an argument itself, you can escape the quote using the \ character.  So as an example, the command line **arg1 “arg 2” “arg \””** will be parsed into an array that looks like this.

**arg1****arg 2****arg 3”**

Notice the parsed elements within the array do not have any quotes and have been stripped, other than what was requested with the escape sequence.

Once the CyberGhost service has broken up the individual command line arguments, each of these starting with the characters **—** are checked for the banned values.  Now the developers clearly missed some nuances of the **CommandLineToArgvW** API.

The command line **-\”-plugin\” c:\path\malicious.dll** would result in a parsed array looking something like this

**-“-plugin”**

**c:\path\malicious.dll**

Since there is a quote separating the two **—** characters, the processing rules by the CyberGhost service ignore these arguments and treat them as openvpn argument values instead of argument specifiers.  Now one would think that this is fine since openvpn would not recognise this as a valid argument, but, the majority of Windows processes also use the same **CommandLineToArgvW** API to split the command line into individual parts prior to calling the **main(int argc, char\*\*argv)** function.  Since the quote is not separated by spaces, the **CommandLineToArgVW** API call simply strips the quote out of the argument.  Therefore

**openvpn.exe -“-plugin” c:\path\malicious.dll**

will execute in in the same way as

**openvpn.exe –plugin c:\path\malicious.dll**

on Windows based platforms.

### Payload

The final payload that is sent over the named pipe looks something like this.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2023/05/cybertoast-7.png)

You’ll notice that most of the command line injection is built into the **ServerIp** field.  This is because the **ServerIp** field is the first field that is concatenated when the command line string is being constructed.  This is then proceeded by internal command line arguments that are added such as the CA server certificate, then finally the remaining **ConnectionString** field is appended to the end.  By leveraging the **ServerIp** field, we had far more control over the final command line that was sent to openvpn.exe.  Had the developers sanitised the **ServerIp** field for a valid IP address only, I’m not sure if exploitation would have been possible.  It certainly would have been more difficult.  The final command line argument that was eventually fed to openvpn looked something like this.

**openvpn –remote “powershell -ec AAA….” –“-plugin “c:\path\CyberGhostPlugin.dll” –dev tap0**

The reason that the **ConnectionString** JSON property string is missing from the command line is due to the subtle fact that we embedded a null character at the end of the **ServerIp** field within the JSON payload.  This meant that even though it was concatenated in the C# code, by the time it reached the **CommandLineToArgVW** API call, the null character was treated as end of string, allowing greater control over the final generated command line since we also could exclude anything from the **ConnectionString** property.

The exploit leverages openvpn’s plugin feature to gain code execution, therefore a simple plugin was written that queried the **–remote** argument and treated this as a command to execute instead.

## What Is a VPN?

A VPN, meaning a virtual private network, creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. A VPN service [encrypts your traffic](/features/vpn-encryption), protects your digital privacy by masking your IP address, and helps you stay safe on public Wi-Fi networks.

No one likes snooping, tracking, and censorship. Thatâs why itâs important to use a VPN every time you go online. Encryption prevents governments, advertisers, ISPs, and cybercriminals from collecting and sharing your personal data.

Consider a VPN the definition of an easy-to-use encryption tool designed to safeguard your digital identity.

![What Is a VPN?]()

![Superior VPN Network]()

## Superior VPN Network

Is your VPN equipped with the best configuration to enjoy blazing-fast speeds and maximum security? If not, itâs time to switch teams.

A reliable VPN architecture includes top-notch hardware, server infrastructure, and protocols. CyberGhost VPN has invested in the latest hardware, and employs best-in-class [VPN protocols](/features/vpn-encryption): WireGuardÂ®, OpenVPN, and IKEv2.

Go for the lightweight WireGuardÂ® protocol to surf the internet at full speed and rely on OpenVPN for pesky network restrictions. IKEv2, which is based on the IP Security Architecture (IPSec) open framework, also gives you reliable, fast connections. Switch between our protocols to suit your needs.

Our 10 Gbps servers can easily handle 4K streaming without buffering or lag. All servers have unlimited bandwidth as we never impose caps on your connection.

## How Does a VPN Work

A VPN works by masking your IP address and rerouting your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel. To understand how a VPN works in your favor, first check what happens if you go online without one.

**What happens if you donât use a VPN?**

Without a VPN, your IP address and internet traffic are visible to anyone interested in snooping on your personal information. Cybercriminals can easily steal your passwords, usernames, and financial transactions on public Wi-Fi.

Your internet freedom is also under attack when dealing with censorship and network blocks. System administrators can deny access to your favorite services (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram).

**What happens if you use a VPN?**

With a VPN, your IP address changes which helps keep you more anonymous. Your internet data is protected with strong encryption as soon as you connect to a VPN server.

Your online traffic goes through a secure, private tunnel that no one can access. Not even your ISP, cyber attackers, government authorities, or network administrators. This leaves you free to experience the internet as itâs meant to be â without restrictions.

## Are VPNs Legal?

VPNs are legal in most parts of the world. Individual people, governments, and corporations use VPNs to protect sensitive information and prevent cyber attacks.

However, in countries with highly restrictive internet laws, you might only be allowed to use government-approved VPNs. It's always best to check local laws and regulations before traveling to a new country.

Note: We disallow using CyberGhost VPN to break the law. Illegal activity is still illegal, even if youâre under the protection of a VPN.

## How to Choose the Best VPN for Yourself

## Can I Use a Free VPN?

Free VPNs impose limits on your bandwidth, resulting in slow speeds, endless buffering, and connection errors. They also have very few servers, so you might not even be able to connect to your chosen location. Free VPNs lack robust security settings, which puts your online data at risk. Thereâs also no support team to assist with troubleshooting.

Without a VPN, your IP address and internet traffic are visible to anyone interested in snooping on your personal information, including your ISP. This can include your browsing history, IP address, and other identifying information. Free VPNs may monetize your internet traffic by injecting targeted ads and spam into your browser, some of which can infect your device with malware.

A premium paid VPN service like CyberGhost gives you lighting-fast server connections, without any bandwidth caps. It secures all your internet traffic with strong encryption. It also has a 24/7 [Customer Support](https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us) team available via live chat and email.

## FAQ

#### Does a VPN make you anonymous?

No VPN service can make you 100% anonymous online. In fact, thereâs no software application that can guarantee such a thing.

CyberGhost VPN helps you browse the web with increased privacy, security, and anonymity. It prevents trackers from logging your IP address and snoopers from gathering details about your digital identity. If you look for extra privacy and security, you should use a VPN.

You can even pay anonymously for CyberGhost VPN using Bitcoin via BitPay. The only information you need to provide is an email address. This means, you never have to give up any personally identifiable information.

#### What does it mean to be a No Logs VPN?

A No Logs VPN means that a VPN service doesnât keep usage logs. In other words, your virtual private network provider doesnât log any information transmitted through the network.

CyberGhost VPN has a strict [No Logs policy](/features/no-logs-vpn), ensuring we donât track, store, or give away any information on your online activity. We also underwent an independent audit. Professionals from Deloitte inspected our VPN servers and management systems, and concluded that we store no user data.

Go for a VPN that operates in jurisdictions without compulsory data retention laws. CyberGhost VPN is headquartered in Romania, a country with strong privacy laws.

#### Does a VPN slow down my internet connection?

A VPN can slow down your internet connection because your internet traffic is routed through a remote VPN server and encrypted.

However, CyberGhost VPN is engineered to mitigate speed loss. We have ultra-fast servers in 100 countries, and provide unlimited bandwidth. Connect to next-gen 10 Gbps servers in all our most popular locations and enjoy speedy, reliable protocols like WireGuardÂ®, OpenVPN, and IKEv2.

#### What is the average cost of a VPN?

On average, VPNs cost about $10 per month, but the prices may vary as much as $20 and as little as $3 per month. If you commit to a yearly VPN subscription, you can reap the rewards of bigger discounts.

Some VPNs allow you to try the service for free. CyberGhost VPN lets you test the full-featured version of the VPN without any limitations. Enjoy a 24-hour free trial for Windows and macOS, 3-day free trial for Android, and 7-day free trial for iOS.
Our [45-day money-back guarantee](/buy) also gives you plenty of time to test our VPN service risk-free.

#### Can I be tracked using a VPN?

There is no way to track encrypted VPN traffic. As soon as you connect to a [VPN server](/vpn-server), your online traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel that no one has access to. Not even your ISP, government agencies, trackers, or cybercriminals. Your IP address also remains concealed from prying eyes.

That said, keep in mind that no VPN service can help you become completely anonymous and untraceable online. Think about how many details you enter when you create an online account. Some websites ask for your name, address, gender, date of birth, and payment information.

#### Should I always leave my VPN on?

Yes, you should leave your VPN on at all times to protect yourself against snooping and bypass censorship. A VPN service works in the background without affecting other applications you work with.

Always keep your VPN on to surf safely on public Wi-Fi, thwart cyber attacks, prevent your ISP from monetizing your internet traffic, and securely access websites censored in parts of the world.

#### Can I use a VPN on any device?

Yes, you can use a VPN on any device to stay safe and private every time you go online. Just ensure your VPN provider offers apps compatible with all your favorite devices.
When you subscribe to CyberGhost VPN, all your devices can use a VPN: [iPhones](/download/ios-vpn), [Android phones](/download/android-vpn), [Windows](/download/windows-vpn) and [Mac](/download/macos-vpn) laptops, games consoles, and Smart TVs. Just 1 CyberGhost subscription lets you connect up to 7 devices at once. If you need to cover all your home devices, simply put CyberGhost VPN on your router.

#### How do I get a VPN on my Chromebook for school?

You have three options to get CyberGhost VPN on your Chromebook:

The first one requires you to download and install the CyberGhost VPN Android application from the Google Play store. This secures your entire internet traffic.

For the second method, you need to install the CyberGhost Chrome extension on your web browser from the Google Chrome Web Store. This option only secures the internet traffic on the Chrome browser, and wonât safeguard your online activities outside it.

The third choice has you setting up CyberGhost VPN on your router to protect all devices in your household, including your Chromebook.
