Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-30530:

**CVE-2023-30530**

*   **Root Cause:** The Consul KV Builder Plugin stores the HashiCorp Consul ACL Token in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the token is not masked in the global configuration form.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** The Consul ACL token is stored unencrypted in the `org.jenkinsci.plugins.consulkv.GlobalConsulConfig.xml` file.
    *   **Lack of Masking:** The token is displayed in plain text within the global configuration form.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the unencrypted token. Also, the lack of masking increases the potential for attackers to observe and capture the token through the configuration form. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Consul Key-Value store if the ACL token is still valid.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the configuration file containing the unencrypted token.
    *   **Configuration Form:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins configuration form can observe the unmasked token.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the `org.jenkinsci.plugins.consulkv.GlobalConsulConfig.xml` file.
    *   **Jenkins Access:** Attackers need at least Overall/Read permissions to observe the configuration page via the UI.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-30530 and aligns with the general description of the security issue.
