The provided content is related to CVE-2023-30172.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a local file inclusion issue in the MLflow server. Specifically, the artifact download handler does not properly validate the path parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization of the 'path' parameter in the artifact download handler.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read any file on the server where MLflow is running. This could potentially expose sensitive information, including configuration files, credentials, or other data.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited via the artifact download handler of the MLflow server. The attacker can manipulate the 'path' parameter to specify the location of arbitrary files on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have network access to the MLflow server. The attacker does not need any special privileges and can trigger the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reproduced in MLflow versions 1.26.1 and 1.30.0.
- The fix was introduced in MLflow v2.0.1, and was merged into v2.0.0 as well.
- The vulnerability is fixed by pull request #7170, which validates the 'path' parameter and prevents the LFI.
