{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `gatsby-plugin-sharp` plugin, when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`), did not properly validate file paths, allowing access to files outside the intended project directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or environment variables.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted HTTP request to the Gatsby develop server containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Gatsby develop server, which by default is only accessible via localhost (127.0.0.1). Exploitation from outside the local machine requires intentionally exposing the server to other interfaces (e.g., using `--host 0.0.0.0` or similar options)."

  },
  "fixed_versions": {
    "npm": "gatsby-plugin-sharp 5.8.1 and 4.25.1"
  },
  "patch_details": "The patch mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory. The fix in `gatsby-node.js` checks if a file exists at the resolved path and only serves it if it's a result of a deferred job (lazy image processing) and within the allowed directory structure. Additionally, tests were added to verify the fix.",
