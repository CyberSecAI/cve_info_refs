- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user inputs that may affect file paths. This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through user supplied input that is used to construct file paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to supply malicious file path input to the application.
