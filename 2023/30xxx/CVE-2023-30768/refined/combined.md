**Summary:**

Intel is releasing mitigations for a privilege escalation issue. This issue affects the UEFI BIOS of select Intel Products. The issue identified is a method that enables malicious code to gain access to System Management Mode (SMM).

**Description:**

A malicious attacker with local administrative access can leverage the vulnerable function to gain access to System Management Mode (SMM) and take full control of the platform. Intel products that are listed below should apply the update.

Other vendors’ products which use the common BIOS function SmmRuntime may be impacted.  To find out whether a product you have may be vulnerable to this issue, please contact your system supplier.

The table below provides the list of Intel products impacted by the issue as well as the versions and the locations of the BIOS that contains the fix. If the customer system has BIOS version lower than one listed in the table customer is recommended to upgrade the BIOS to the version listed below, or later.

How to identify Intel® Server Boards model and BIOS version?

To identify the server board model and the BIOS version customer can use one of the methods below.

1. For server systems running Microsoft Windows\* operating systems, [download and run the Intel® System Support Utility](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25293) and view

Detailed View – Computer – BIOS Version/Date

Detailed View – Computer – System Model

The utility will generate an output file with computer system information. The BIOS version and the board model should look like this:

BIOS Version/Date            Intel Corporation SE5C610.86B.01.01.0008.021120151325 , 02/11/2015 12:00 AM

System Model                    S2600WT2

2.  For server systems running Linux operating system customers should execute the commands below to obtain the BIOS version and the Board model respectively:

dmidecode -t 0 | grep Version | awk -F : '{ print $2 }' | sed s/\ //g

dmidecode -t 2 | grep Product | awk -F : '{ print $2 }' | sed s/\ //g

The first command will return the line of text similar to this:

SE5C610.86B.01.01.0016.033120161139

The second command will return the line of text similar to this:

S2600WTT

In this example the commands were executed on the Intel® Server Board S2600WTT belonging to the Intel® Server Board S2600WT Family with the BIOS version 0016.
