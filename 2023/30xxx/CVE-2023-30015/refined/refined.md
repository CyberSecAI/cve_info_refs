Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `txtsearch` parameter in the `/php-jms/review_search.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection. User-supplied input to the `txtsearch` parameter is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input received via the `txtsearch` parameter.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly incorporates the user-supplied input into the SQL query without using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g. `database()`), such as the database name, as demonstrated in the provided payload. It can also be used to read other arbitrary database information by adjusting the query used in the exploit payload.
*   **Data Manipulation:** More advanced SQL injection payloads can be used to modify or delete data in the database, potentially causing significant damage.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** If the database credentials are also stored in the database the SQL injection may lead to full compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/php-jms/review_search.php` with a crafted `txtsearch` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax in order to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/php-jms/review_search.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `txtsearch`
*   **Exploit Payload:**
    ```
    txtsearch=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+'%--+
    ```
    This payload utilizes the `updatexml` function for error-based SQL injection to reveal the database name. The payload exploits the lack of input sanitization to inject malicious SQL into the query being run on the database.
