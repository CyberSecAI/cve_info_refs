Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in `SQLi-1.md`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) in the "Judging Management System v1.0" application.
- The vulnerability is located in the `review_result.php` file, specifically in the `mainevent_id` parameter within the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `mainevent_id` parameter.
- The application is using the `updatexml` function in conjunction with a `select` query, which allows an attacker to extract data from the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
- In the provided payload, the attacker is able to extract the database name.
- Further exploitation can lead to other impacts such as data modification or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `review_result.php` file.
- The `mainevent_id` parameter in the URL is modified to include a malicious SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely, via the web interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific payload used is: `/php-jms/review_result.php?mainevent_id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
- The payload utilizes the `updatexml` function which, when used improperly, can be used to extract data.
- The payload uses the `concat` function to concatenate a tilde (0x7e) with the result of the `select database()` query, which will leak the current database name.
- The `--+` comments out the rest of the SQL query.
- The database name is `jms_db`.
- The application is built using XAMPP with PHP 8.1.
