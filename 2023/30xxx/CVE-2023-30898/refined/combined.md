SUMMARY

Both the Event Server and the Management Server components of Siveillance Video deserialize data
without sufﬁcient validations. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute code on the
affected system.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
The provided cumulative hotﬁx releases include the ﬁxes for both Event Server (ES) and Management
Server (MS). Ensure to apply the ﬁxes on all relevant servers in your deployment.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siveillance Video (formerly called Siveillance VMS) is a powerful IP video management software designed
for deployments ranging from small and simple to large-scale and high-security. The Siveillance Video
portfolio consists of four versions, Siveillance Video Core, Core Plus, Advanced, and Pro, addressing the
speciﬁc needs of small and medium size solutions up to large complex deployments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
