The provided content is related to CVE-2023-30581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the use of `__proto__` in `process.mainModule.__proto__.require()`, which bypasses the intended policy mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is present in the experimental policy mechanism in Node.js. The use of `__proto__` allows requiring modules that are not defined in the `policy.json` file, thus violating the policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass the intended restrictions imposed by the experimental policy mechanism, potentially allowing them to load arbitrary modules and execute code that should otherwise be blocked.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the use of `process.mainModule.__proto__.require()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within a Node.js environment that has the experimental policy mechanism enabled. They need to be able to manipulate the module loading process and use the `__proto__` property to bypass the intended security.
