| Hello, I tried to reproduce the problem but when following you instructions on the build step with clang and the adress-sanitizer I ran into the following problem:  ``` usr/bin/ld: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start': (.text+0x17): undefined reference to `main' clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1  ``` |
