Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-30414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `vm_loop` component of JerryScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `vm_loop` function within the `/jerry-core/vm/vm.c` file of the JerryScript project.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific JavaScript code pattern involving recursive function calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service due to a stack overflow causing the program to crash.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.
- Exploitation results in a high impact on availability, while confidentiality and integrity are not affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, implying the attacker would need local access to execute the malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted JavaScript code, which triggers the recursive function pattern, on a system running the vulnerable JerryScript version.
- User interaction is required, implying the user must execute the crafted javascript code.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Jerryscript commit `1a2c047`.
- The provided issue link contains the sample JavaScript code that triggers the stack overflow.
- A backtrace shows the crash occurring within the `vm_loop` function.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow due to unbounded recursion, requiring an attacker to provide a specially crafted JavaScript program and execute it via JerryScript. The result of the overflow is a program crash.
