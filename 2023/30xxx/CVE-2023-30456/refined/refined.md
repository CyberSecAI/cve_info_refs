      "root_cause": "A flaw in the KVM implementation for Intel CPUs affecting nested virtualization. Specifically when KVM is used as L0 hypervisor and EPT and/or unrestricted guest mode is disabled, it does not prevent an L2 guest from being configured with an architecturally invalid protection/paging mode.",

        "Improper restriction of operations within a nested virtualization environment.",

        "Exploiting a flaw in the KVM implementation, by manipulating the nested virtualization configuration.",
