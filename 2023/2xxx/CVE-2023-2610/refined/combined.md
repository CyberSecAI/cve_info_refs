Package        : vim
Version        : 2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-4141 CVE-2023-0054 CVE-2023-1175 CVE-2023-2610
Debian Bug     : 1027146 1031875 1035955

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
vi editor. Buffer overflows and out-of-bounds reads may lead to a
denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
