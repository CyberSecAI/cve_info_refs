Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2558

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the `wpcs_current_currency` shortcode of the WPCS – WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input within the `wpcs_current_currency` shortcode, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode.
*   When a user accesses the compromised page, the injected script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the attributes of the `wpcs_current_currency` shortcode.
*   **Stored XSS:**  The malicious code is stored within the WordPress database and is executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level privileges within the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Insert Shortcodes:** The attacker needs the ability to add or modify content using shortcodes within WordPress pages/posts.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in WPCS – WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin versions up to and including 1.1.9.
* The fix was implemented in version 1.2.0 by properly escaping the output of the `wpcs_current_currency` shortcode.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Alex Thomas from Wordfence.

**Summary:**

The WPCS – WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin had a stored XSS vulnerability due to improper handling of user input in the `wpcs_current_currency` shortcode. An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions could inject arbitrary JavaScript, leading to potential site compromise and malicious activity execution within users' browsers. The fix involves escaping the output of the shortcode, and users should update to version 1.2.0 or higher.
