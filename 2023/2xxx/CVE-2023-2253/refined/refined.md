Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-2253:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/v2/_catalog` endpoint of the `distribution/distribution` component. This endpoint accepts a parameter 'n' in the query string, which controls the maximum number of records returned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the value of the 'n' parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an excessively large value.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't limit the maximum size or value of 'n', leading to an oversized string array allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a large value for 'n', an attacker can trigger the allocation of a massive string array. This leads to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious API Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted API request to the `/v2/_catalog` endpoint, which includes an unreasonably large value for the 'n' parameter in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the affected service to send malicious API requests.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker should know the endpoint and the parameter being used.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects the `distribution/distribution` component.
- The issue was fixed in `distribution 2.8.2`
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 and OADP-1.1-RHEL-8 via errata RHSA-2023:4091, RHSA-2023:5155, RHSA-2023:5390 and RHSA-2023:5697
- Debian LTS also released a fix for `docker-registry` in version `2.6.2~ds1-2+deb10u1` as DLA-3473-1.
