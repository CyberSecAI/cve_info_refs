- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape some of its settings, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through the plugin's settings page where the user can input text into the "Title" and "Type Value" fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the plugin's settings page and inject the malicious script.
