Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2836

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The CRM Perks Forms plugin for WordPress versions 1.1.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when rendering form settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the form settings, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database. This code is executed when a user accesses a page where the injected form settings are rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim user's browser session.
*   **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal the victim's cookies by injecting JavaScript that sends the cookie information to a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, an attacker may be able to impersonate the victim user and gain unauthorized access to the WordPress site.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform any actions on the victim's behalf, depending on their permissions within the application.
    * Redirection to malicious sites.
    * Data theft or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability can be triggered through the admin panel where form settings can be modified.
*   **URL manipulation:**  The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing an XSS payload. The payload is triggered when the user hovers the mouse over the left menu of the plugin's admin page.
*   **Stored Payload:** The malicious script is stored within the database and is rendered each time the vulnerable page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrator-level (or higher) permissions on the WordPress site to access the plugin's settings and inject the malicious scripts.
*   **Multi-site or unfiltered_html:**  The Wordfence article specifies that this vulnerability is present on multi-site installations or when unfiltered_html has been disabled

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `templates/sidebar.php` and `templates/step1.php` files, where user-supplied data is not properly escaped before being outputted in the HTML.
*   The attacker can inject a payload within the URL parameters that gets reflected in the HTML source code and executes JavaScript code.
*   The "+" character needs to be URL encoded to %2B for the payload to execute successfully because "+" is filtered in one of the code sections.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

1.  An attacker with admin privileges logs into the WordPress admin panel.
2.  The attacker navigates to the CRM Perks Forms settings page.
3.  The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes an XSS payload using an `onmouseover` event and injects this into a URL which is then reflected in the web page.
4.  When the victim user hovers their mouse over the left menu of the plugin's admin page. The attacker's malicious script is executed within the userâ€™s browser.
5.  The attacker can then steal cookies or perform any other malicious actions.

**Remediation:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.2 of the plugin, which introduced output escaping on the affected code sections.
*   Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or later to mitigate the risk.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and how to remediate it.
