- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard when the WPML plugin is active and configured.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `page` parameter. The user, typically an administrator, is tricked into visiting this URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in administrator into opening it in their browser. The WPML plugin must also be active and configured for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
