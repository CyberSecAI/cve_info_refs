- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service. In this case, the provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, using `sleep(20)` to verify the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `orderby` and `order` parameters in the `GET` request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` page, specifically when the `page` parameter is set to `querywall`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to access the vulnerable page.
