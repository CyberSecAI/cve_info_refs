Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2297:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly discusses CVE-2023-2297 and its relation to an insecure password reset mechanism in the Profile Builder WordPress plugin.

**2. Root Cause:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of the native WordPress password reset functionality, specifically the `wppb_front_end_password_recovery` function, which uses the plaintext value of a password reset key instead of a hashed value. This allows for easy retrieval and subsequent use of the key to reset user passwords.
   - The function `wppb_front_end_password_recovery()` directly queries the user by using the plaintext activation key (`SELECT * FROM $wpdb->users WHERE user_activation_key = %s`).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insecure Password Reset:** The plugin retrieves and uses the user activation key directly from the database without proper hashing during the password reset process. This contrasts with the core WordPress functionality, where the key is hashed and compared to the database.
   - **Information Disclosure (related to CVE-2023-0814):** While not the direct cause, the content mentions CVE-2023-0814, a separate vulnerability in the same plugin which allows retrieving the `user_activation_key` via the `user_meta` shortcode. This information disclosure facilitates exploitation of the password reset vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Account Takeover:** An attacker can use the retrieved activation key to reset the password of any user, including administrators, leading to privilege escalation and complete account takeover.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Password Reset Form:** The attacker initiates the password reset process through the `[wppb-recover-password]` shortcode, which sends an email with a password reset link.
   - **User Meta Shortcode and admin-ajax.php:** The attacker leverages the `[user_meta]` shortcode and the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint to retrieve the `user_activation_key`.
   - **Password Reset Page:** The attacker accesses the password reset page by using the `key` parameter in the URL to reset the password.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site to exploit the information disclosure vulnerability via `admin-ajax.php`.
   - **Access to Password Reset Form:** The attacker needs access to the password reset form of the vulnerable plugin.
   - **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and the means to exploit it, often leveraging CVE-2023-0814 to obtain the `user_activation_key`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `user_activation_key` is stored in plaintext in the database which is not a good practice.
- The `wppb_front_end_password_recovery` function doesn't properly validate the password reset key before changing the user password.
- The fix includes:
    -  The `usermeta.php` shortcode handler now prevents retrieval of the `user_pass` and `user_activation_key` fields via the `user_meta` shortcode.
    - The password reset functionality now uses the built-in `get_password_reset_key` function.
