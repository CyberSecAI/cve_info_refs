This document details multiple vulnerabilities in an Online Computer and Laptop Store application.

**1. XSS Vulnerability in `products.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly reflects user-supplied input from the `search` parameter in the HTML output without proper sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By crafting a malicious URL with a `<script>` tag in the `search` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link, or embed this link in another website.

**2. SQL Injection Vulnerability in `products.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input from the `c` and `s` parameters in SQL queries.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive database information, bypass authentication, or modify data.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection payloads in the `c` and `s` parameters.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests.

**3. SQL Injection Vulnerability in `view_product.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input from the `id` parameter in an SQL query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*  **Impact:** Similar to the previous SQL injection, this allows an attacker to extract sensitive database information, bypass authentication, or modify data.
*  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection payloads in the `id` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests.

**4. SQL Injection Vulnerability in `view_categories.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input from the `c` and `s` parameters in an SQL query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the previous SQL injections, this allows an attacker to extract sensitive database information, bypass authentication, or modify data.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection payloads in the `c` and `s` parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests.

**5. SQL Injection Vulnerability in `./classes/Master.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input from the `id` parameter in a SQL query within the `delete_category` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the previous SQL injections, this allows an attacker to extract sensitive database information, bypass authentication, or modify data.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a POST request with a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter when calling the `delete_category` function.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
