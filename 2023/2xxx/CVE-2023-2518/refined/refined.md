```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page when the debug option is enabled.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a high-privilege user's session, such as an administrator.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `sql_error` parameter when the debug setting is enabled and tricking an admin to open the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the debug option enabled and needs to trick a logged in admin to open a crafted URL.
