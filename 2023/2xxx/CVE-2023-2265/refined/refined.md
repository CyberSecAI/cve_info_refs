**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly restrict how UI layers or frames are rendered, leading to a clickjacking vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform clickjacking attacks against an authenticated and authorized user. This could lead to the user unintentionally performing actions they did not intend to, by tricking them into clicking on obscured elements on a page.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker would craft a malicious web page that overlays or frames the legitimate SEL-411L interface, tricking the user into interacting with the hidden page elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They require the ability to trick an authenticated user into visiting the malicious page.
