Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `submit_ticket` function in the Groundhogg plugin lacked proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `submit_ticket` function did not verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform the action, specifically the `create_users` capability.
- **Missing nonce verification:** The AJAX actions did not verify the nonce, allowing for CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:**  Authenticated attackers could submit a support ticket that sends sensitive website data to the plugin developer. This data includes:
    - Plugin settings and configurations
    - System information
    - Potentially sensitive data included in the ticket message.
- **Admin Account Creation:** The vulnerability could be used to create an administrator account with an auto-login link. This link, along with the login URL, would be sent to the plugin developer, potentially granting them unauthorized access to the site.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low privileges could potentially create a new admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests, making it accessible from anywhere on the network if the site is accessible.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site, with any role including subscriber.
- **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_groundhogg_submit_support_ticket` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
- The attacker does not need any specific elevated privileges on the site.
- The attacker needs to send crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The Groundhogg plugin must be activated with a valid license for the admin user creation to work.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Groundhogg plugin versions up to 2.7.9.8.
- The issue was resolved in version 2.7.10 by adding capability checks and nonce verification to the `submit_ticket` function and other AJAX actions.
