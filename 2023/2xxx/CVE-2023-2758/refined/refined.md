Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-2758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an inadequate process for restricting illegitimate, repetitive authentication attempts. Specifically, a time-zone mismatch between PHP and PostgreSQL configurations can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper control of interaction frequency (CWE-799):** The system does not properly manage the frequency of login attempts, allowing an attacker to exploit a time-zone discrepancy to block legitimate logins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unauthenticated remote attacker can prevent legitimate users from logging into the Contec CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) from specific IP addresses. This login denial can last for hours, and the attacker can repeat the attack to extend the DoS period.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need prior credentials to exploit this vulnerability and can launch the attack remotely.
- **Manipulated HTTP Headers:** The attacker sends HTTP requests with a manipulated `X-Forwarded-For` header and invalid login credentials, targeting the login page (`/php/login.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of the target's login page**: The attacker needs to know the URL of the affected application's login page.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Time Zone Mismatch:** The vulnerability relies on differing time zone configurations between PHP and PostgreSQL on the server. Specifically, setting "date.timezone" to "UTC" in `php.ini` and "America/New_York" in PostgreSQL is mentioned as a way to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to block login attempts from `localhost` by sending requests with the crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header.
*   **Affected Products:** Contec CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) version 3.5.2 and prior.
*   **Vendor Remediation:** The vendor has released version 3.5.3 that fixes this vulnerability.

This information provides a good overview of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it can be exploited. It also points out the necessary configurations and conditions needed for a successful attack.
