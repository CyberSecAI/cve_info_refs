- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SupportCandy plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `id` parameter within the REST API when retrieving agent data, before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided proof of concept shows that a time-based SQL injection can be used to confirm the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible through the plugin's REST API endpoint, specifically `/wp-json/supportcandy/v2/agents/`. The `id` parameter within the URL is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with a role as low as a "Subscriber" can exploit this vulnerability.
