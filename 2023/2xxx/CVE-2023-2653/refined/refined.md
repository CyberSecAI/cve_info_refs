The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the "Lost and Found Information System" version 1.0.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Unsanitized input in the `cid` parameter of `/items/index.php` is directly used in an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
