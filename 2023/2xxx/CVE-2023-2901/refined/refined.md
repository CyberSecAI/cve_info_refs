Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `User-GetGridJson` function of the NFine rapid development platform. Specifically, this function allows unauthenticated access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary vulnerability is that the `GetGridJson` function can be accessed without any authentication or authorization checks. This allows any user to retrieve sensitive user data from the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve user data, including potentially sensitive information, such as user names, creation times, and other grid-related data, that was intended to be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/SystemManage/User/GetGridJson` with specific parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. This could be from within the same network as the server or remotely if the server is exposed to the internet.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials, making this vulnerability easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a sample request and screenshots of successful responses, illustrating the vulnerability.
*   The lack of authentication on the `/SystemManage/User/GetGridJson` endpoint is the core issue.
*  The vulnerability is present in the NFine rapid development platform.
