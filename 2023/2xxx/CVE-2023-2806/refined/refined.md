{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the \"泛微e-cology\" system's XML parser handles external entities when processing requests to the `/rest/ofs/RequestInfoByXml` path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read sensitive files from the system, including configuration files containing passwords, usernames, and other sensitive details. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as the attacker could potentially modify or delete sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious XML request to the `/rest/ofs/RequestInfoByXml` path with an external entity reference pointing to a file on the system."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit XML requests to the `/rest/ofs/RequestInfoByXml` path. No other specific capabilities are mentioned."
