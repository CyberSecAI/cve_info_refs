netdevsim: fib: Fix reference count leak on route deletion failure

```
As part of FIB offload simulation, netdevsim stores IPv4 and IPv6 routes
and holds a reference on FIB info structures that in turn hold a
reference on the associated nexthop device(s).

In the unlikely case where we are unable to allocate memory to process a
route deletion request, netdevsim will not release the reference from
the associated FIB info structure, thereby preventing the associated
nexthop device(s) from ever being removed [1].

Fix this by scheduling a work item that will flush netdevsim's FIB table
upon route deletion failure. This will cause netdevsim to release its
reference from all the FIB info structures in its table.

Reported by Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2189137#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-04-24 10:55:33 UTC  ``` A reference count issue was found in the Linux kernel's netdevsim device driver. Quoting ZDI security advisory [1]:  "This vulnerability allows local attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the scheduling of events. The issue results from the improper management of a reference count. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system."  [1] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-17811/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2189137#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-04-24 12:49:27 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/180a6a3ee60a>   ``` |  |
