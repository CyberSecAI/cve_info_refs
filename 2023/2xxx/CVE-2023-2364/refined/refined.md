The content provided is related to CVE-2023-2364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on the registration page of the "Resort Reservation System". User-provided data submitted through `registration.php` is not sanitized and is directly reflected in `users.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected through the registration form and stored in the database. This script is then executed when an administrator views the user list on the `users.php` page.
- Unauthenticated Stored XSS:  An attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker can steal the administrator's session cookies, gaining full access to the application with admin privileges.
- Data theft: Sensitive information like login credentials, financial information, and personal information can be stolen.
- Account takeover: Attackers can take full control of an admin's account and perform any authorized actions.
- Further attacks: The stored XSS can be used to launch more advanced attacks, like phishing, malware distribution, or DDoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the registration page (`registration.php`).
- An attacker registers a new user using a crafted payload that includes a malicious script within the `fullname` field (or other vulnerable fields) using a POST request.
- This malicious payload is stored in the database and is displayed to administrators on the users page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication to inject the malicious payload. They simply need access to the application's registration page.
-  The attacker does require an administrator to log in and view the users page to trigger the stored XSS.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) with the specific payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability: `<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`.
- The content also provides a recommendation to remediate the vulnerability by using `htmlspecialchars` and `strip_tags` on user input before displaying it on the users page.
