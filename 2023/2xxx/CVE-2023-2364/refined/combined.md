# Resort Reservation System - Stored Cross Site Scripting on Registration Page could allow to hijack admin session

### Date:

> 26 April 2023

### CVE Assigned:

**[CVE-2023-2364](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2364)** [mitre.org](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2364) [nvd.nist.org](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2364)

### Author Email:

> navaidnasari@hotmail.co.uk

### Vendor Homepage:

> <https://www.sourcecodester.com>

### Software Link:

> [Resort Reservation System](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16447/resort-reservation-system-php-and-sqlite3-source-code-free-download.html)

### Version:

> v 1.0

### What is Stored Cross-Site Scripting:

> Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.

### Affected Page:

> Vulnerable Page: unvalidated data submitted through registration.php and reflected on users.php

> In this page order parameter is vulnerable to Reflected Cross Site Scripting Attack

### Description:

> The Stored XSS found in registration page and without unauthentication any malicious user could inject the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to hijack the admin session, it is a serious vulnerability that can have a significant impact on the security of a web application and its users. The main risk associated with Unauthenticated Stored XSS is that it can allow an attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of a admin's account on a web application. This can include login credentials, financial information, personal information, and more. Once an attacker gains access to a admin's account, they can perform any actions that the user is authorized to do. In addition, Unauthenticated Stored XSS can also be used as a stepping stone to launch more advanced attacks, such as phishing attacks, malware distribution, or distributed denial-of-service attacks. By gaining control of a admin's account on a web application, an attacker can use that account as a launching point for further attacks against the user or the web application itself.

### Proof of Concept:

> I registered the dummy user to verify the XSS attack, I used standard XSS payload <script>alert(document.cookie);</script> and the Below Image confirmed that, the parameter is vulnerable to stored XSS.

> Payload: <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

> Request:

### Recommendation:

> Whoever uses this CMS, should update line no 40 and 41 of users.php with the following code to avoid cross-site scripting attack:

```
Old Code: <?php echo $_GET['fullname']; ?> and <?php echo $_GET['username']; ?>
New Code: <?php echo htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($_GET['fullname'])); ?> and <?php echo htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($_GET['username'])); ?>

```
