  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `source_branch` of a merge request was being marked as `html_safe` when the merge request was created from a fork. This allowed for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the branch name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
        "CSP bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they viewed the affected merge request. This could lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim, including data theft or account takeover.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could create a malicious branch name that contains XSS payloads, then create a merge request from that branch into another project. When a user views this merge request, the malicious code would be executed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a fork of a project, push a branch with a malicious name to their fork, and create a merge request from that branch into the original project."
