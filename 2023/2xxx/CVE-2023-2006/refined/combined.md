| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2189112#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-04-24 09:26:58 UTC  ``` A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's RxRPC network protocol. Quoting ZDI security advisory [1]:  "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of RxRPC bundles. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel."  [1] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-439/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2189112#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-04-24 09:27:27 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3bcd6c7eaa53>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2189112#c5)  Marc Dionne (Auristor)    2023-04-26 18:59:04 UTC  ``` Note that although this bug is present in the RHEL 9.0 and 9.1 source trees, the rxrpc module for those releases is not built, shipped or supported by Red Hat or AuriStor.  For RHEL 9.2, the rxrpc module will be enabled (partner supported and shipped), but the fix for the CVE has already been applied (see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2170099](show_bug.cgi?id=2170099) and the associated merge request).  So there should not be any RHEL releases that are vulnerable to the issue in this CVE.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2189112#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-04-27 13:14:25 UTC  ``` Thanks Marc, I have updated the flaw bug's metadata accordingly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2189112#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-04-27 18:10:35 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-2006>   ``` |  |

## Linux Kernel RxRPC Race Condition Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-439ZDI-CAN-15975

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-2006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2006) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Kernel |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of RxRPC bundles. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Linux has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

rxrpc: Fix race between conn bundle lookup and bundle removal [ZDI-CA…

…N-15975]

After rxrpc_unbundle_conn() has removed a connection from a bundle, it
checks to see if there are any conns with available channels and, if not,
removes and attempts to destroy the bundle.

Whilst it does check after grabbing client_bundles_lock that there are no
connections attached, this races with rxrpc_look_up_bundle() retrieving the
bundle, but not attaching a connection for the connection to be attached
later.

There is therefore a window in which the bundle can get destroyed before we
manage to attach a new connection to it.

Fix this by adding an "active" counter to struct rxrpc_bundle:

 (1) rxrpc_connect_call() obtains an active count by prepping/looking up a
     bundle and ditches it before returning.

 (2) If, during rxrpc_connect_call(), a connection is added to the bundle,
     this obtains an active count, which is held until the connection is
     discarded.

 (3) rxrpc_deactivate_bundle() is created to drop an active count on a
     bundle and destroy it when the active count reaches 0.  The active
     count is checked inside client_bundles_lock() to prevent a race with
     rxrpc_look_up_bundle().

 (4) rxrpc_unbundle_conn() then calls rxrpc_deactivate_bundle().
