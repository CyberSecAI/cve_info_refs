- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized command-line input used by the Insight Agent, specifically when handling arguments for file operations. This lack of sanitization allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory Traversal. The input from the CLI arguments was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify file paths that could traverse directories.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could write arbitrary files to the system using the unsanitized input.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via command-line arguments passed to the Insight Agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have some level of access to the machine where the Insight Agent is running to execute commands and pass malicious arguments.
