- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `id` parameter of the `view_room.php` page, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `view_room.php` page, specifically in the handling of the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized SQL queries on the database. This could lead to access or modification of sensitive data, or even system takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL `?page=view_room&id=`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low-privileged access (employee role) can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the `id` parameter when viewing the room list.
