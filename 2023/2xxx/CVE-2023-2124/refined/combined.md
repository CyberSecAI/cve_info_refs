Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the
    Linux kernel did not properly handled user-supplied data, resulting
    in a triggerable assertion. An unauthenticated remote attacker can
    take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
    mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3269

    Ruihan Li discovered that incorrect lock handling for accessing and
    updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) may result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
    locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2023-32250 / CVE-2023-32254

    Quentin Minster discovered two race conditions in KSMBD, a kernel
    server which implements the SMB3 protocol, which could result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.37-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

</TASK>
The fuzzed image contains an AGF with an obviously garbage
agf\_refcount\_level value of 32, and a dirty log with a buffer log item
for that AGF. The ondisk AGF has a higher LSN than the recovered log
item. xlog\_recover\_buf\_commit\_pass2 reads the buffer, compares the
LSNs, and decides to skip replay because the ondisk buffer appears to be
newer.
Unfortunately, the ondisk buffer is corrupt, but recovery just read the
buffer with no buffer ops specified:
error = xfs\_buf\_read(mp->m\_ddev\_targp, buf\_f->blf\_blkno,
buf\_f->blf\_len, buf\_flags, &bp, NULL);
Skipping the buffer leaves its contents in memory unverified. This sets
us up for a kernel crash because xfs\_refcount\_recover\_cow\_leftovers
reads the buffer (which is still around in XBF\_DONE state, so no read
verification) and creates a refcountbt cursor of height 32. This is
impossible so we run off the end of the cursor object and crash.
Fix this by invoking the verifier on all skipped buffers and aborting
log recovery if the ondisk buffer is corrupt. It might be smarter to
force replay the log item atop the buffer and then see if it'll pass the
write verifier (like ext4 does) but for now let's go with the
conservative option where we stop immediately.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in the
    KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which may
    allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
    result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
    lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi
    driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit
    this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-2002

Debian Bug     : 871216 1035359 1036543 1044518 1050622

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller

    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver

    A flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device. The security impact of this is unclear.

    Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
    could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference
    when mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.

    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-3389

    A use-after-free in the driver for Siano SMS1xxx based MDTV
    receivers may result in local denial of service.

CVE-2023-4147
