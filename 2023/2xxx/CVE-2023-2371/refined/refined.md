The provided content contains information about a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` GET parameter in `/odjms/admin/inquiries/view_details.php`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- The use of a direct query to the database using the user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract or modify data in the database.
- The provided example shows the ability to perform a union-based SQL injection, allowing the attacker to retrieve data from other tables.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/odjms/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` with a malicious crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication appears necessary in the provided request details.

The content provides detailed information regarding the SQL injection vulnerability, including sample HTTP requests, payloads, and proof of successful exploitation using a union query and a basic logical check.
