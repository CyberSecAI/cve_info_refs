{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to create a tag with a name that includes the `refs/tags/` prefix, bypassing the tag protection mechanism which is designed to restrict tag creation to specific users for tags matching a defined pattern (e.g., `v*`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of tag names during creation.",
      "Incorrect handling of tag references that leads to a bypass of protection rules.",
       "The system falls back to the branch content when a tag reference cannot be resolved, this behaviour is not intended and exposes an attack vector."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create tags with arbitrary names, including those matching protected patterns, even if they lack the required permissions. This could lead to a victim downloading malicious source code associated with the spoofed tag.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface: The attacker uses the 'New tag' functionality in the GitLab web interface to create a tag with a specifically crafted name (e.g., `refs/tags/v1`)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a member of the project with permissions to create branches and tags (but not protected ones). They do not need to have Maintainer role. They need to be able to create a branch. They need to be able to access the Tag creation page and enter the special tag name."
