- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ConvertKit plugin does not properly sanitize a parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. This is especially dangerous if the victim is a high-privilege user such as an administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, will execute the XSS payload. This is achieved by injecting malicious code in the `page` parameter of the settings page URL. The provided PoC demonstrates this using a crafted HTML form that submits the malicious payload when loaded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to open a malicious link or page containing the exploit code.
