## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# AN\_GradeBook <= 5.0.1 - Admin+ XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. When adding a new course in the plugin settings, all fields are vulnerable to XSS with the payload: <script>alert('xss')</script>
2. Enter the payload into any field and reload the page to see XSS.

### Affects Plugins
