- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings fields when adding a new course.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who access those settings pages. This can lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. This is possible even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, within the WordPress site. They then input the malicious payload in the vulnerable fields in the plugin's settings when adding a new course.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or equivalent access to the WordPress site to access the plugin settings.
