- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EtherNet/IP unit's FTP functionality allows unrestricted file uploads, creating a path for malicious actors to upload harmful files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload (CWE-434)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Information disclosure
    - Data modification/tampering
    - Data deletion
    - System destruction
    - Potential launchpad for further attacks.
    - After gaining unauthorized access, attackers can freely upload and download files, view and alter communication settings.
    - Modified settings can cause the unit to stop communicating after a reboot or perform unintended communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the FTP service of the EtherNet/IP unit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected unit. They would need some level of access to the network where the device is connected. The attacker needs to have the ability to send FTP requests to the affected device.
