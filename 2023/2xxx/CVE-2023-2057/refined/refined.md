- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `litpic_local` parameter when editing an article type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which will be executed in the context of a user's browser when the user edits the vulnerable content again. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user crafts a POST request to the `login.php` endpoint, specifically when editing article types (Arctype), with a malicious payload in the `litpic_local` parameter. The attacker needs to be authenticated to the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with administrative privileges in the target eyoucms instance. They must be able to access the admin panel, navigate to the "Arctype" editing section, and be able to send HTTP POST requests.
