Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization check in the `get` function of the Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress. The function is intended to retrieve plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `get` function lacks a proper capability check, which would normally restrict access to users with specific roles or permissions.
- **Bypassable Nonce Check:** While a nonce check exists, it's only executed if a nonce is provided. If no nonce is included in the request, the check is skipped entirely, effectively bypassing the protection it intended to offer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Subscriber-level attackers (users with minimal privileges) can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve plugin settings. Although the impact is rated as low confidentiality, the disclosure of plugin settings could potentially aid in further attacks by exposing configuration details.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected WordPress site.
- **Direct Request:** The attack vector involves directly calling the `get` function via an AJAX request, without providing a nonce.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low-Privilege Access:** An attacker only needs subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- **Understanding of Plugin's AJAX Call:** The attacker needs to know the correct AJAX action to trigger the vulnerable `get` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `Admin.php` file of the Essential Blocks plugin, specifically within the `get` function.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.7 of the plugin by adding the necessary capability check.

This information provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, including the specific function vulnerable, how the nonce check is bypassed, and the low-privilege level needed for exploitation.
