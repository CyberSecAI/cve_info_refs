Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2494

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `process_postdata` function within the Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary capabilities to perform certain actions, allowing users with limited privileges to modify plugin access settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing users to execute the `process_postdata` function.
- **Limited Privilege Granting:** The vulnerability allows users who should only have limited access to modify plugin access permissions that are normally restricted to administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with a role that the administrator has granted access to the plugin can modify access settings, potentially granting themselves or others elevated privileges within the plugin. This means a user with limited rights can change who has access to the plugin and what level of access they have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network (AV:N).
- **Complexity:** The attack complexity is high (AC:H), likely because the attacker needs to be authenticated and have specific access granted by the administrator to begin with.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (PR:L).
- The attacker must have a role that the administrator has previously granted some level of access to the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 3.3.19.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 4.6.
