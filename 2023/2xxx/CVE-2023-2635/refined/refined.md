- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the plugin's settings, such as the "Button Text" field, are vulnerable to XSS injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the affected page.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts into vulnerable settings of the plugin through the administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-level administrative privileges within the WordPress instance. The attacker also needs to access the pluginâ€™s settings page and inject the malicious code.
