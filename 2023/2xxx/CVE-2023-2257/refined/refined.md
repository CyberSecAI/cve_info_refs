Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an unimplemented "Force Login" security feature in the Devolutions Workspace Desktop application when integrated with Hub Business.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass. When the "Force Login" feature is enabled on the Hub Business instance, the Workspace Desktop application fails to enforce it.
- **Unimplemented Feature:** The "Force Login" feature, while present in settings, was not properly implemented in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with local access to the user interface can unlock a Hub Business space without needing to enter the required password.
- This leads to unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data or resources within the Hub Business space.
- The integrity of the system is potentially lowered due to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to a machine where the vulnerable Workspace Desktop application is running.
- **User Interface Interaction:** The attacker must interact with the application's user interface to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have physical or remote access to a computer with the vulnerable version of the Workspace Desktop application installed.
- No specific user credentials are required for the bypass after initial access to the user interface.
- The attacker needs to have the Hub Business "Force Login" setting enabled for the exploit to be viable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and macOS versions of the Workspace Desktop application.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 6.1.
- The fix is available in version 2023.1.1.4 and higher.
