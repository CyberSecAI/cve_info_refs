Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the server's handling of compressed messages. Specifically, the server uses a recursive function to decompress and parse packets. A specially crafted compressed message (a "quine") that decompresses to itself will cause infinite recursion, eventually leading to a crash due to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability exists because there is no check to prevent recursion when processing compressed packets, and the length is not validated after decompression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Recursive Processing:** The core weakness is the recursive nature of the `decompress_and_parse_packet` function. The function calls itself after decompressing data, creating a loop if the decompressed data triggers the same compression handling logic again.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The server does not perform any validation on the decompressed message length, which allows a crafted message with a deceptive length field to trigger the recursive call.
- **No Recursion Limit:** The server doesn't implement a limit on the depth of recursion, thus allowing the stack to be exhausted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The recursive calls will consume all available stack memory, causing the server process to crash. This makes the service unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network, targeting the administration port (default TCP 1100) of the Globalscape EFT server.
- **Malicious Compressed Packet:** The attacker sends a specially crafted, recursively compressed packet to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target server's administration port.
- **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker needs to know how to send valid messages to the Globalscape EFT admin port including compressed messages.
- **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must generate a compression quine (a compressed message that decompresses to itself).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in EFT versions 8.0.0.38 and 8.0.x and is fixed in version 8.1.0.16.
- The vulnerability can be exploited if:
    - The EFT server is administered remotely.
    - Remote administration is allowed from the Internet.
    - The default port 1100 is used.
    - Trusted IPs are not whitelisted.
- The vendor recommends limiting access to administer EFT at the network level and not exposing port 1100 to the internet.
- The most secure method is to disallow remote administration outside of the host EFT server and only login via localhost.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available on GitHub in the Gestalt project
