- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-controlled parameters before outputting them back into HTML attributes. Specifically, the `page` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can be executed when a user, especially one with high privileges such as an administrator, opens the crafted link. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the targeted user, such as stealing session cookies, changing configurations, or performing other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in user, especially an administrator, into opening this URL. The attacker does not require any authentication to trigger the vulnerability itself; the authentication is required by the targeted user.
