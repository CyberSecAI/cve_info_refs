Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of missing nonce verification and insufficient input sanitization within the `get_users` function of the Active Directory Integration plugin. Specifically, the `orderby` and `order` parameters, which are user-supplied via the `$_GET` array, are not properly secured before being incorporated into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The `get_users` function lacks nonce verification, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The `orderby` and `order` parameters are sanitized using `sanitize_text_field` but are not properly prepared for use in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This is because the sanitized input is used with string formatting rather than prepared statements.
    - The code uses `%1s` as a placeholder in the `prepare` method, which does not prevent SQL injection when used for ordering clauses.
3. **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization/Escaping**: Although `sanitize_text_field` is used, it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection when constructing SQL queries, especially ordering clauses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a time-based SQL injection attack leading to resource exhaustion by injecting malicious SQL queries, which may lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **CSRF Attack:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by an administrator, executes arbitrary SQL queries.
2. **SQL Injection:** The forged request injects malicious SQL code via the `orderby` and `order` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the affected WordPress site.
2. **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into triggering the malicious request, usually by clicking on a crafted link.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class-mo-ldap-user-auth-reports.php` file. Specifically within the `get_users` function.
*   The vulnerability exists because the `orderby` and `order` parameters are directly incorporated into the SQL query using string formatting instead of using proper prepared statements.
*   The fix involves implementing proper nonce verification and using secure SQL query preparation techniques.
*   The vulnerable plugin is the "Active Directory Integration / LDAP Integration" plugin for WordPress, versions 4.1.4 and below.
*   The patched version is 4.1.5.
