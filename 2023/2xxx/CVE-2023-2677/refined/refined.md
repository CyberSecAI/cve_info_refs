The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `/cts_qr/admin/establishment/manage.php` endpoint.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is a **SQL injection** vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially:
    - Access sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Possibly gain control of the server depending on the database user's permissions.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the HTTP GET parameter `id` within the URL `/cts_qr/admin/establishment/manage.php?id=...`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `id` parameter. They don't require prior authentication for this specific vulnerability.

The provided example payload `id=-3 union all select null,null,concat(0x66676869,0x3536373839),null,null,null,null-- -` demonstrates a successful SQL injection attempt by using a `UNION SELECT` statement, which retrieves the injected hex string within the database response.
