Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `OBJ_obj2txt()` function in OpenSSL. This function translates OBJECT IDENTIFIERs (OIDs) from their binary ASN.1 representation to a human-readable numeric string format. The function did not impose limits on the size of the sub-identifiers within the OID. When processing OIDs with extremely large sub-identifiers, the translation process can become computationally intensive, with a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the size of the sub-identifier in bytes, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of input validation:** The `OBJ_obj2txt()` function lacked proper input validation, specifically the size of the OID sub-identifiers.
- **Algorithmic complexity:** The function's translation algorithm for numeric text form had quadratic time complexity with respect to the input size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted OID with oversized sub-identifiers, an attacker can cause a vulnerable application to spend excessive time in `OBJ_obj2txt()`, potentially leading to a DoS.
- **Resource exhaustion:** The quadratic time complexity leads to disproportionately high resource consumption, impacting system performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** This vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending specially crafted ASN.1 data containing malformed OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.
- **Data source:** The OIDs are typically received via network protocols like OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF, TS, or within X.509 certificates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted data to an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL library.
- **Control over OID data:** The attacker needs control over the data used for OBJ\_obj2txt(), often within X.509 certificates or other ASN.1 encoded structures.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as "Moderate" severity in the OpenSSL advisory, but NetApp lists the score as 6.5 (MEDIUM).
- The fix involves imposing a size limit (586 bytes) on OIDs that `OBJ_obj2txt()` will process in the numeric text form.
- The vulnerability exists in various versions of OpenSSL (1.0.2, 1.1.1, 3.0.x, and 3.1.x), but specific scenarios might be needed for exploitation depending on OpenSSL version and application logic.
- Some NetApp products are vulnerable due to their inclusion of affected versions of OpenSSL.
- OpenSSL versions 3.0 and later can be more affected as the use of OBJ\_obj2txt() is more prevalent than in older versions.
- While TLS is mentioned in the context of client-certificate authentication, the impact on TLS is considered relatively low due to limits in certificate chain size.
- In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 the impact is mostly confined to displaying of diverse objects.
- The fix is implemented by restricting the translation to 586 bytes or less, based on RFC 2578.
- The vulnerability was initially detected by OSS-Fuzz in January 2020, but re-evaluated and identified as a security issue in April 2023.
- NetApp identified that some of their products are affected by the vulnerability.
- Debian issued a security advisory, DSA 5417-1, addressing the vulnerability in OpenSSL.
- The issue was fixed in OpenSSL versions 3.0.9, 3.1.1, 1.1.1u, and 1.0.2zh.

In summary, CVE-2023-2650 is a vulnerability in the `OBJ_obj2txt()` function within OpenSSL that, when processing oversized OBJECT IDENTIFIERs, can lead to a denial-of-service attack. This is due to the O(n^2) time complexity in translation. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through malformed ASN.1 data and affects multiple versions of OpenSSL.
