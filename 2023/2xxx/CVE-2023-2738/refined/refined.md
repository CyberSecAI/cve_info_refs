```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `activeTab` parameter in the `actionGetdata()` method of `GatewayController.php` is controllable. This control, combined with how the `GetData()` method handles the `id` and `$attribute` parameters, allows for arbitrary file writing through array closure using `fwrite()`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted control of the `activeTab` parameter.",
    "Unvalidated usage of the `$attribute` parameter in file writing.",
    "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability via `fwrite()`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files, to the server's file system. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing a webshell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `/general/appbuilder/web/portal/gateway/getdata` with the malicious payload in the `activeTab` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and know the path to the webroot to upload malicious files. No authentication is explicitly mentioned."
