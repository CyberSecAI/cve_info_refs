The provided content relates to a stack overflow vulnerability in the `cflow` utility.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Recursive calls between `func_body` and `parse_variable_declaration` functions in `parser.c` lead to excessive stack usage, resulting in a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to stack exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input file (`poc-file`) with the `cflow` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to be processed by the vulnerable `cflow` utility.
