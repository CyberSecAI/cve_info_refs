The content is related to CVE-2023-2586.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Teltonika Remote Management System (RMS) versions 4.14.0 allows unauthorized registration of previously unregistered devices. Specifically, if the "RMS management feature" is enabled (which is the default), an attacker can register a device to their own account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper authentication (CWE-287)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation enables an attacker to perform operations on the user's devices, including remote code execution with 'root' privileges, via the 'Task Manager' feature on RMS. The attacker can take control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote network access. The attacker can register a device through the RMS platform.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the RMS platform and needs to know (or be able to determine) the serial number and MAC address of an unregistered device. The attacker does not require any privileges on the system.
