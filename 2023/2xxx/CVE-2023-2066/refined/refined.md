Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2066

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks within several AJAX functions of the "Announcement & Notification Banner â€“ Bulletin" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the functions `bulletinwp_update_bulletin_status`, `bulletinwp_update_bulletin`, `bulletinwp_update_settings`, `bulletinwp_update_status`, `bulletinwp_export_bulletins`, and `bulletinwp_import_bulletins` lack proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of checks to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to execute these AJAX actions. This means that any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level access, can trigger these functions.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The lack of authorization allows any user with low privilege to update bulletin status, update bulletin content, modify settings, and export/import bulletins by manipulating the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can modify the plugin's settings, alter existing bulletins, create new bulletins, and export or import bulletin data. This can lead to:
   - Defacement of the website through manipulated bulletin content.
   - Injection of malicious scripts via manipulated content.
   - Unauthorised modification of the intended message displayed by the bulletin.
   - Potential disruption of website functionality through modified settings.
   - Data exfiltration through the export feature.
   - Data manipulation via import feature

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the WordPress AJAX interface, using the vulnerable plugin's AJAX actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users. Even users with subscriber-level access can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable actions:** Attacker would require to understand how to interact with AJAX interface and which actions are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 3.6.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7.0 by implementing the `check_page_access_permission()` function.
- The provided code snippets demonstrate that the `check_ajax_referer` is present, however it does not protect from this issue since an authenticated user would still be able to send valid nonces and perform the actions without proper authorization.
