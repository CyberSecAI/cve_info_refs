Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2448

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `userpro_shortcode_template` function of the UserPro WordPress plugin. This lack of proper authorization allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check on the `userpro_shortcode_template` function, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shortcodes, which can lead to various impacts depending on the shortcodes used.
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access functionality and data they shouldn't have access to.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** By leveraging another vulnerability CVE-2023-2446 along with the shortcode execution an attacker can potentially gain sensitive information through shortcodes
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Arbitrary shortcode execution can be used as a stepping stone to further compromise the site, depending on the shortcodes available.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote, unauthenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** An attacker does not need any prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in UserPro plugin versions up to and including 5.1.4
- It was discovered by István Márton from Wordfence
- The vulnerability was patched in version 5.1.5, therefore updating is advised.
