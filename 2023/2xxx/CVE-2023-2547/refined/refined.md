Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2547

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `deleteUser` function within the Feather Login Page plugin lacks proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `deleteUser` function, intended to remove temporary users created by the plugin, can be accessed by any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions or higher. This is because there isn't a capability check to ensure that only users with the necessary permissions (like 'manage_options') can access it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with minimal access (subscriber or higher) can delete temporary users created by the plugin which can cause loss of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a request to the `wp_ajax_ftlpp-ext-expirable-delete-user` action, triggering the vulnerable `deleteUser` function.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the vulnerable AJAX action.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the Feather Login Page plugin from 1.0.7 to 1.1.1 inclusive.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.2.
- The provided code snippet contains the vulnerable `deleteUser` function and the AJAX hook.
- The provided code snippet reveals additional features of the plugin, such as creating temporary users with a specific role, and providing them with an expiring login link.
