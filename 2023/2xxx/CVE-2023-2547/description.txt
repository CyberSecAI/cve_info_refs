The Feather Login Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'deleteUser' function in versions starting from 1.0.7 up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete the temp user generated by the plugin.
