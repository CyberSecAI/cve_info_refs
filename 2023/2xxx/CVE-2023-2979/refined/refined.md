Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of access control when creating new shared users. Specifically, a parameter called "**profile**" is sent in the HTTPS request when creating a shared user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The system does not properly validate or enforce the user's permissions when creating a new user. A standard user can manipulate the "**profile**" parameter.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The "profile" parameter can be modified from "shared" to "standard" by a standard user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A standard user can create a new "standard" user instead of a "shared" user. This allows the user to bypass intended restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the "profile" parameter within the HTTP request when creating a new user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a logged-in standard user of Pydio Cells 4.2.0.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by DeepCove Cybersecurity (DCC).
*   A patch was released in Pydio Cells 4.2.1 to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability was reported on May 11, 2023, and patched on May 22, 2023.

This detailed description is consistent with the CVE ID, which refers to a broken access control vulnerability.
