      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file read.",

     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific URL containing the malicious path traversal sequence.  The provided example uses a project path with nested subgroups. No specific authorization is mentioned, so it could be assumed this could be achieved by any authenticated user."
