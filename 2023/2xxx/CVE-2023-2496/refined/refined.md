Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2496

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper capability check within the `validate_upload` function of the Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user capabilities before allowing file uploads. This allows users with granted access to the plugin to upload arbitrary files, even if they lack the necessary administrative privileges to do so.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files to the affected server.
- **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** By uploading specific types of files (e.g., PHP scripts), an attacker might achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the website.
- **Complete Website Compromise:** The impact of successful remote code execution could range from data theft, defacement, or complete takeover of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a user account with access to the plugin, granted by the admin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site with a role that has been granted access to the Go Pricing plugin's features.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable function (`validate_upload`) to exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 3.3.19.
- Version 3.4 of the plugin includes a fix for this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.1, classified as High severity.
- The vulnerability allows arbitrary file uploads and potentially remote code execution.
- The exploit is initiated through the pluginâ€™s upload functionality, by bypassing the insufficient access control checks on the `validate_upload` function.
