The Elementor Addons, Widgets and Enhancements â€“ Stax plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the toggle_widget function in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to enable or disable Elementor widgets.
