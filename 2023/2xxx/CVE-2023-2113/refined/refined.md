- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape settings imported from a previous export.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin panel, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious JSON file containing JavaScript code and importing it through the plugin's settings import feature, an attacker can trigger the XSS payload. The attacker needs to compress the JSON file into a zip file before importing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrator-level privileges or equivalent access to import plugin settings.
