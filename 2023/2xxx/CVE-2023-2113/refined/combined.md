## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Autoptimize < 3.1.7 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Settings Import

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the settings imported from a previous export, allowing high privileged users (such as an administrator) to inject arbitrary javascript into the admin panel, even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disabled, such as in a multisite setup.

### Proof of Concept

To reproduce this vulnerability be sure to follow the steps below:
1. Generate a JSON file with the following content:
{"ccss":{"rules":"{\"paths\":{\"foo\":{\"hash\":0,\"file\":\"<script>alert(`Stoooored XSS`)</script>\"}}}"}}
Make sure to save this file with the name: "settings.json" (required).
2. Compress this "settings.json" file into a zip file with any name. The application backend only expects to receive this type of extension (zip).
3. In the web application (in the "Critical CSS" section) once you have selected your zip file to upload, click on the "Import Settings" button.
The payload should be triggered immediately upon upload.
