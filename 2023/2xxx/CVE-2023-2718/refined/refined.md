Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Contact Form Email" WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-submitted data before displaying it in HTML. Specifically, the message field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin stores user-submitted data (specifically the message field), which is later rendered without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user views the stored message in the backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the message field of the contact form.
- When a site administrator views the message in the backend, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser.
- The impact of the XSS can vary, but it could lead to actions such as:
    - Stealing administrator session cookies, leading to account compromise.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the administrator, such as modifying site content or settings.
    - Redirecting the administrator to a malicious site.
    - Other malicious actions as defined by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via the contact form's message field.
- An attacker can submit a crafted message containing malicious JavaScript code through the publicly accessible contact form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication. They can be an anonymous user who can access the contact form on the website.
- The attacker needs the ability to fill the message field of the contact form, and insert malicious code.
- No specific technical skills are required beyond crafting a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not escape the data submitted in the message field before displaying it within a `<textarea>` tag.
- An attacker can use a payload like `</textarea><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>` in the message field. The `</textarea>` tag closes the existing textarea tag, allowing the `<img>` tag with the malicious JavaScript to be rendered in the HTML.
- The malicious code gets triggered when the administrator edits the message from the backend.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.38 of the "Contact Form Email" plugin.
- This is an unauthenticated stored XSS vulnerability.

The information in the provided content gives a clear picture of the vulnerability, which aligns with the described behavior of stored XSS, and its associated impact.
