- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating the Access Code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability allowing unauthorized changes to the plugin's access code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the plugin's access code to an attacker-controlled value, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious link or web page that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers the access code update action. This is achieved using a GET request to `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gf_googlesheet&code=attacker-code`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious URL or web page controlled by the attacker. The admin must have the appropriate permissions to modify the plugin settings.
