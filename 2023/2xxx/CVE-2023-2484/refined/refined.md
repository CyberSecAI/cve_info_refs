{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied 'orderby' and 'order' parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with administrator privileges can append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or higher.",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 4.1.4 of the Active Directory Integration plugin. The 'orderby' and 'order' parameters, when supplied by the user, are not properly sanitized before being included in a database query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through these parameters and manipulate database operations, potentially leading to data exfiltration. The vulnerability is a time-based SQL Injection, which means that attackers can use the timing of the database responses to gain information."
