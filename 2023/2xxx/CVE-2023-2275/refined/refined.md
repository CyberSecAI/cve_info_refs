### Summary of CVE-2023-2275

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace – REST API plugin for WordPress, in versions up to 1.5.3, lacks proper authorization checks within its REST API endpoints. Specifically, the functions `get_item`, `get_order_notes`, and `add_order_note` do not verify if the authenticated user has the necessary capabilities to access order details, view order notes, and add new order notes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin fails to implement capability checks on the REST API functions responsible for retrieving and modifying order data and notes. This allows unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be permitted to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Order/Order Note Disclosure:** An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber role or higher) can gain access to sensitive order details and associated notes of other users.
- **Order Note Addition:** An attacker can inject arbitrary order notes, potentially causing confusion or disruption.
- Although the CVSS score is only 4.3 (Medium) because the impact is only a low integrity and no confidentiality impact, the ability for any authenticated user to see other people's order details is significant in a multi-vendor environment, not to mention the risk of adding fake notes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** Attackers exploit the plugin's REST API endpoints, specifically the vulnerable `get_item`, `get_order_notes` and `add_order_note` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by István Márton from Wordfence.
- The issue has been addressed in version 1.6.0 of the plugin.
- The plugin's permission checks erroneously used `apply_filters` to determine access rather than using capability checks. This has been corrected in the new version.
