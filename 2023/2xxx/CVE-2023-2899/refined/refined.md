- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with Contributor+ role can inject malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes. This script executes when a page containing the shortcode is viewed by a user, potentially targeting high-privilege users like administrators, leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with JavaScript in the attributes such as `height`  using the  `onmouseover` event. For example: `[google-map-sc height='100px" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a WordPress account with Contributor or higher privileges to create posts or pages with shortcodes, as well as inject malicious shortcode attributes. The database needs to be utf8_general_ci compatible.
