## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Leyka < 3.30.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

Note: The issue was reported to the vendor on May 30th, 2023 and unfortunately hot fixed in 3.30.3 rather than releasing a new version.

### Proof of Concept

In the "My Data" section of the plugin settings, enter the payload `<svg/onload=alert('xss1')>` for either the "text of personal data usage Terms" or "text of Terms of donation service" settings . Set at least one payment method, load the campaign, and view the XSS.
