The provided content is related to CVE-2023-2995.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Leyka WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high-privilege user (such as an administrator) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which is then executed when other users view the affected pages. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker, with administrative privileges, can inject the malicious payload in the pluginâ€™s settings page, specifically within the "My Data" section, using the "text of personal data usage Terms" or "text of Terms of donation service" fields. The XSS is triggered when a campaign is loaded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or higher within the WordPress site. The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the plugin settings.
