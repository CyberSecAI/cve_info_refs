- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The KiviCare Management System plugin does not implement proper CSRF checks for various AJAX actions. This allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users without their consent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing or flawed CSRF protection in multiple AJAX actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can delete arbitrary appointments, medical records, and other data.
    - Attackers can create and update users (patients, doctors, etc.) including modifying user details like name, mobile number, and gender.
    - In the specific case of updating doctor profiles, attackers can reset fields like specialisation.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker crafts a malicious URL or HTML form and tricks a logged-in administrator into opening it.
    - The crafted requests exploit the lack of CSRF protection to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious link or page under the attacker's control.
    - The attacker does not require any authenticated access to the WordPress system, they rely on the victim's active authenticated session.
