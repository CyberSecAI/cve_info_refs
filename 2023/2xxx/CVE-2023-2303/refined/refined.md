Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-2303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce validation in the `vcita-callback.php` file of the "Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita" WordPress plugin. This allows the plugin settings to be modified via a forged request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of nonce validation makes the plugin vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin takes user-controlled input via `$_GET` parameters and stores them in the database without proper sanitization, leading to stored XSS. Specifically, the `email` and `uid` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings by tricking a site administrator into clicking on a crafted link. This can lead to:
    - **Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can execute arbitrary code within the administrator's browser session when they access the plugin's settings page.
    - **Persistent XSS:** The injected code is stored in the database, leading to persistent XSS. The injected code from `email` parameter is triggered in admin settings pages, while the injected code from `uid` is triggered for any visitor when browsing infected site.
    - **Website takeover**: By injecting malicious JavaScript in the admin section, it is possible for an attacker to escalate privileges, create new accounts, modify website content, or otherwise gain complete control of the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL or form that, when clicked by a logged-in administrator, sends a request to the vulnerable `vcita-callback.php` file.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action like clicking a link to trigger the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account or any privileges on the target WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form.
- **Understanding of target plugin endpoints**: The attacker needs to understand the plugin's vulnerable endpoint URL structure and parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `vcita-callback.php` where `$_GET` parameters such as `uid`, `email`, `first_name`, etc. are retrieved, sanitized with `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` and stored in the database using `vcita_parse_expert_data`.
- The `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` with the `FILTER_FLAG_ENCODE_HIGH` flag is insufficient to prevent XSS, especially when dealing with HTML/JavaScript injection.
- There is a lack of nonce validation within this file, meaning it will process the request from any attacker.

**Affected versions:**
- Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita plugin versions up to and including 2.6.4

**Remediation:**
- No known patch is available at the time of the information provided. It is recommended to review the vulnerability details and consider uninstalling the software and finding an alternative or mitigating the vulnerability based on the organization's risk tolerance.

This information provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability than the initial CVE description, especially regarding the specific vulnerable code and how it is exploited for CSRF leading to Stored XSS.
