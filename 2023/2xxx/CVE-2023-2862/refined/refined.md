Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `api/stl/actions/search` interface. Specifically, user-supplied input is not being validated or encoded before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the `api/stl/actions/search` interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by a user. This can lead to:
   - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Defacing the website
    - Executing arbitrary actions on the user's behalf within the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through a network request to the `api/stl/actions/search` interface, which is publicly accessible.
- **Payload:** The attacker would craft a URL with a malicious script embedded within the parameters of the vulnerable endpoint, and then trick a user into clicking or visiting it

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and be able to convince a user to visit the crafted link. The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the code. The attacker can be in any network location, as long as they can send network requests to the application and convince a user to click the malicious link.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its request parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text includes a temporary solution: The code snippet in the issue report suggests that a regular expression is used to detect potentially malicious script tags in the user input.
- The fix was implemented in version 7.2.1
- The vulnerability was discovered using Acunetix WVS vulnerability scanner.
- The vulnerability is present in the `SSCMS.Web.Controllers.Stl.ActionsSearchController.Submit.cs` file
