Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of nonce validation in several AJAX functions within the Announcement & Notification Banner â€“ Bulletin WordPress plugin. Specifically, the functions `bulletinwp_update_bulletin_status`, `bulletinwp_update_bulletin`, `bulletinwp_update_settings`, `bulletinwp_update_status`, `bulletinwp_export_bulletins`, and `bulletinwp_import_bulletins` did not include proper checks to verify the authenticity of the requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF due to the missing nonce validation. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this CSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Modify the plugin's settings
- Modify existing bulletins.
- Create new bulletins.
- Export bulletins
- Import bulletins

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack requires a user to be tricked into clicking a malicious link or performing some action that triggers a crafted request (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and entice a logged-in administrator to unknowingly trigger that request by clicking on a link or similar action.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerable functions are all admin-ajax actions.
- The fix implemented in version 3.7.1 adds a `check_ajax_referer` call to each of the vulnerable functions.
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 3.7.0.
