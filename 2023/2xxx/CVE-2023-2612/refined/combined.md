# USN-6124-1: Linux kernel (OEM) vulnerabilities

30 May 2023

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-oem-5.17](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-5.17) - Linux kernel for OEM systems

## Details

Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in

the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests,

leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2023-32233](/security/CVE-2023-32233))

Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86

processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers

in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a

denial of service (guest crash). ([CVE-2023-30456](/security/CVE-2023-30456))

Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-3586](/security/CVE-2022-3586))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel

did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2022-4139](/security/CVE-2022-4139))

It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1670](/security/CVE-2023-1670))

Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu

Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2023-2612](/security/CVE-2023-2612))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-oem-22.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-5.17)
  -
  [5.17.0.1032.30](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-5.17/5.17.0.1032.30)
* [linux-image-oem-22.04a](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-5.17)
  -
  [5.17.0.1032.30](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-5.17/5.17.0.1032.30)
* [linux-image-5.17.0-1032-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-5.17)
  -
  [5.17.0-1032.33](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-5.17/5.17.0-1032.33)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-6123-1: Linux kernel (OEM) vulnerabilities

30 May 2023

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-oem-6.0](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-6.0) - Linux kernel for OEM systems

## Details

Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in

the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests,

leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2023-32233](/security/CVE-2023-32233))

Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86

processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers

in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a

denial of service (guest crash). ([CVE-2023-30456](/security/CVE-2023-30456))

It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2023-1670](/security/CVE-2023-1670))

Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu

Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2023-2612](/security/CVE-2023-2612))

It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle a loop termination condition, leading to an

out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2023-26606](/security/CVE-2023-26606))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-oem-22.04b](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.0)
  -
  [6.0.0.1017.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-6.0/6.0.0.1017.17)
* [linux-image-6.0.0-1017-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.0)
  -
  [6.0.0-1017.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-6.0/6.0.0-1017.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# CVE-2023-2612

| **Name** | CVE-2023-2612 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2612) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2612); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2023-2612), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2023-2612), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2023-2612), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2023-2612), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-2612), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2612), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-2612), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-2612)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2612/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2023-2612)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2023-2612%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2023-2612%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2023-2612%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

## Notes

```
NOT-FOR-US: shiftfs (part of Ubuntu kernels, not not upstream)

UBUNTU: SAUCE: shiftfs: prevent lock unbalance in shiftfs\_create\_object()Make sure to always acquire the inode lock of loweri\_dir\_iop when
accessing its methods.
This also prevents an lock unbalance when one of such methods is not
implemented.
