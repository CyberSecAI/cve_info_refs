- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pretty Url WordPress plugin does not sanitize and escape the URL field in the plugin settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. These scripts will execute when the settings page is reloaded, allowing the attacker to perform actions within the context of the administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin settings page. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject the malicious script in the URL field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in order to access and modify the plugin settings.
