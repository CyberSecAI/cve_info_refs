- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the BadgeOS plugin's shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the infected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerable shortcodes within the BadgeOS plugin by injecting malicious scripts as attribute values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site.
