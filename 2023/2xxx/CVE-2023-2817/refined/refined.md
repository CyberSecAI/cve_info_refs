Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2817

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of field names in Craft CMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML, including `<script>` tags, into the field name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected HTML is stored within the Craft CMS database and executed whenever a user accesses the "Categories" or "Entries" pages where the crafted field is used.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Craft CMS fails to properly sanitize user input when creating field names, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user
    - Defacing the website
    - Potentially gaining full access to the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious HTML into a field name via the Craft CMS control panel.
- This crafted field is then added to a category or section.
- The XSS payload is executed when a user views the "Categories" or "Entries" page where this field is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary permissions to create and modify fields and categories/sections within Craft CMS.
- This is a post-authentication vulnerability, meaning an attacker would need legitimate access to the application in order to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `7655e1009ba6cdbfb230e6bb138b775b69fc7bcb` addresses the vulnerability by encoding HTML entities in the labels displayed in the Craft control panel. This sanitization prevents the malicious code from being executed in the user's browser. The fix specifically uses `Craft.escapeHtml()` on the labels within the `BaseElementIndex.js` and `CustomizeSourcesModal.js` files.
- The vulnerability is present in Craft CMS versions <= 4.4.11.
- The Tenable advisory provides a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) explaining how to trigger this vulnerability.
