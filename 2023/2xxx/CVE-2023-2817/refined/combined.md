# Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Craft CMS

Low

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A researcher at Tenable discovered a post-authentication stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Craft CMS core.

When creating a new field it is possible to inject html, including script tags, and inject an XSS payload which will be executed by users accessing the “Categories” and “Entries” pages.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. Create a new field with a name such as <script>alert(document.domain)</script>

2. Create a new category or section and add the field created in step 1.

3. The payload will be executed when accessing the Categories or Entries pages, respectively.

### Solution

Craft CMS has fixed this issue in github commit <https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/7655e1009ba6cdbfb230e6bb138b775b69fc7bcb> which will be included in the next release.
