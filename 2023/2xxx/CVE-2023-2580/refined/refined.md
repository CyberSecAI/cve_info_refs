- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AI-Engine plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in specific settings fields, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database, allowing execution of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with high-privileges (like admin), can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the site. This can lead to user account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious JavaScript into specific setting fields within the AI-Engine plugin, namely "Start Sentence" or "Compliance Text" fields under the Chatbot Visual Settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-privileges access to the WordPress admin panel to access and modify the vulnerable plugin settings. This is typically an Admin or similar user role. The vulnerability can be exploited even if the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
