Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the External Visitor Manager portal of HID SAFE. Specifically, the application programmable interface (API) is susceptible to manipulation within web fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (CWE-471):** The application incorrectly assumes that certain data, such as the visitor-id, is immutable. This allows an attacker to modify this data through the web API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Personal Data:** By manipulating the visitor-id, an attacker can gain access to the personal data of other users.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker can send an unlimited number of requests to the HID SAFE Web Server, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Web API Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by manipulating web fields within the API of the External Visitor Manager portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Login Credentials:** The attacker needs valid login credentials to access the system and to make a request. These credentials can be obtained through an internal user.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the web API to manipulate fields and access other users data.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in HID SAFE versions 5.8.0 through 5.11.3 when using the optional External Visitor Manager portal.
*   The issue was discovered through CISA internal research and reported to HID.
*   The affected systems have been patched according to HID Global.
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
