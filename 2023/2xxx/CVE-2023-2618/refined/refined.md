  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `DecodedBitStreamParser::decodeHanziSegment` function of the wechat_qrcode module in OpenCV. The code allocates memory using `new` but does not always release it via `delete` in error conditions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory leak due to improper handling of memory allocation in error conditions"
      ],
      "impact": "The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. The attack can be launched remotely.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via crafted input that triggers the vulnerable code path."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable `DecodedBitStreamParser::decodeHanziSegment` function, typically through a QR code that contains specific data patterns."
