The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins. One of these vulnerabilities, **SECURITY-3118** is associated with **CVE-2023-2631**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-2631:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2631

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check

**Affected Plugin:** Code Dx Plugin

**Affected Versions:** Code Dx Plugin 3.1.0 and earlier

**Root Cause:** The Code Dx Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing permission checks on multiple HTTP endpoints.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of POST request requirements on the same HTTP endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL.
- Attackers can perform actions that should require higher privileges due to the missing permission checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network based attacks.
- Attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to an endpoint of the Code Dx plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
- User interaction is not required for the missing permission check vulnerability, but it is for the CSRF.

**Fix:** Code Dx Plugin should be updated to version 4.0.0. This version requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
