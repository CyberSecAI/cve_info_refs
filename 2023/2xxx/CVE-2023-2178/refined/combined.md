## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Aajoda Testimonials < 2.2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In Aajoda » Optional Aajoda Style, insert the following payload: "></textarea><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
2. Save the changes to get the XSS exploit.
