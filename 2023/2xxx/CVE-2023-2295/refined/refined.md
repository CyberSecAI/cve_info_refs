    "description": "The libreswan flaw [CVE-2023-30570](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-30570) was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via erratum RHSA-2023:2122 and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via erratum RHSA-2023:2120, released on May 04, 2023. However, the fix for this issue was not included in the libreswan updates released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 GA erratum (RHBA-2023:2865) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 GA erratum (RHBA-2023:2355), causing a security regression of previously released fix. A new CVE-ID [CVE-2023-2295](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2295) was assigned for this security regression.  Note that this issue and CVE-ID is specific to the libreswan packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is not applicable to any upstream libreswan version or libreswan packages of any other vendor that are not directly based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages.",
    "root_cause": "The fix for CVE-2023-30570 was unintentionally omitted in the libreswan updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 and 9.2, causing a regression.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Security regression due to a missing fix"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the pluto daemon state machine. No remote code execution is possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending an IKEv1 Aggressive Mode packet with only unacceptable crypto algorithms",
        "Subsequent packet where the sender reuses the libreswan responder SPI as its own initiator SPI"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send a crafted IKEv1 Aggressive Mode packet with only unacceptable crypto algorithms to trigger the vulnerability. They also need to send a subsequent packet reusing the libreswan responder SPI as its initiator SPI.",

      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8",
