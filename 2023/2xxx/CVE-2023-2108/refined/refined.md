**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being directly used in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Data Exposure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the provided payload that retrieves the database name.
*   Potential for full database compromise: With further exploitation, the attacker can potentially manipulate or delete data, or gain full access to the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `edit_contestant.php` endpoint.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `contestant_id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required for this specific vulnerability.
