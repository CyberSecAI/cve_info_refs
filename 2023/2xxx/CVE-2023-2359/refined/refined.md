The provided content relates to CVE-2023-2359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Revolution Slider plugin does not validate the type of files during import, leading to arbitrary file upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Arbitrary File Upload: The plugin allows uploading files without proper validation of their type, allowing malicious actors to upload arbitrary files, including executable code.
-   Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a PHP file and if the server is configured to execute PHP files from the upload directory, an attacker can achieve RCE by accessing the uploaded file directly through the web server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading and accessing a malicious file. This can lead to complete control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious zip file that replaces an image file with a PHP file and then uploading this malicious zip through the "Manual Import" functionality of the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   An attacker needs to have at least Author level access to the WordPress dashboard (or Editor, if configured by admin).
-   The server needs to be configured to execute PHP files from the `/wp-content/uploads` directory.
