Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the date fields within the "Conditions" tab of Pricing Rules in the Pimcore e-commerce framework. Specifically, the `DateRange` condition allows users to input date values, and these values were not being properly checked for HTML characters before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the date fields, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser when the pricing rules are displayed or processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal session cookies or tokens, leading to account compromise.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive data could be stolen by intercepting requests or modifying the page.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the page, affecting the user interface.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker could inject elements that appear legitimate to trick users into giving up their credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript into the date input fields (starting and ending dates) within the "Conditions" tab of Pricing Rules.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerable application displays or processes the pricing rules, executing the malicious code embedded in the date fields in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Pimcore Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the Pimcore admin panel where pricing rules can be configured.
- **Ability to Create/Modify Pricing Rules:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify pricing rules with date conditions.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the date fields are not properly sanitized and that they can inject malicious code.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided code diffs show that the fix includes checks within the `onChange` handler of the date input fields to prevent injection of HTML characters. If HTML characters are detected in the date input, the input value will be set to `null`.
- The commit message and pull request title explicitly mention "Fix XSS in Conditions tab of Pricing Rules".
