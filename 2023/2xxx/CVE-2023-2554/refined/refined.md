Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause across multiple files is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, particularly within SQL queries and file path constructions. This allows for potential SQL injection and path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Several instances of direct embedding of user-controlled data into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization. This occurs in `core/ajax/ajax_data.php` where GET parameters are directly inserted into SQL queries using string concatenation.
*   **Path Traversal:**  Several instances where user-controlled input is used to construct file paths without proper sanitization. This occurs in `core/functions.php`, `core/route.php`, `include/apps/xhr/index.php`, and `include/apps/xhr/info.php` where `$_GET` parameters are used in file paths. The fix in these files involves removing path traversal characters (`./` and `../`) from the input.
*   **Improper HTML escaping:** Some instances where data from the database is inserted directly into the HTML output without proper escaping, in `assets/js/bms.js` and `assets/js/events.js`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Data breach: unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
    *   Data manipulation: modification or deletion of data.
    *   Privilege escalation: gaining administrative access or executing arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Path Traversal:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Arbitrary file access: read or write access to files outside the intended directory.
    *   Remote code execution: if an attacker can write to an executable file.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of HTML escaping could allow for XSS attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts to execute in the browsers of users of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious payloads via the GET parameters used in the application. The vulnerable GET parameters can be `$_GET["s"]`, `$_GET["catId"]`, `$_GET["brand"]`, `$_GET["edition"]`, `$_GET["generic"]`, `$_GET["author"]`, `$_GET["terms"]`, `$_GET["sort"]`, `$_GET["wid"]`.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into the `$_GET['module']` parameter, when requesting files in `/include/apps/xhr/` or when calling `easyUpload` function or accessing a page using the routing system.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or javascript into the database that gets rendered in the select2 components or in `iledit` components on the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application and control the URL's GET parameters.
*   **Path Traversal:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application and control the URL's GET parameters.
*   **XSS:**  The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application and inject code into the database.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit addresses these vulnerabilities by:
    *   Enclosing string variables in SQL queries inside single quotes and removing the curly brackets: `{$emp_id}` becomes `'{$emp_id}'`. This may prevent some SQL injection attacks, but does not prevent all of them.
    *   Using `safe_input()` function to sanitize the input before using in the SQL query in some places, this is a better protection.
    *   Removing path traversal characters (`./` and `../`) from user-supplied input before using it in file paths.
    *   Using `$("<div>").text(state.text).html()` to prevent XSS when inserting text in html elements.

*   The commit message "Fix security issue" indicates a focus on resolving identified security concerns.

This analysis provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Summary of Changes**
The changes made in the commit include:

*   **assets/js/bms.js**: Fixed XSS by encoding the text coming from select2 components before inserting them into html elements.
*   **assets/js/events.js**: Fixed XSS by encoding the text coming from select2 components before inserting them into `iledit` html elements.
*   **core/ajax/ajax_data.php:** Fixed SQL injection by sanitizing user inputs in multiple places with `safe_input()` and by enclosing string variables in SQL queries inside single quotes.
*   **core/ajax/ajax_select2.php:** Added a missing where clause to a query.
*   **core/functions.php**: Fixed path traversal by removing path traversal characters in the `easyUpload` function.
*   **core/route.php**: Fixed path traversal by removing path traversal characters from the `pageSlug` variable.
*   **include/apps/xhr/index.php**: Fixed path traversal by removing path traversal characters from the `module` variable.
*   **include/apps/xhr/info.php**: Fixed path traversal by removing path traversal characters from the `module` variable.
