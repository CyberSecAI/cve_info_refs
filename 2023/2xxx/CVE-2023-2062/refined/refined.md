Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The EtherNet/IP configuration tool displays passwords in plain text due to missing password field masking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Password Field Masking (CWE-549):** Passwords are not masked in the configuration tool, making them visible to anyone with access to the screen. This exposes the credentials, leading to potential unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can obtain the unmasked password and use it to bypass authentication for the FTP function on the EtherNet/IP modules.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the module via FTP.
*   **Potential Further Attacks:** Once authenticated, an attacker could upload/download files, view communication settings, or make modifications. This could lead to denial of service, unexpected communication, or act as a starting point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker could physically observe the screen while the configuration tool is in use or access the PC remotely via malicious means
*   **Network Access (Indirect):** An attacker who gains network access to a system running the tool could potentially view the unmasked password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have some form of access (physical or remote) to the system where the affected EtherNet/IP configuration tool is running to observe the unmasked password.
*   The attacker needs to use the unmasked password to access the module via FTP

**Affected Products:**

*   SW1DNN-EIPCT-BD: version 1.01B and prior
*   SW1DNN-EIPCTFX5-BD: version 1.01B and prior

**Mitigations:**

*   Update to the fixed versions Software version "1.02C" or later for both SW1DNN-EIPCT-BD and SW1DNN-EIPCTFX5-BD.
*   Restrict physical access to the PC where the product is installed and the network devices that can communicate with it.
*   Only allow trusted users to log in or remotely log in.
*   Ensure that no one else can see the screen while the product is in use.
*   Lock the PC if you leave your desk while using the product.
*   Use the PC using the product within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks or hosts.
*   Install antivirus software.
*   Do not open untrusted files or click on untrusted links.
