ESET remedied this possible attack vector and has prepared new builds of its products that are no longer susceptible to this vulnerability.

The reserved CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2023-2847. ESET evaluated the severity of this vulnerability as High, and the CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8 with the following vector: [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1).
