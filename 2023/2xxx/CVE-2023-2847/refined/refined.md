- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered during an internal security analysis.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a user with lower privileges to trigger actions with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation, where a low-privileged user can perform actions as root.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable ESET product is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the machine with the vulnerable ESET software installed. The attacker does not require user interaction (UI:N) to trigger the vulnerability. The complexity is rated as high (AC:H), suggesting that the exploitation might not be straightforward or might require specific conditions.
