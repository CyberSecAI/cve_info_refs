**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly escape a parameter before outputting it back into an attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection. The vulnerability can be exploited against high privilege users such as admin

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload in the `code` parameter, which if opened by a logged-in admin, triggers the XSS vulnerability.
`http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=njform-google-sheet-config&code="style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user, particularly a high-privilege user such as an administrator, into clicking the crafted link while logged into the WordPress administration panel.
