Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2184

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `search_term` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    - Defacing websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `search_term` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to find a way to trick a victim into clicking the malicious link (e.g., phishing).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable plugin is "WP Responsive Tabs horizontal vertical and accordion Tabs".
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 1.1.15.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.16 by implementing proper input sanitization using functions such as `sanitize_text_field` and output escaping using `esc_html`.
- The vulnerable parameters are:
    - `$_POST['vNonce']` - Fixed with `sanitize_text_field()`
    - `$_GET['order_by']` - Fixed with `esc_html(sanitize_text_field())`
    - `$_GET['order_pos']` - Fixed with `esc_html(sanitize_text_field())`
    - `$_GET['search_term']` - Fixed with `esc_html(sanitize_text_field())`
    - `$_GET['action']` - Fixed with `esc_html(sanitize_text_field())`
    - `$_GET['nonce']` - Fixed with `sanitize_text_field()`
