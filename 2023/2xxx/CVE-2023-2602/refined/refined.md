{
  "CVE-2023-2602": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The pthread_create() function in libcap has a flaw in its error handling, specifically in the __wrap_pthread_create() function. It incorrectly checks the return value of __real_pthread_create() for -1, while errors are indicated by positive numbers. This leads to a memory leak.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference",
      "Memory Leak",
	   "Incorrect error handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor, by causing the __real_pthread_create() function to return an error, can repeatedly trigger the memory leak, potentially leading to process memory exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation. A process that can influence the behavior of `pthread_create()` within the affected application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the local system and influence the execution flow to trigger errors in `pthread_create()`."
  }
