- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied parameters before outputting them into HTML attributes, leading to reflected XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by a victim, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the victim, such as session hijacking, account compromise, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters (`fetchsheetDataEle` and `code`). The victim, typically a logged-in administrator, needs to be tricked into visiting this malicious URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in administrator to visit it. They do not need to have any prior access to the WordPress system.
