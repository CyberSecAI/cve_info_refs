Hello Kubernetes Community,

A security issue was discovered in secrets-store-csi-driver where an actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens.  These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions.  Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

This issue has been rated **MEDIUM** [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) (6.5), and assigned **CVE-2023-2878**

**Am I vulnerable?**

You may be vulnerable if [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

To check if token requests are configured, run the following command:

kubectl get csidriver [secrets-store.csi.k8s.io](http://secrets-store.csi.k8s.io) -o jsonpath="{.spec.tokenRequests}"

To check if tokens are being logged, examine the secrets-store container log:

kubectl logs -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver -c secrets-store -f | grep --line-buffered "[csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens](http://csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens)"

**Affected Versions**

- secrets-store-csi-driver < 1.3.3

**How do I mitigate this vulnerability?**

Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by running secrets-store-csi-driver at log level 0 or 1 via the -v flag.

**Fixed Versions**

- secrets-store-csi-driver >= 1.3.3

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: <https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades>

**D****etection**

Examine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact secu...@kubernetes.io

**Acknowledgements**

This vulnerability was reported by Tomer Shaiman @tshaiman from Microsoft.

Thank You,

Mo Khan on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@enj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7001223?u=7723cbf95d18de87098abaa1a99a43cbfc31f69c&v=4&size=48)[enj](https://github.com/enj)opened [on Jun 2, 2023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118419#issue-1738671677)

A security issue was discovered in [secrets-store-csi-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver) where an actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens. These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions. Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

This issue has been rated **MEDIUM** [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) (6.5), and assigned **[CVE-2023-2878](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g82w-58jf-gcxx "CVE-2023-2878")**

**Am I vulnerable?**

You may be vulnerable if [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

To check if token requests are configured, run the following command:

```
kubectl get csidriver secrets-store.csi.k8s.io -o jsonpath="{.spec.tokenRequests}"
```

To check if tokens are being logged, examine the secrets-store container log:

```
kubectl logs -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver -c secrets-store -f | grep --line-buffered "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens"
```

**Affected Versions**

* secrets-store-csi-driver < 1.3.3

**How do I mitigate this vulnerability?**

Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by running secrets-store-csi-driver at log level 0 or 1 via the -v flag.

**Fixed Versions**

* secrets-store-csi-driver >= 1.3.3

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: <https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades>

**Detection**

Examine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io

**Acknowledgements**

This vulnerability was reported by Tomer Shaiman `@tshaiman` from Microsoft.
