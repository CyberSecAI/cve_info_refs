The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `id` GET parameter in the `/expense_budget/admin/budget/manage_budget.php` file. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the unsanitized `id` GET parameter into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive data)
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    - Data corruption
    - Denial of service (impacting application availability)
    - Potential for privilege escalation or remote code execution if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` GET parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the `/expense_budget/admin/budget/manage_budget.php` endpoint, and be able to manipulate the `id` parameter within that request. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
