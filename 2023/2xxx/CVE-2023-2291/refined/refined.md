Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of **static (hardcoded) credentials** for the PostgreSQL database used by ManageEngine Access Manager Plus (AMP), ManageEngine Password Manager Pro, and ManageEngine PAM360.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of hardcoded credentials for the PostgreSQL database. This allows unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Insecure Permission Handling:** Although the PostgreSQL database server runs under the SYSTEM account, which is a member of the local Administrators group, its membership is only checked for deny permissions, not allow. This prevents the SYSTEM account from performing administrative tasks directly through the database.
*   **Configuration File Manipulation:** A low-privileged user can leverage the hardcoded database credentials to modify the application's configuration files, specifically `security-common-onpremise.xml` and `web.xml`.
*   **JSP File Upload:** The user can upload a malicious JSP file to the application's web root directory and execute it within the security context of the application's service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can achieve full administrative privileges on the affected system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands by adding a malicious JSP file and modifying configuration files to permit execution, which allows the attacker to gain the privileges of the service account.
*   **Configuration Data Modification:** Attackers can use the hardcoded credentials to modify the application's configuration, which would lead to full system takeover and other potentially malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows host where the vulnerable ManageEngine product is installed.
*   **PostgreSQL Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the local PostgreSQL instance using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to certain configuration files and the web application directory using commands executed through the database connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the host machine.
*   **Access to PostgreSQL Client:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands via a PostgreSQL client and the ability to connect to the database using hardcoded credentials.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated using a proof-of-concept that involves:
    *   Creating a low-privileged user.
    *   Creating a malicious JSP file.
    *   Connecting to the PostgreSQL server using the hardcoded password ("Stonebraker").
    *   Copying the malicious JSP file to the web application directory.
    *   Modifying `security-common-onpremise.xml` to allow access to the malicious JSP file.
    *   Modifying `web.xml` to allow JSP execution.
    *   Restarting the ManageEngine service.
    *   Executing the JSP file via an HTTP request to gain admin privileges.

**Affected Products:**

*   ManageEngine Access Manager Plus (AMP)
*   ManageEngine Password Manager Pro
*   ManageEngine PAM360

**Solution:**

*   There is no vendor-supplied solution provided in the document. It advises contacting ManageEngine support for mitigation assistance.
