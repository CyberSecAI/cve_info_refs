      "description": "The TLS protocol configured with `quarkus.http.ssl.protocols` is not enforced, and the client can force the selection of the weaker supported TLS protocol.",
       "affected_component": "quarkus-core",
      "root_cause": "The application does not enforce the TLS protocol specified in its configuration.",

      "description": "Infinite recursion is triggered in Jettison when constructing a JSONArray from a Collection that contains a self-reference in one of its elements. This leads to a StackOverflowError exception being thrown.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request or data that will be processed by the vulnerable component and lead to the self referencing loop."
