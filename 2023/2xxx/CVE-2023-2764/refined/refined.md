Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ajax_set_featured_image` function in the Draw Attention plugin lacked proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin failed to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to modify the featured image of a post. Specifically, it did not check for the 'edit_post' capability before allowing the featured image to be changed.
- **Insecure AJAX endpoint:** The `wp_ajax_dgd_set_featured_image` action was vulnerable due to the missing capability check, allowing unauthorized users to invoke it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Featured Image Modification:** An attacker could change the featured image of any post on the WordPress site, even without having the rights to edit the post. This could lead to:
    - Defacement of the website by replacing featured images with inappropriate content.
    - Misinformation by altering the visual representation of articles or posts.
    - Potential SEO manipulation through altered images.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network via the WordPress AJAX API.
- **AJAX request:** The attacker sends a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable `wp_ajax_dgd_set_featured_image` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user, with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Knowledge of the plugin's AJAX endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable AJAX action (`dgd_set_featured_image`).
- **Knowledge of post ID and attachment ID:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the post they want to modify and the ID of the image in the media library they want to use as the new featured image.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.12 of the plugin by adding a capability check (`current_user_can( 'edit_post', $postID )`) and nonce verification to the `ajax_set_featured_image` function.
- The Wordfence article provides additional context, including the CVSS score and researcher information.
- The Trac logs show the code changes in the patch that added the missing authorization and nonce checks to the `ajax_set_featured_image` function, preventing unathorized users from modifying post featured images.
