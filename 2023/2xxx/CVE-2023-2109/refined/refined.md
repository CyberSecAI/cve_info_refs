Based on the provided content, the commit `a06a5a574ad908b0ef2db7b47d05c3774eeb493d` in the `chatwoot/chatwoot` repository changes the way text is set within the chat widget's bubble. Specifically, it replaces the use of `innerHTML` with `innerText`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit message indicates the use of `innerText` instead of `innerHTML` as a fix. This suggests the previous use of `innerHTML` was potentially vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. `innerHTML` renders HTML content, thus executing any script included within the text which is not the case with innerText

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The use of `innerHTML` to set the bubble text could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code if the `bubbleText` variable was not properly sanitized.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to:
    *   Data theft
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the webpage
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the `bubbleText` variable if it originates from an untrusted source or isn't properly sanitized by the application logic that sets `bubbleText`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to find a way to control or influence the data being used to populate the bubble's text (`bubbleText`). This could involve compromising other parts of the application or using existing functionality that doesn't perform proper sanitization or validation of input.

**Additional details:**

The commit modifies the `app/javascript/sdk/bubbleHelpers.js` file to replace `textNode.innerHTML = bubbleText;` with `textNode.innerText = bubbleText;` which prevents the execution of malicious scripts. This provides more detail than the typical description provided with CVEs and allows us to understand the vulnerability at a code level.
