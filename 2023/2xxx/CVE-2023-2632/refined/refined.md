The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins. Here's the breakdown for the specific CVE-2023-2632:

**CVE-2023-2632**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Code Dx Plugin stores Code Dx server API keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Plaintext Storage:** API keys are stored in plaintext, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Insufficient Masking:** The job configuration form does not mask the API keys, increasing the risk of exposure during configuration.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exposure of API keys allows unauthorized users to potentially access and manipulate the Code Dx server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Users with `Item/Extended Read` permission can view the `config.xml` files.
    *   Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can directly read the `config.xml` files.
    *   Attackers can observe and capture the API keys directly from the job configuration form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs `Item/Extended Read` permission or access to the Jenkins controller's file system, or be able to view the job configuration form.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document also mentions a related issue, CVE-2023-2633, which deals with the lack of masking of the same API keys.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves no longer directly storing the API keys and instead using the Jenkins Credentials Plugin to manage the keys.
*   Affected jobs need to be reconfigured.
