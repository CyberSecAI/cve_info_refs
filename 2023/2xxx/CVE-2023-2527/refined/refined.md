Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, depending on the database setup and privileges. The provided PoC demonstrates a time-based SQL injection, which can be used to exfiltrate data.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the WordPress admin interface, specifically targeting the `orderby` parameter of the `vxcf_zoho` page. The vulnerable parameter is `crm_id`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative privileges on the WordPress site to access the vulnerable page in the admin panel.
