  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-2575",
    "description": "The web server is prone to a buffer overflow, triggered due to missing input length validation in the NTP input field. According to the vendor, the NTP server string is expected to be 64 bytes long, which is not correctly checked.",
    "root_cause": "Missing input length validation in the NTP input field.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution (not explicitly stated but implied with buffer overflows) and denial of service with the device becoming unresponsive. Forked child processes remain as zombie processes.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the device's web server with an overly long NTP server name.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have network access to the device and be able to send HTTP requests. Authentication is also required to reach the vulnerable functionality.",
    "affected_products": [
        "Advantech EKI-1524-CE series / 1.21",
