Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `loginAction` function of the `LoginController`. Specifically, the `too_many_attempts` parameter from the request is being directly included in the `params` array which is then used to render the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was not properly sanitizing the `too_many_attempts` parameter. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this parameter, which would then be executed in the victim's browser when the login page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in the victim's browser:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, the attacker can perform actions in the victim's browser on behalf of the victim. This could be used to steal cookies, perform actions on the user's account, redirect the user to a malicious page, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the `too_many_attempts` parameter of the GET request made to the login page. For example, an attacker might send a request like `/admin/login?too_many_attempts=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request with the malicious payload to the login page.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix is in the line:
  `$params['error'] = SecurityHelper::convertHtmlSpecialChars($request->get('too_many_attempts'));`
This shows that they are now escaping the HTML special characters within the `too_many_attempts` variable in order to prevent the XSS.
- The commit message `fixed xss on login page` and the pull request reference `[#14975](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14975)` confirms that this commit is addressing a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- The code change in `bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Admin/LoginController.php` shows the specific fix by escaping the `too_many_attempts` parameter.
