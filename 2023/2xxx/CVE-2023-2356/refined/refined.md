The provided content relates to the commit `f73147496e05c09a8b83d95fb4f1bf86696c6342` in the `mlflow/mlflow` repository, which addresses a vulnerability related to relative paths in model version sources.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to provide relative paths within the source parameter when creating model versions in MLflow.  This could allow an attacker to potentially access files outside the intended directory on the tracking server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting a malicious source URL with relative path components (e.g., `../`), an attacker could try to navigate the file system of the server hosting the MLflow tracking service.
- **Insecure Input Handling:** The server was not properly validating the source parameter, failing to identify and block relative path references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the MLflow tracking server, potentially exposing sensitive data, configuration files, or even credentials.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to arbitrary files on the server could be a stepping stone for further malicious activities like server compromise or data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted API Request:** The attacker would need to send a specially crafted API request to the `mlflow/model-versions/create` endpoint. This request would include a "source" parameter containing a malicious relative path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the MLflow tracking server API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker would need to be aware of the `mlflow/model-versions/create` API endpoint and its parameters.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads to the API endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

The commit introduces a new function `_validate_non_local_source_contains_relative_paths` that checks if the provided source contains any relative path indicators. It uses `urllib.parse.urlparse` to parse the source and `pathlib.Path(...).resolve()` to resolve relative paths in the source.  It then checks that the resolved path does not differ from the original path given to detect use of relative pathing.

Additionally, new test cases were added to verify that relative paths in non-local sources are rejected, and that valid remote URI sources are accepted.
