Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way phpMyFAQ handles email address verification during user updates, specifically within the `ajaxservice.php` file and the `User.php` file. The code was susceptible to manipulation where a user could potentially update another user's password by manipulating the email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Email Address Manipulation:** The `getUserIdByEmail()` function in `User.php` was returning the `user_id` without proper type casting. This function is called in `ajaxservice.php` to check if the user id matches the given email, allowing for manipulation. 
2. **Missing Type Check**: The original code did not properly typecast the result of `$userData['user_id']` to an integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the email address to trigger the `User ID / email mismatch!` condition and change the password of a different user. This was possible due to the type confusion of the user id returned by the `getUserIdByEmail` function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the user update mechanism in `ajaxservice.php`, specifically when processing a password change request.
*   The attacker needs to manipulate the `email` parameter to trick the `getUserIdByEmail()` function to not return the expected id, but still pass the equality check in `ajaxservice.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user and have knowledge of the system, specifically the endpoints used to update user information.
*   They need the ability to modify the email parameter in the update request to exploit the type confusion in `User.php` and pass the user id validation check.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is a commit diff, not a full description, so the specific exploitation details are inferred from the code changes.
* The commit message "fix: avoid possible email address manipulation" indicates that the vulnerability was related to how email addresses were being handled.
* The fix ensures that the user id returned by the `getUserIdByEmail` function is an integer using an explicit type cast `(int)$userData['user\_id']`, preventing the bypass of the user id check.
