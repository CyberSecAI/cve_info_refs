- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when an admin user views the plugin's settings page. This can lead to various malicious actions such as cookie theft, session hijacking, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JavaScript payloads into the Query, Keyword, and/or Intent fields of the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access (or a high-privilege user role) to the WordPress site. The attacker also needs to be able to access the plugin settings page.
