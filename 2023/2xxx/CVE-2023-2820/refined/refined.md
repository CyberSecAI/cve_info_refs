- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the faye endpoint of Proofpoint Threat Response / Threat Response Auto-Pull (PTR/TRAP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of credentials to integrated services. This is due to a lack of proper security measures on the faye endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain credentials to integrated services. With these credentials, the attacker can impersonate PTR/TRAP to those services.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker on an adjacent network can exploit this vulnerability through a man-in-the-middle position or by cryptanalysis of the session traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to the vulnerable system and must be capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack or cryptanalysis of session traffic.
