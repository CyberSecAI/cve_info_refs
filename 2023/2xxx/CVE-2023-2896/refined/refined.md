Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2896

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper nonce validation in the `process_duplicate_product` function within the WP EasyCart plugin. Nonce validation is a security measure to ensure that requests are coming from legitimate users and not forged by attackers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF flaw. The absence of adequate nonce validation allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, can perform unintended actions on their behalf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Product Duplication:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to duplicate products on the website. This could lead to unwanted content proliferation, potentially impacting store management and inventory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Request:** Attackers create a malicious request targeting the `process_duplicate_product` function.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into executing the forged request. This is commonly done through actions like clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need to have an account or access to the WordPress admin panel.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in WP EasyCart versions up to and including 5.4.8.
- It was patched in version 5.4.9.
