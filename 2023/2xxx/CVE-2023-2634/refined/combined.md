## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Get Your Number <= 1.1.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. In the plugin's settings, enter the payload "><script>alert(1)</script> in the event\_name field.
2. Reload the page and see the XSS.
