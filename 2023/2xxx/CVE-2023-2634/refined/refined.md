- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the `event_name` field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages. This could lead to various malicious actions, like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other unauthorized activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the plugin's settings page and insert the malicious script in the vulnerable field (`event_name`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress installation.
