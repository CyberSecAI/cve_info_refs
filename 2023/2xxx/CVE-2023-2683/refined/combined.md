## News

### New Simplicity SDK and updated GSDK

We've released a new Simplicity SDK ([simplicity\_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/simplicity_sdk); please note the new repository) focused on our Series 2 and our upcoming Series 3 products. The GSDK ([gecko\_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk)) continues to be available and provides long-term support for our Series 0 and Series 1 devices. For more information, visit our [SDK Release Notes](https://www.silabs.com/developers/software-development-kit-release-notes) page.

### My git clone stopped working with an LFS error. What could be the cause?

On December 13th, 2023, the git LFS server changed and enabled a bandwidth quota based on your IP address. Go [here](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/.github) for more information on how to resolve this issue.
