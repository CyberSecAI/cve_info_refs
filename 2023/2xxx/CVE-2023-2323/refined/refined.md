Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-2323:

**1. Verification:**
   - The commit message "Fix XSS in name parameter of Pricing Rules" directly relates to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is a common type of security issue addressed by CVE entries.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "name" parameter in the Pricing Rules functionality. Specifically, the "name" parameter was not being correctly sanitized or encoded when displayed, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application was not properly encoding or sanitizing the `name` field of pricing rules. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious javascript into the `name` parameter, that would be executed in the browser of a victim viewing the application.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript through the `name` parameter, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of a victim's browser session.
   - **Session Hijacking:** Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking by stealing cookies.
   - **Data Theft:** Attackers can use XSS to steal sensitive data displayed on the page.
   - **Defacement:** The application's appearance can be altered by injected scripts.
   - **Redirection:**  Users could be redirected to malicious websites without their knowledge.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious Input:** An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into the `name` field of a pricing rule, likely during the creation or editing process.
   - **User Interaction:** The malicious script would be executed when a user views the pricing rule details, either in the admin interface or in a potentially affected public-facing view.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User (likely):** The attacker would likely need to have a valid account within the application with the capability to create or modify pricing rules.
   - **Knowledge of Application Functionality:** Some knowledge of the application's pricing rules functionality and its handling of input fields would be necessary.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:**
    *   `bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/PricingManager/Rule.php`: The fix involves sanitizing the input by using `SecurityHelper::convertHtmlSpecialChars($name)` when setting the name
    *   `bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/Resources/public/js/pricing/config/panel.js`: The fix involves using `Ext.util.Format.htmlEncode` on `record.data.text` before using it in a confirmation dialog.

*   **Specific Changes:**
    *   In `Rule.php`, the `setName` function now sanitizes the `name` using `SecurityHelper::convertHtmlSpecialChars` before storing it.
    *   In `panel.js`, the `deleteRule` function is modified to encode the name before display.

**Summary:**

The provided content reveals a stored XSS vulnerability within the Pimcore application. By exploiting the lack of input sanitization in the "name" field of Pricing Rules, attackers could inject and execute malicious scripts, potentially compromising the application and its users. The commit addresses this by encoding potentially malicious characters in the name parameter before it is stored and displayed.
