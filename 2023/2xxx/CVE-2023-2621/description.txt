The McFeeder server (distributed as part of SSW package), is susceptible to an arbitrary file write vulnerability on the MAIN computer
system. This vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated version of a third-party library, which is used to extract archives uploaded to McFeeder server. An authenticated malicious client can
exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted ZIP archive via the
network to McFeederâ€™s service endpoint.
