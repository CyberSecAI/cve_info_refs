Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2017

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2023-22731 in Shopware 6. The `Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig\SecurityExtension` class was intended to prevent the execution of arbitrary PHP functions via Twig filters (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`). However, the validation checks were insufficient, and the code failed to validate non-string callables (specifically, arrays representing callables), allowing arbitrary PHP functions to be called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core issue is the ability to inject malicious code into Twig templates.
*   **Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs (CWE-184):** The security extension didn't properly restrict the types of callables that could be passed to the vulnerable Twig filters.
*  **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine (CWE-1336):** The vulnerability arises from improper handling of user-provided input within a template engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code/commands on the server hosting the Shopware application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other severe impacts.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Through RCE, attackers can gain full control over the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Twig Template Manipulation:** Exploitation occurs via crafted Twig templates that utilize the vulnerable filters with malicious array-based callables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Twig Environment:** The attacker needs access to a Twig environment where they can inject malicious code. This could be achieved through:
    *   Having administrative privileges.
    *   Having permissions to create/edit Twig templates, such as email templates, theme templates or manage extensions.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The `SecurityExtension` class in Shopware attempts to filter function calls within Twig templates, specifically when using the `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `sort` filters.
*   The validation logic only checks if the argument passed to those filters is a string and if that string is in an allow list.
*   When an array is passed instead of a string as a callable, the validation is skipped.
*   PHP allows callables to be passed as arrays.
*   Attackers can pass an array containing the class name and the method to invoke a static method.
*   Attackers can chain these function calls to trigger arbitrary PHP execution, for instance using `unserialize()` with a crafted payload, or `system()` directly.

**Exploitation Examples:**
The provided examples include using `CacheValueCompressor::uncompress`, `VarDumper::setHandler`, `VarDumper::dump`, and `Process::fromShellCommandline` to achieve RCE.

**Mitigation:**
The suggested mitigation is to modify the `SecurityExtension` class to ensure that only strings and `Closure` objects are passed as callable parameters, thus preventing the use of array-based callables. Specifically, the conditional check was changed from:

```php
if (\is_string($function) && !\in_array($function, $this->allowedPHPFunctions, true)) {
```
to
```php
if (!($function instanceof \Closure) && (!(\is_string($function) && \in_array($function, $this->allowedPHPFunctions, true))) {
```
**Detection Guidance:**
*   Search for `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, or `sort` within Twig cache files and custom apps/plugins/themes.
*   Examine PHP logs for any errors or warnings related to failed exploitation attempts.

**Affected Versions:**
Shopware versions v6.4.18.1 to v6.4.20.0 and v6.5.0.0-rc1 to v6.5.0.0-rc4

**Patched Versions:**
Shopware version 6.4.20.1
