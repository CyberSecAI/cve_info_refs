- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `delete_bus` functionality in the Bus Dispatch and Information System is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or potentially gain control of the system by exploiting the SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user input processed by the `delete_bus` function. If the function does not sanitize or parameterize input before using it in an SQL query, it becomes vulnerable to injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker likely needs to be able to interact with the system's `delete_bus` function through its user interface or API. This would require being an authenticated user (or potentially a guest user if not properly secured).
