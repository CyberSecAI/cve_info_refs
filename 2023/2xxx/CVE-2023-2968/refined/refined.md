- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Usage of an undefined variable `socket.remoteAddress` in the npm package "proxy".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The code doesn't handle cases where `socket.remoteAddress` is undefined, leading to a TypeError exception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request that results in `socket.remoteAddress` being undefined. Specifically, sending a valid HTTP GET request followed by invalid tail data triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
