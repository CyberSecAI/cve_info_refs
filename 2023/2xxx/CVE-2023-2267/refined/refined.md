- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software does not properly validate user-supplied input, leading to a reflection attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform reflection attacks against an authorized and authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating input provided to the SEL-411L.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input that is processed by the SEL-411L, and the target user needs to be authenticated.
