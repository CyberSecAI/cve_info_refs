# CVE-2023-2455

### Row security policies disregard user ID changes after inlining

While [CVE-2016-2193](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2016-2193/) fixed most interaction between row security and user ID changes, it missed a scenario involving function inlining. This leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles. This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple `SET ROLE`s. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used [`CREATE POLICY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) to define a row security policy.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Wolfgang Walther for reporting this problem.
