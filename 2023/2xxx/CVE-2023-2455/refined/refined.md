Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-2455:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how PostgreSQL handles row security policies when function inlining is involved. Specifically, the system fails to properly account for changes in the user ID after a query is planned but before it is executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Row Security Policy Application:** Row security policies are designed to control access to data based on user roles. However, due to the identified flaw, when a query is planned under one role and then executed under another, the policy applied might be the one corresponding to the planning role, rather than the executing role.
*   **Function Inlining Issue:** The vulnerability is triggered by function inlining, which is a performance optimization that integrates function code directly into the caller. This optimization interacts incorrectly with user ID changes, causing the row security policy to be evaluated under an incorrect context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can potentially bypass intended row security policies to complete otherwise-forbidden read and modification operations. This allows them to access data they should not have permission to see or manipulate.
*   **Data Breach:** The disclosure of sensitive information and unauthorized modification can lead to data breaches and integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Security Definer Functions:** The vulnerability can be exploited within security definer functions. These functions execute with the privileges of the function owner, rather than the caller.
*   **SET ROLE:** Exploitation can occur when a common user and query is initially planned and then reused across multiple `SET ROLE` operations. `SET ROLE` changes the effective user identity for the current session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low-level database privileges.
*   **Ability to trigger planning and execution under different roles:** The attacker needs to be able to somehow cause a query to be planned under one role and then executed under another, leveraging either security definer functions or `SET ROLE` operations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects only databases that have used `CREATE POLICY` to define row security policies.
*   The PostgreSQL project explicitly thanks Wolfgang Walther for reporting this problem.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in PostgreSQL versions 15.3, 14.8, 13.11, 12.15, and 11.20.

**CVSS Score:**
*   The CVSS v3 score is 4.2 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, which means:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: High
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality Impact: Low
    *   Integrity Impact: Low
    *   Availability Impact: None

**NetApp Products:**

* The provided NetApp document indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate vulnerable PostgreSQL versions. Specifically, Brocade SAN Navigator (SANnav) is listed as an affected product, with fixes available in SANnav versions 2.3.0a and 2.3.1.
