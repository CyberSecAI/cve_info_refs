- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the `blog_in_blog` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with editor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via the `blog_in_blog` shortcode by injecting malicious scripts within the shortcode's attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users with editor-level or higher permissions.
