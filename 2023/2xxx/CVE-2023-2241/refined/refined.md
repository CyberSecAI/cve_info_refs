The provided content relates to CVE-2023-2241.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `readXRefStreamEntry` function of the PoDoFo library when parsing a malformed PDF file. Specifically, the code doesn't properly validate the length of the data being read from the cross-reference stream, leading to out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `readXRefStreamEntry` function attempts to read beyond allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash, demonstrated by the ASAN error report.
- Potential for code execution: While the provided information does not explicitly state code execution, heap buffer overflows are often leveraged for that purpose.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted cross-reference stream that triggers the vulnerability when processed by PoDoFo.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of the PoDoFo library.
- No specific attacker position/capabilities beyond this are mentioned

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #69 of the podofo github repository, and fixed by commit `535a786`.
- The vulnerability exists in `podofo-0.10.0/src/podofo/main/PdfXRefStreamParserObject.cpp:180:75`
- The fix involves validating entry lengths in `PdfXRefStreamParserObject::parseStream` and replacing `cursor+=entryLen;` with `offset += entryLen;` and `readXRefStreamEntry` uses `buffer.data() + offset` instead of `cursor`.
- The vulnerability is triggered in `PdfXRefStreamParserObject::readXRefStreamEntry`, during the parsing of a cross-reference stream (xref stream).
- The vulnerability was not found to be present in version 0.9.8.
- The provided ASAN output shows a heap buffer overflow when reading one byte at address `0x6070000000d1`, which is outside of the allocated 65-byte region.
