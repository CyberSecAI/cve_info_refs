Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2796:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication and authorization in the `eventon_ics_download` AJAX action within the EventON and EventON Lite WordPress plugins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly check user permissions before allowing access to event data.
*   **Missing Authorization:** Unauthenticated users can directly trigger the `eventon_ics_download` action.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access to private events:** Attackers can access event details, including those that are intended to be private or password-protected, by guessing the numeric IDs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information contained within event details might be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=eventon_ics_download` parameter and a guessed event ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No authentication is required:** An attacker does not need a user account on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of plugin's endpoint:** An attacker needs to know the AJAX action name (`eventon_ics_download`).
*   **Ability to guess event IDs:** The attacker needs to guess the numerical IDs of the events they want to access.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

*   The vulnerability affects both EventON and EventON Lite plugins.
*   The issue is fixed in versions 2.1.2 of EventON Lite and 4.4 of EventON.
