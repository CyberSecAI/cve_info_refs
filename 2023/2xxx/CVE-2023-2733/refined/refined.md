Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user ID supplied during coupon redemption requests via the MStore API plugin's REST API. Specifically, the `/coupon` endpoint in `flutter-woo.php` does not properly authenticate the user before applying a coupon, which relies on a `customer_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks in the `coupon` function. An attacker can supply any valid user ID via the `customer_id` parameter and the plugin will set the current user to that ID.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The REST API endpoint `/coupon` can be accessed by unauthenticated users without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can impersonate any user on the WordPress site, including administrators, if they know the user's ID.
*   **Full Site Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full site takeover, allowing attackers to modify content, install malicious plugins or themes, and perform other malicious actions due to the possibility of gaining admin level access.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information related to user accounts and orders.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through the plugin's REST API.
*   **REST API Requests:** Attackers can send crafted POST requests to the `/coupon` endpoint of the MStore API plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess a valid user ID of the WordPress site.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MStore API plugin versions up to and including 3.9.0.
*   The vulnerable code can be found in the `coupon` function of the `flutter-woo.php` file.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 3.9.1.
*   Wordfence has blocked attacks exploiting this vulnerability.
*   The fix involved adding cookie based authentication in addition to the existing customer\_id based authentication.
