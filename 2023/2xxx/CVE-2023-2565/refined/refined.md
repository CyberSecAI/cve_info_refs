The provided content describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application located at `/sparkz/ajax.php`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. Specifically, the `complaint_type` POST parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application saves user input from the `complaint_type` parameter without proper sanitization, leading to persistent script injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will execute in the browser of any user visiting the page at `<http://localhost/sparkz/index.php?complain>`. This could lead to:
  - Cookie theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions within the user's browser context

**Attack vectors:**
- POST request: The attacker sends a POST request to `/sparkz/ajax.php` with the following parameters:
  `complainant_name=1&complaint_type=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&complaint=2&createComplaint=`
- User interaction: The injected script is triggered when a user visits `<http://localhost/sparkz/index.php?complain>`, displaying the cookie of the user and executing arbitrary javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific privilege level is required; any user able to interact with the form can inject the script.
