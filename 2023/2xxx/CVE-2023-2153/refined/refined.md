Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `editable_ajax.php` file of a "Complaint Management System". Specifically, the POST parameter `value` is directly used in the application's response without encoding or sanitizing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application echoes user-supplied input (`value` parameter) directly into the HTML output without proper encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application by controlling the `value` parameter.
*   This code can be executed within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies using `document.cookie`.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware delivery:** Injecting code that downloads malware.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted POST request is sent to `/Complaint Management System/admin/assets/plugins/DataTables/examples/examples_support/editable_ajax.php` with the malicious JavaScript payload in the `value` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No special privileges are required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability with standard user access.

**Payloads:**

The provided payloads in the document are:
*   `value=1><script>alert(666)</script>` - Displays an alert box with the message "666".
*   `value=1><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` - Displays an alert box containing the user's cookies.
