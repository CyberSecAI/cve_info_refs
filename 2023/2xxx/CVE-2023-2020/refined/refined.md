- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient permission checks in the REST API when scheduling downtimes for services. Users could schedule downtimes even if they lacked the necessary permissions for the affected host and service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Missing permission validation in the REST API endpoint for service downtimes. Specifically, the API was not verifying user permissions for `wato.downtimes` as well as access to the host and service being modified.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with low-level access could schedule downtimes for any service, potentially disrupting monitoring and operations even if they lack the specific "wato.downtimes" permission or access to a specific host/service. This is primarily an impact to Integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The REST API endpoint used to schedule service downtimes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account that has access to the API (low-privileged).
