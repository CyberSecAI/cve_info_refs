Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the deserialization of untrusted data within the 'go_pricing' shortcode's 'data' parameter in the Go Pricing WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection due to the insecure deserialization of user-supplied data.
  - **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin directly deserializes the 'data' parameter without proper validation or sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary PHP objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Code Execution:** If a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain exists in another installed plugin or theme, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.
  - **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete files on the server.
  - **Sensitive Data Retrieval:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Shortcode Parameter:** The 'data' parameter of the 'go_pricing' shortcode is the primary attack vector. This parameter is vulnerable to having malicious serialized PHP objects passed to it.
  - **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least subscriber-level permissions on the WordPress site.
  - **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to use the vulnerable 'go_pricing' shortcode.
  - **POP Chain (Conditional):** To achieve the full impact of remote code execution, the attacker needs a suitable POP chain in another plugin or theme. If no POP chain is available, the impact of exploitation is reduced.

The provided information gives a good overview of the vulnerability. It specifically mentions that no POP chain exists in the vulnerable plugin itself, and that a POP chain in other plugins or themes is required for full exploitation. This level of detail is more than what is generally found in a basic CVE description.
