Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `delete_service` function within the `Master.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the POST request is directly embedded into an SQL query without any form of escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially delete, modify, or extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation, where an attacker gains higher access levels.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By injecting SQL statements that cause database errors or overload the system, an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `classes/Master.php?f=delete_service` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter within the POST request's body, which is used in the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.
*   **Understanding of SQL syntax:** To construct malicious queries, the attacker must have a good understanding of SQL syntax.
*   **Ability to intercept/modify HTTP requests**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a modified POST request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how the `id` parameter can be manipulated to inject SQL code. The provided SQL injection payload is `id='+AND+GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x717a6a7071%2C(SELECT+(ELT(8125%3D8125%2C1)))%2C0x71707a7071)%2C8125)--+jKyA`, which shows a blind SQL injection attack.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $del = $this->conn->query("DELETE FROM `service_list` where id = '{$id}'");
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detailed information than the typical CVE description, including the specific vulnerable file, function, and parameter, along with a POC.
*   The content mentions the use of `sqlmap` for the detection and verification of the vulnerability.
