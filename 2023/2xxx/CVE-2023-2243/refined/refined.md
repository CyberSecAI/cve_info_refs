- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `fullname` parameter in the `/Complaint Management System/users/registration.php` script is directly used in an SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or denial of service. The provided payloads specifically use the `sleep()` function to demonstrate the successful injection and the ability to influence server-side execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a POST request to the `/Complaint Management System/users/registration.php` endpoint, with a malicious SQL query injected into the `fullname` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No special privileges are required.
