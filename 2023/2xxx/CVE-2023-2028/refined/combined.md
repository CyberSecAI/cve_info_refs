## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Call Now Accessibility Button < 1.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In the plugin's "Quick Start" field, add the payload: `"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`
2. Save the changes, submit the request and you will see the XSS exploit.
