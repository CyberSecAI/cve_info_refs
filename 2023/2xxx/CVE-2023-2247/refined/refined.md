- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The variable preview function in affected versions of Octopus Deploy can unmask secrets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information. Specifically, the variable preview feature improperly handles secret variables, leading to their values being revealed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information by viewing the unmasked secret variables, leading to unauthorized access or compromise of systems and data.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved through the variable preview function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user of Octopus Deploy and have the ability to view variable previews.
