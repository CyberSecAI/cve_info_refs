- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded passwords within the FTP functionality of the EtherNet/IP unit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded password (CWE-259).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who obtains the hardcoded password can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the unit. This access allows for further malicious activities including viewing, modifying, deleting or corrupting data as well as using the device as a starting point for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the FTP service on the affected units.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected device, and the knowledge/possession of the hardcoded credentials.
