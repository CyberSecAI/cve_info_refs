{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was not properly sanitizing user-provided input used in grid configurations, specifically within the `AnyGetter` operator and predefined metadata, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Unsanitized user input in grid configurations allows injection of malicious scripts. The vulnerable areas include the label, attribute and parameter fields of the AnyGetter operator and the name field of predefined metadata.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of a user's browser, potentially enabling attackers to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, deface the application, or perform other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to manipulate grid configurations, specifically by inserting malicious JavaScript into the label, attribute, or parameter fields of the `AnyGetter` operator, or the name of predefined metadata.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have the ability to modify the grid configurations, which would typically require an authenticated user with sufficient privileges within the application."
