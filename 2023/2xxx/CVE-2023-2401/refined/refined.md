- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Qubotchat plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user, such as an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected settings or pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by adding a malicious script tag to the "Text This" field of a chatbot button configuration within the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the plugin settings.
