## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Qubotchat < 1.1.6 – Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a "button" to the chatbot
2. In the "Text This" field, add: `<img src=/ onerror=alert("XSS")>`
3. Reload and see XSS.
