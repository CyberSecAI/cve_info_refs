Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2114:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLI) flaw in the NEX-Forms WordPress plugin.
*   The plugin fails to properly escape or sanitize the `table` parameter, which is supplied via user input. This parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct parameter concatenation:** The vulnerable `table` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
*   This could lead to various impacts, including data breaches (reading sensitive information), data manipulation (modifying data), or even complete database compromise. The CVSS score of 4.1 (Medium) indicates a potential impact of data loss and limited control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the vulnerable `table` parameter.
*   **`action=nf_update_record`:** The POST request targets the `nf_update_record` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs administrator-level access (Admin+) to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send crafted requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests with the malicious `table` parameter.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was present in NEX-Forms plugin versions before 8.4.
*   The `edit_Id`, `plugin`, and `title` parameters are present in the proof of concept, but the vulnerability resides in the `table` parameter.
* The provided github link contains a proof of concept and further details about the vulnerability.
