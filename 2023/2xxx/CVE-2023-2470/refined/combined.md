## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Add to Feedly <= 1.2.11 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings, allowing high-privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Install the plugin and insert the following payload in the field "Feed URL (http://...)":
1"<script>alert(1)</script>
Save the form and the payload will be executed.
