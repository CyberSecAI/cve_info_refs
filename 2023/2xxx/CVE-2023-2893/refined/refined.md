Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper nonce validation within the `process_deactivate_product` function of the WP EasyCart plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of nonce validation makes the `process_deactivate_product` function susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can deactivate products on the vulnerable site by tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing a similar action. This could lead to disruption of services, loss of revenue for the site owner, and a negative impact on user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through a forged request.
- The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link) that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to deliver a crafted URL or request that will be executed by an authenticated administrator.
