Based on the provided information, this content describes a bug in GitLab related to user privileges and OIDC authentication, and **does not** relate to a CVE.

The bug described is:
- **Root cause:** A regression introduced in merge request !111904 related to supporting admin/external/required groups for OIDC authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core issue is that after upgrading to GitLab version 15.10.0, some administrator accounts are demoted to regular user accounts. This is happening when OIDC is used for authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Administrators lose their privileges, preventing them from managing the GitLab instance. This requires manual intervention by other administrators to restore privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** There's no indication of a direct attack vector in the document. This is a bug triggered during normal operation when OIDC is enabled and an upgrade to version 15.10.0 occurs. The problem is triggered by a user logging in and out of the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  This bug doesn't involve a malicious actor. The problem arises when a user (particularly the `root` user) logs in and out of a GitLab instance after upgrading to 15.10.0 with OIDC authentication enabled.

Therefore, the correct response is:
**UNRELATED**
