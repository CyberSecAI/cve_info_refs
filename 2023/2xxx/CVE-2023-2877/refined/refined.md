- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization and validation of the plugin URL when installing add-ons. Specifically, it does not verify if the user is allowed to install plugins, and does not validate the source of the plugin being installed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect Authorization: Users with low-level roles like "Subscriber" can install and activate arbitrary plugins.
    - Insufficient Input Validation: The plugin does not properly validate the URL of the plugin being installed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by installing and activating a malicious plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to the `/wp-json/frm-admin/v1/install-addon` endpoint, combined with crafted JavaScript in the browser's console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with a minimum role of "Subscriber".
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin interface.
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in their browser's console while accessing the admin interface.
