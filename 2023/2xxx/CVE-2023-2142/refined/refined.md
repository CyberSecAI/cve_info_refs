Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2142

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a bypass in the autoescape functionality of the Nunjucks template engine. Specifically, when two user-controlled parameters are present on the same line within a template, it becomes possible to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input sanitization or escaping.
- Failure to correctly handle user-controlled parameters when used in close proximity.
- Inadequate protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Modifying displayed content.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates user-controlled parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to influence or control two parameters being used in the same line within a Nunjucks template.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when user-controlled parameters are used in views, such as in a Javascript context within HTML.
- The backslash character `\` can be used to escape the expected context and inject the XSS payload.
- Example: An attacker can use a URL like `https://<application-url>/?lang=jp\&place=};alert(document.domain)//` to inject malicious Javascript.

**Affected Versions:**
- Nunjucks versions prior to 3.2.4

**Patched Versions:**
- Nunjucks version 3.2.4
