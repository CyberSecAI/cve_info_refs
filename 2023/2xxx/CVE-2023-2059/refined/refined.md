Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `select_templets.php` file of DedeCMS v5.7.87. The `$activepath` parameter, which is used to determine the directory to be listed, is controllable by the user and susceptible to directory traversal attacks due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `$activepath` parameter, allowing attackers to inject directory traversal sequences.
- **Regular Expression Bypass:** A regular expression intended to prevent directory traversal is easily bypassed. The use of `\` (backslash) allows bypassing filters aimed at preventing `../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can access arbitrary files and directories on the server. This could potentially lead to:
    - Reading sensitive files (configuration files, databases, etc.)
    - Modifying files and thus leading to arbitrary code execution
    - Leaking data
    - Potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious request to `select_templets.php` by manipulating the `activepath` parameter and inserting directory traversal sequences such as `..\`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the value of the `activepath` parameter. No authentication may be needed for successful exploitation, according to the description.
