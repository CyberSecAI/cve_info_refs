The provided content relates to CVE-2023-2181.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a user with the `Developer` role to push a replacement reference in the `refs/replace` namespace. This allows them to replace an existing commit with a malicious one, without this being reflected in the Merge Request (MR) UI. When this replaced commit is merged into the protected branch, it bypasses the intended branch protection and introduces the malicious content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `refs/replace` namespace is not properly handled in the context of Merge Requests.
- Gitlab doesn't validate if the content of the merged commit is the same as the displayed commit in the MR.
- Insufficient validation of commit content when merging, allowing a commit replacement to go unnoticed during MR review.
- A `Developer` role has the ability to manipulate commits in a way that undermines branch protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious code injection into protected branches.
- Bypassing branch protection mechanisms.
- Potential for sensitive data leaks, unauthorized resource access, or even complete system compromise.
- Code integrity is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with `Developer` access to a repository pushes a replacement reference in the `refs/replace` namespace.
- The attacker creates a branch with a malicious commit, a secondary branch with legitimate content that will be replaced and creates a MR.
- The malicious commit replaces a legitimate commit in the MR head, thus after the MR is merged the main branch receives the replaced commit instead of the commit that was shown in the MR.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a GitLab account with `Developer` role permissions in the target repository.
- The attacker needs the ability to clone the repository and push changes.
