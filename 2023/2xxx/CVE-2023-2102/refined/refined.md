Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a vulnerability related to user display name escaping in the backend section of the EasyAppointments application.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The user display name was not properly escaped before being displayed in the backend header. This could lead to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of output escaping of the user display name. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the display name, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the backend.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of attacks including session hijacking, defacement, redirecting to malicious sites, and other malicious actions within the context of the targeted user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would be through a malicious user crafting a specially crafted display name with embedded JavaScript. This display name would be stored in the system, and when rendered, the embedded script would execute in a victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to modify their display name within the system.  Depending on the application's user management capabilities, this might require a privileged account.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in the commit `bddc5cbeb7ff237a72943b304dcb01c653781767` by modifying the `application/views/components/backend_header.php` file.
- The change was from `<?= vars('user_display_name') ?>` to `<?= e(vars('user_display_name')) ?>`.
- The `e()` function is likely used for escaping the user display name HTML output, preventing XSS.

This commit provides a fix for an XSS vulnerability.
