## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Stop Spammers Security < 2023 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the payload below in any of the "Challenge & Block" (ie /wp-admin/admin.php?page=ss\_challenge) settings, or in the "Response Timeout Value" settings in the "Protection Options" (ie /wp-admin/admin.php?page=ss\_options) and save
" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
