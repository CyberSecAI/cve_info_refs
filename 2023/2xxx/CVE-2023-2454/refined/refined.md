Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the two CVEs:

**CVE-2023-2454**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability stems from how `CREATE SCHEMA ... schema_element` interacts with protective `search_path` changes. This allows an attacker with database-level `CREATE` privilege to execute arbitrary code as the bootstrap superuser.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The vulnerability lies in the insufficient protection against altered `search_path` settings when creating schemas using the `CREATE SCHEMA ... schema_element` command.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges, potentially compromising the entire database system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a network-based attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have database-level `CREATE` privilege, which is often granted to database owners and can be extended to other users via explicit grants. They must be able to send malicious commands through the network connection.

**CVE-2023-2455**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in a missed scenario involving function inlining within the row security policy mechanism. Specifically, the row security policies do not consider changes in the user ID when inlining is used. This was missed in the fix for CVE-2016-2193
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Row security policies disregard user ID changes after inlining. This can cause a query that is planned under one role to be executed under other roles, applying potentially incorrect policies.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Exploitation can lead to users being able to read or modify data that they would otherwise be prohibited from accessing due to the row security policies in place. This could include sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a network-based attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute queries and use `SET ROLE` commands to switch between roles. The database must have row-level security policies defined using `CREATE POLICY` and role specific policies. Additionally, the attacker must have a way to trigger function inlining.

**Additional Notes**

*   Both CVEs affect PostgreSQL versions 11 through 15.
*   Fixes for both vulnerabilities were released in the following versions: 15.3, 14.8, 13.11, 12.15, and 11.20
*   NetApp products using vulnerable PostgreSQL versions are also affected by these CVEs.

**CVSS Scores**

*   CVE-2023-2454 has a CVSS score of 7.2 (High).
*   CVE-2023-2455 has a CVSS score of 5.4 (Medium).
