  "response": {
    "relates_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient encryption of the user data supplied during the abandoned cart link decode process. The encryption key was hardcoded in the plugin, allowing attackers to generate valid login links.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel",
      "Insufficient encryption",
      "Hardcoded encryption key"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can log in as users who have abandoned their carts, typically customers, and potentially gain access to administrative user accounts if they have abandoned a cart.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited via specially crafted URLs sent through email notifications."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to generate a valid authentication bypass link by knowing the hardcoded encryption key and the abandoned cart identifier of the target user."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found in Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin versions up to and including 5.15.1. The patch included backward compatibility in version 5.15.0, that was later removed in 5.15.1 to ensure proper mitigation. Further hardening was introduced in version 5.15.2 to prevent null key values from allowing the authentication bypass."
