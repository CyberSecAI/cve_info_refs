Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-2336:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Import from Server" functionality in the Pimcore asset management system. Specifically, it allowed non-admin users to import files from the server, which could potentially lead to arbitrary file read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper access control for the "Import from Server" feature. Non-admin users were able to trigger this functionality, which was intended for administrators only.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The ability to import from the server can be exploited to read arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file read**: An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server by exploiting the import functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- By using the "import from server" functionality in the Pimcore asset management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the Pimcore backend, but without admin rights.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit message "[Security] Admin Authenticated Arbitrary File Read" along with the code diffs directly addresses the vulnerability. The fix involves restricting the "importFromServer" functionality to admin users only.
- The commit modifies `AssetController.php` to ensure that only admins can use the `importServerFilesAction` and updates `tree.js` to hide the import from server function for non-admin users in the asset tree menu.
- The upgrade notes in `README.md` indicate that the "Import from Server" feature is now only available for admins and will be removed in a future Pimcore version, which implies a long-term plan to eliminate this functionality.
- The github commit message `[Security] Admin Authenticated Arbitrary File Read` also indicates the same vulnerability.
