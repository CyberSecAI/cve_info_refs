Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists in the module editing functionality of DedeCMS v5.7.87.
- Specifically, the issue arises from the way SQL statements are handled during the module uninstallation process.
- The system retrieves a custom SQL statement from a module's XML configuration file, decodes it from base64, and executes it during uninstallation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Injection:** The core weakness is that the system allows user-defined SQL statements, provided within the module XML's `delsql` field, to be executed directly during the uninstall process.
- **Lack of Sanitization/Validation:** There is no apparent sanitization or validation of the SQL statements before execution. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Base64 Decoding:** The vulnerability is made more accessible as the injected SQL is base64 encoded within the module xml.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can use the arbitrary SQL injection vulnerability to perform database operations that result in Remote Code Execution. This is achieved by injecting SQL statements that write PHP code to a file within the webserver's document root.
- **Full System Compromise:** By executing malicious SQL, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Module Uninstallation:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious module with a crafted `delsql` field in its XML configuration file. This malicious SQL can then be base64 encoded and placed within the module's XML configuration.
- **Module Upload:** The attacker must upload the malicious module to the target system.
- **Triggering Uninstallation:** The attacker then needs to trigger the uninstallation process of the malicious module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to DedeCMS backend:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to upload a module and trigger its uninstallation in the DedeCMS backend.
- **Knowledge of DedeCMS:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the DedeCMS module system, particularly the module's XML configuration and the use of `delsql` for module removal.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL statements to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including information on how the vulnerability is triggered using module editing features and the vulnerable `delsql` field.

**Summary**
The provided information outlines a command execution vulnerability in DedeCMS v5.7.87 where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL through a module's XML configuration which can result in remote code execution.
