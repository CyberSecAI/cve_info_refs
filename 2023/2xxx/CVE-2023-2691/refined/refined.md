The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and displaying it back to users. Specifically, the `item_name` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page. This can lead to various attacks, including:
   - Stealing cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
   - Defacing the web page.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
   - The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `item_name` parameter of a POST request to `/PPES/admin/add_item.php`.
   - The payload is stored in the database.
   - When a user visits the `/PPES/admin/item.php` page, the stored payload is retrieved from the database and executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to `/PPES/admin/add_item.php` with the malicious payload.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated as admin since the vulnerability is in `/PPES/admin/add_item.php`
   - The attacker needs no special access to the system other than the ability to submit the request.
