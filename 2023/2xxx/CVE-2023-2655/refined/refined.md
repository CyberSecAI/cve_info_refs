- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. In this case, the proof of concept uses a `SLEEP()` function call, which would cause a time-based denial of service, or can be used to extract data, modify data, or execute arbitrary code on the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when editing a form and interacting with the "MySQL Mapping" feature. Specifically, by manipulating the `id` or `form_id` parameters in the HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin privileges to edit a form within the WordPress plugin.
