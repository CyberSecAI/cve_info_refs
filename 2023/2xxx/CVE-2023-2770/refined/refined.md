The provided content describes a SQL Injection vulnerability found in the `/ci_exam/kelasdosen/data` endpoint.

- **Root cause:** The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input in the `columns[1][data]` parameter within a POST request. Specifically, the `nip` field is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The application fails to sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By injecting SQL queries, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server. In the provided example, the attacker uses `SLEEP(12)` which can be used for timing-based attacks, but they could inject any valid SQL.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a POST request to the `/ci_exam/kelasdosen/data` endpoint with a crafted `columns[1][data]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The provided example shows that the endpoint does not require authentication.
