{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not escape a parameter before outputting it back in an attribute.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript in the context of a logged-in admin user's session, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL with a malicious payload in the 'code' parameter of the plugin's admin page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to click on the crafted link. No other special privileges are needed beyond tricking the user into accessing the malicious link while logged in."
