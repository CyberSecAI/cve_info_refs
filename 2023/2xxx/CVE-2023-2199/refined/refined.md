{
  "ID": "CVE-2023-2199",
  "Description": "A regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the FrontMatterFilter of GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 13.0 before 15.10.4, 15.11 before 15.11.2, and 16.0 before 16.0.1. An attacker can send a crafted payload to the `preview_markdown` endpoint, causing a denial of service.",
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a vulnerable regular expression in `Gitlab::FrontMatter::PATTERN` that is used to parse front matter in Markdown fields. When this regular expression is used on a specially crafted input string, it causes severe backtracking, leading to excessive CPU consumption.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
  ],
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a crafted payload. This DoS can severely impact the availability of the entire GitLab instance, causing it to become unresponsive and return 500 errors for all requests including authenticated ones and API requests. This also impacts the behavior of other components relying on the GitLab instance.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a crafted JSON payload to the `preview_markdown` endpoint of a GitLab instance.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to know the URL of a public group in the targeted GitLab instance and its `csrf-token` and `_gitlab_session` values."
