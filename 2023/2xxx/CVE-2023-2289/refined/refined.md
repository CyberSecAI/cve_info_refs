Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'wp-vertical-image-slider' WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `search_term` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the website via the `search_term` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user clicks on a crafted link or performs a specific action, the injected script can execute within the user's browser.
- This could allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `search_term` parameter in the plugin's functionality.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript within the `search_term` parameter.
- The attacker then tricks a victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to have any prior access or privileges to the WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the 'wp-vertical-image-slider' plugin up to and including 1.2.16.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.17 by implementing proper sanitization of the `search_term` parameter using `sanitize_text_field()` and output escaping using `esc_html()`.
- Other parameters like `action`, `order_by`, and `order_pos` were also vulnerable and were fixed using `sanitize_text_field()` and `esc_html()`.
- The fix also included sanitization of data from POST requests (`imagetitle` and `imageurl`) using `esc_html()` and `esc_url_raw()` along with some additional sanitization of SQL parameters.
