- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `fullname`, `contact`, and `message` fields of the contact form before saving it into the database and displaying it to other users.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application attempts to sanitize the input using `htmlspecialchars` after escaping for SQL, but this is insufficient as `htmlspecialchars` does not neutralize HTML tags which are needed for XSS.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the contact form fields. When an administrator views the inquiry, the injected script will execute in their browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting the admin to a malicious site.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the contact form located at `/php-lfis/?page=contact`. An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript and includes it in the `fullname`, `contact` or `message` fields.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form and submit data. There are no special privileges or positions required.
