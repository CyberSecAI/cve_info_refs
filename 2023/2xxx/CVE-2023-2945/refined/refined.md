{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication and authorization checks in the handling of patient portal messages. The code does not consistently verify if the sender of a message matches the currently logged-in user, identified by the `portal_username` session variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
      "Insufficient Authentication",
      "Insufficient Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially send messages on behalf of other patients by manipulating the `sender_id` and `sender_name` parameters in a POST request. This allows an attacker to impersonate other users, potentially leading to privacy breaches, misinformation, and unauthorized communication.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector_details": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted POST requests to the `handle_note.php` endpoint. The attacker needs to be logged into the patient portal, and they can then modify the `sender_id` and `sender_name` parameters in the request.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid account on the patient portal. Additionally, they need the knowledge of other patients' IDs or at least the capability to craft requests to make the server to perform the lookups (e.g. via SQL injection, not covered in this CVE details)"
    },
      "fix": "The commit `3656bc88288957d68ba040cad2e5f9dbd1b607b1` implements the following checks: \n\n*   It verifies that if `sender_id` is provided, it matches the `portal_username` from the session.\n*   It verifies that if `sender_name` is provided, it matches the full name of the patient associated with the `pid` in the session. The commit ensures that any attempt to alter these parameters results in the destruction of the portal session and termination of the script."
