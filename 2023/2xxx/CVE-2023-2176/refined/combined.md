* *Subject*: [PATCH rdma-next] RDMA/core: Fix resolve\_prepare\_src error cleanup
* *From*: Leon Romanovsky <leon@xxxxxxxxxx>

```
From: Patrisious Haddad <phaddad@xxxxxxxxxx>

resolve_prepare_src() changes the destination address of the id,
regardless of success, and on failure zeroes it out.

Instead on function failure keep the original destination address
of the id.

Since the id could have been already added to the cm id tree and
zeroing its destination address, could result in a key mismatch or
multiple ids having the same key(zero) in the tree which could lead to:
