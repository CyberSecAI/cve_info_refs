## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Buy Me a Coffee < 3.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Multiple admin settings are vulnerable to XSS:
First:
- Enable Widget and select Customize widget
- At the description or Widget message parameters add: `"autofocus onfocus=alert(1)//`
- Save and navigate back to "Customize Widget" and XSS will be shown.
Second:
- In the plugin settings, select "Customize Button".
- Intercept the request and add the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` to the `text` parameter.
- The XSS will then be saved in the database, bypassing the `maxlength` check on the field.
