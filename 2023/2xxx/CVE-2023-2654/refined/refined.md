Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Conditional Menus" fails to properly sanitize a parameter named `selected` before outputting it within an HTML attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into a request and then reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying website content or data.
    *  Compromise administrative accounts if an admin is targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires a logged-in user, ideally an administrator, to visit a page containing the malicious HTML. The attacker would need to craft a specific HTML form that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The malicious HTML contains a form with a hidden input field. The `selected` parameter in the form has an XSS payload as its value. When the form is automatically submitted via JavaScript's onload event, the payload is sent to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user, preferably an administrator, into visiting a page containing the malicious HTML code. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by injecting the malicious code into another website that the victim is likely to visit.
*   The attacker does not need any direct access to the target server or WordPress installation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=themify_cm_get_conditions`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `selected`, which is sent via a POST request.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.1
