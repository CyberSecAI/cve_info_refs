- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `order_by` parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires a logged-in administrator to visit a crafted URL. This can be achieved by:
    - Social engineering the administrator into clicking on a malicious link.
    - Embedding the malicious URL into a website the administrator is likely to visit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the injected XSS payload and trick a logged-in administrator into opening that URL.
