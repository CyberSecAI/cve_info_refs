Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/eval/ajax.php` file, specifically within the `delete_class` action. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. By crafting a malicious `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, which is the `id` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
*   **Direct Query Construction:** The vulnerable code appears to be constructing the SQL query using string concatenation, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:**  The provided example payload `id=1 and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` demonstrates the ability to extract the database name.
*   **Arbitrary Data Access/Modification:**  A successful attack could allow the attacker to access, modify, or delete data within the `evaluation_db` database.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user privileges and application logic, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges and gain further control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/eval/ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter, passed as a form-encoded value, is the injection point.
*   **SQL Injection Payload:**  Malicious SQL code, such as the `updatexml` based payload, is inserted into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with appropriate parameters and content types.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Some SQL knowledge is required to craft the injection payload.
*   **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable endpoint. In this case, the attacker is using the referer header.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is "Faculty Evaluation System v1.0 by oretnom23".
*   The database name is `evaluation_db`.
*   The provided steps demonstrate how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability and retrieve information from the database.
