- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied parameters before outputting them within HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions with the privileges of the victim user if they are logged in.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within a parameter. The victim, particularly a high-privilege user such as an admin, is tricked into opening the crafted URL through social engineering. The XSS payload is then triggered when the user interacts with the page (e.g. using accesskey shortcuts).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user, particularly an administrator, into visiting a maliciously crafted URL. The user must be logged in, and then activate the injected script using a specific keyboard shortcut.
