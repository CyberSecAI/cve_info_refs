Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2839:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5411-1) lists CVE-2023-2839 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the gpac package update. The associated GitHub commit fixes an issue related to frame rate calculation, corroborating that this CVE is about a bug within GPAC.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of frame rate within the `naludmx_create_avc_decoder_config` function of the GPAC multimedia framework. Specifically, the code calculates `ctx->cur_fps.num` and `ctx->cur_fps.den` based on values from the Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) and the `pic_struct` field from the Picture Timing Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message. A fix was introduced to handle cases where `ctx->notime` is true.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of frame rate calculation logic when the `notime` flag is set.  An incorrect `DeltaTfiDivisorIdx` can be computed, and the subsequent calculations of `ctx->cur_fps.num` and `ctx->cur_fps.den` use this potentially invalid value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   The incorrect frame rate calculation could lead to issues in video playback, potentially causing incorrect timing, frame skipping, or other display anomalies.
- The Debian Security Advisory mentions that multiple issues in GPAC could result in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code. While this specific fix appears to resolve an incorrect calculation, the advisory implies that other vulnerabilities in the listed CVEs could have more severe impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves crafting a specially designed video file (e.g. AVC stream) that manipulates the SPS and SEI timing information. When processed by the vulnerable version of GPAC, this triggers the incorrect frame rate calculation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need the ability to provide a specially crafted media file to be processed by a vulnerable application or system using GPAC. The attacker would need knowledge of the AVC/H.264 bitstream format to manipulate timing parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub commit (047f96fb39e6bf70cb9f344093f5886e51dce0ac) shows the code changes that fix the issue within `src/filters/reframe_nalu.c`.
- The fix involves an additional check to calculate the fps, and handle cases where `ctx->notime` is set.
- The commit message references issue [#2476](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/2476) which may provide more context on the reported problem.
