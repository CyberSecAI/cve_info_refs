Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-2989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability within the Globalscape EFT administration server when processing compressed messages. This occurs because the server does not properly validate the length field within a compressed message after decompression. The parser uses the provided length value, even if it's maliciously crafted to be extremely large, leading to the parser reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Memory Read:** The primary weakness is the ability to force the server to read memory outside of the intended buffer due to lack of proper length validation after decompression.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server fails to validate the length field of the decompressed data, which allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary length.
*   **Insecure Handling of Compressed Messages:** The server processes compressed messages differently than uncompressed messages; specifically, the message length field is not validated after decompression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By crafting a specific message, an attacker can cause the server's parser to jump into a recently logged-in administrator's login message, effectively bypassing authentication. This allows the attacker to gain access to the administrative interface.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Since the administrative interface allows for the execution of Windows commands in the context of the service user (typically `SYSTEM`), a successful authentication bypass leads directly to remote code execution as `SYSTEM`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending malicious messages to the Globalscape EFT administration port (default TCP port 1100).
*   **Compressed Messages:** The exploit leverages the use of specially crafted, compressed messages to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Globalscape EFT server.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to time their exploit attempt shortly after an administrator logs in.
*   **Heap Manipulation (to a degree):** The attacker needs to send an exploit message at a specific time and offset to land in the login message in the heap memory space of an administrator user.
*  **Understanding of the protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the protocol of the administration port to craft messages with malicious lengths that will trigger the memory out of bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Fortra Globalscape 8.0.x up to 8.1.0.14.
* It was fixed in version 8.1.0.16.
* The exploit relies on a heap overflow, so successful exploitation is not always guaranteed but can be improved upon with additional heap massaging.
* The vendor has published an advisory for this vulnerability [here](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11586/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Authentication-Bypass-via-Outofbounds-Memory-Read-vulnerability).
