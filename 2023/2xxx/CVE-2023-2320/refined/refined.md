- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugins do not properly sanitize a parameter before outputting it back into an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL. This could lead to actions being performed on behalf of the victim or potentially stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL that contains malicious JavaScript within the `code` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin user to open a malicious URL.
