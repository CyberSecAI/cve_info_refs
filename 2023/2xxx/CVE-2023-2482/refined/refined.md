- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, specifically the `updateorder` and `deletebreakpoints` parameters, while logged in as an administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in with high-privilege user role such as an administrator.
