  "CVE-2023-2856": {
    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Wireshark's `parse_vms_packet` function. This vulnerability is triggered during a READ operation leading to a signal abort (SIGABRT), and could allow an attacker to crash the application leading to a denial of service. Depending on how the application is used, it could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, but this would require further investigation.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a stack buffer overflow in the `parse_vms_packet` function, specifically while reading a 'line' char array.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application. There is also a potential, though unconfirmed, for arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed VMS TCPIPtrace file. An attacker can exploit this by injecting a malformed packet or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malformed VMS TCPIPtrace file to Wireshark. This could involve injecting a crafted packet on the network or providing a malicious capture file.",
      "Affected versions": "4.0.0 to 4.0.5, 3.6.0 to 3.6.13",
      "Fixed versions": "4.0.6, 3.6.14"
  }
