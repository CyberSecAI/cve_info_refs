- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate the `file` parameter when importing CSV files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `file` parameter in the CSV import functionality. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, system files, or database credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/edit.php` endpoint with a malicious `file` parameter in the URL, the attacker can trigger the LFI vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality.
