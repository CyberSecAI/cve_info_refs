Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `id` parameter in the `/eval/index.php?page=edit_user` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically a UNION-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted GET request to the `/eval/index.php?page=edit_user` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not appear to need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/eval/index.php?page=edit_user&id=`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Payload Example:** `/eval/index.php?page=edit_user&id=-1%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6,7--+`
*   **Database Name:** `evaluation_db`
