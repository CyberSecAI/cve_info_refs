- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `Foxboro.sys` driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-787: Out-of-Bounds Write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor with local user access can craft a script/program using an IOCTL call in the `Foxboro.sys` driver, leading to local denial-of-service, elevation of privilege, and potentially kernel execution. This could result in loss of system functionality or unauthorized access to system functions.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access with crafted script/program using an IOCTL call to the `Foxboro.sys` driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
