Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-1d526d551c
2023-06-30 01:34:31.054467
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : bind-dyndb-ldap
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 11.10
Release : 15.fc37
URL : <https://releases.pagure.org/bind-dyndb-ldap>
Summary : LDAP back-end plug-in for BIND
Description :
This package provides an LDAP back-end plug-in for BIND. It features
support for dynamic updates and internal caching, to lift the load
off of your LDAP server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

# Update to BIND 9.18.16 Selected parts from [upstream release notes](https://d
ownloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.16/doc/arm/html/notes.html#notes-for-
bind-9-18-16). Visit that for details of bug fixes. ## Security Fixes - The
overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the cache from
significantly exceeding the configured max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)
ISC would like to thank Shoham Danino from Reichman University, Anat Bremler-
Barr from Tel-Aviv University, Yehuda Afek from Tel-Aviv University, and Yuval
Shavitt from Tel-Aviv University for bringing this vulnerability to our
attention. [GL #4055] - A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup
triggers a fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is aborted for
exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for named to enter an infinite
callback loop and crash due to stack overflow. This has been fixed.
(CVE-2023-2911) [GL #4089] ## New Features - The system test suite can now
be executed with pytest (along with pytest-xdist for parallel execution). [GL
#3978] ## Removed Features - TKEY mode 2 (Diffie-Hellman Exchanged Keying)
is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. A warning will be
logged when the tkey-dhkey option is used in named.conf. [GL #3905]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: ISC has disclosed two vulnerabilities in BIND 9 (CVE-2023-2828,
 CVE-2023-2911)

On 21 June 2023 we (Internet Systems Consortium) disclosed two vulnerabilities affecting our BIND 9 software:

- CVE-2023-2828:        named's configured cache size limit can be significantly exceeded <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-2828>
- CVE-2023-2911:        Exceeding the recursive-clients quota may cause named to terminate unexpectedly when stale-answer-client-timeout is set to 0 <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-2911>

New versions of BIND 9 are available from <https://www.isc.org/downloads>

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory of each published release directory:

- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.42/patches/>
- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.16/patches/>
- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.19.14/patches/>

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo period is ended and any updated software packages that have been prepared may be released.

Best regards,
Michał Kępień

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-8e1ddb1fa2
2023-06-25 00:49:42.634050
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : bind-dyndb-ldap
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 11.10
Release : 17.fc38
URL : <https://releases.pagure.org/bind-dyndb-ldap>
Summary : LDAP back-end plug-in for BIND
Description :
This package provides an LDAP back-end plug-in for BIND. It features
support for dynamic updates and internal caching, to lift the load
off of your LDAP server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

# Update to BIND 9.18.16 Selected parts from [upstream release notes](https://d
ownloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.16/doc/arm/html/notes.html#notes-for-
bind-9-18-16). Visit that for details of bug fixes. ## Security Fixes - The
overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the cache from
significantly exceeding the configured max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)
ISC would like to thank Shoham Danino from Reichman University, Anat Bremler-
Barr from Tel-Aviv University, Yehuda Afek from Tel-Aviv University, and Yuval
Shavitt from Tel-Aviv University for bringing this vulnerability to our
attention. [GL #4055] - A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup
triggers a fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is aborted for
exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for named to enter an infinite
callback loop and crash due to stack overflow. This has been fixed.
(CVE-2023-2911) [GL #4089] ## New Features - The system test suite can now
be executed with pytest (along with pytest-xdist for parallel execution). [GL
#3978] ## Removed Features - TKEY mode 2 (Diffie-Hellman Exchanged Keying)
is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. A warning will be
logged when the tkey-dhkey option is used in named.conf. [GL #3905]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
