The "Buy Me a Coffee â€“ Button and Widget Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on the recieve_post, bmc_disconnect, name_post, and widget_post functions in versions up to, and including, 3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as subscribers, to update the plugins settings. CVE-2023-25030 may be a duplicate of this issue.
