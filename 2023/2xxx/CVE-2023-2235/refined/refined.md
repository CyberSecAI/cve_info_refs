{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of perf events in versions 5.13 up to 6.3-rc2. Specifically, the issue arises when events are detached from a group after having been removed from their context using list_del_event().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of perf event detachment from groups after prior removal from context."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with low privileges is required."
