The provided content is related to CVE-2023-2583.

Based on the commit message and the changes in `packages/jsreport-core/README.md` and `packages/jsreport-core/package.json`, it appears that this commit addresses a security issue related to the `unset-value` and `vm2` dependencies.

Specifically:
- The `unset-value` dependency was updated from version `1.0.0` to `2.0.1`.
- The commit also mentions an update to `vm2` to fix a security issue.

The commit message for jsreport-core also mentions "update unset-value to fix security issue". This indicates that there was a known security vulnerability in the previous version of `unset-value`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a vulnerability in the `unset-value` package which is a dependency of `jsreport-core`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Vulnerability in `unset-value` package, possibly leading to unintended behavior when unsetting object properties. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the commit.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The exact impact of exploiting this vulnerability in `unset-value` is not described, but it was serious enough to require an update. It is likely related to incorrect or insecure handling of object properties, which may result in unauthorized access or modification of data or other unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would be related to how `jsreport-core` uses `unset-value`. Since the library is used to unset properties on an object, it is highly likely that a malicious actor may be able to leverage this to cause unexpected behavior on the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would likely need to be able to control or influence the input data or parameters to jsreport to trigger the vulnerability in `unset-value`. Further analysis of how `unset-value` is used within `jsreport-core` is needed to fully understand the attacker capabilities.

This commit updates the `jsreport-core` package to version 3.11.4 which includes the fix for the `unset-value` and `vm2` vulnerabilities.
