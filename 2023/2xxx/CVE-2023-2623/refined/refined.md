Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not properly restrict access to user data, allowing low-privilege users to retrieve sensitive information.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Sensitive Data Disclosure: The plugin returns all user data, including hashed passwords and email addresses, to low-privilege users.
- Insufficient Access Control: The plugin fails to restrict the information returned in a response.

Impact of exploitation:
- Disclosure of sensitive information, including email addresses and hashed passwords of all users, including administrators.
- Potential for unauthorized access to user accounts by cracking the leaked password hashes.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=ajax_post&route_name=resend_credential&id=1` parameters while being logged in as a low-privilege user (e.g., subscriber).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Must have a user account with the subscriber role or higher on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- Ability to send POST requests to the WordPress site's backend (e.g., using a web browser's developer console).
