Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) leading to Arbitrary User Email Change, Password Reset, and Privilege Escalation.

**Root Cause:** The `WCFMvm_Memberships_Registration_Controller` class's `processing()` method allows an unauthenticated attacker to specify a `member_id` parameter in a POST request. This `member_id` is then used in a call to `wp_update_user()` which also includes the email parameter from the request. This allows the attacker to change the email address associated with any user ID they choose.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the provided `member_id` from the POST request without proper authorization checks, allowing access to user objects based on user-controlled input.
*   **Arbitrary User Email Change:** Due to the lack of proper authorization, an attacker can change the email associated with any user.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By changing a user's email, an attacker can then initiate a password reset for the targeted user and gain access to their account. This can lead to complete account takeover if an administrator account is targeted.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to user accounts allows attackers to perform actions they are not authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a simple HTTP POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable `wcfm_membership_registration_form` data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Specific Position or Capabilities:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or access. They only need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the targeted WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess a valid user ID on the target system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `wc-multivendor-membership/tags/2.10.7/controllers/wcfmvm-controller-memberships-registration.php`, specifically around line 124, and how member_id and user_email are handled.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 2.10.7 of the "WCFM Membership â€“ WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace" plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.11.0.
