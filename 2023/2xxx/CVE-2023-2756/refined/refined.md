The provided content does not contain any information related to a specific CVE, but the commit message indicates a bug fix related to an "Inheritable Segment query" within the pimcore/customer-data-framework repository. 

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `inheritableSegments` function in `SegmentAssignmentController.php` handles queries for parent IDs related to segments. Specifically, the original query construction was susceptible to issues because it didn't properly use the database's quoting mechanism, which could potentially lead to SQL injection if the `type` parameter was maliciously crafted. This also resulted in an issue where the function would not return an empty data set when the `id` parameter was not set, which was also fixed in this commit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Potential SQL injection:** The code directly injected values into the SQL query string instead of using placeholders and proper quoting mechanisms. This could be exploited if an attacker could control the `type` parameter.
*   **Incorrect error handling:** The function didn't account for cases where the $id parameter was missing, which led to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data from the database or even modify data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request manipulation:** By manipulating the `type` parameter in an HTTP request to the `inheritableSegments` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker would need to have the ability to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint, usually within the context of the pimcore application (e.g., an admin user).
