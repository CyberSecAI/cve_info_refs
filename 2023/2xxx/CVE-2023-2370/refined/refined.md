The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `/odjms/admin/events/manage_event.php` file.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` GET parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker demonstrates the ability to perform a union query to retrieve data and a time-based blind injection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `id` GET parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication seems required to trigger the vulnerability.
