The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-2587.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the main page of the web interface of Teltonika's Remote Management System (RMS).
*   The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data before embedding it into a webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute scripts in the user's account context by sending a crafted JSON file containing HTML objects.
*   This can lead to remote code execution on managed devices.
*   The attacker can potentially gain complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to know the MAC address and serial number of a connected device.
*   They can then send a maliciously crafted JSON file through the Teltonika RMS.
*   When the vulnerable system renders the malicious content, the XSS payload is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the target device's MAC address and serial number.
*   They must be able to send data to the vulnerable RMS system.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. (UI:R)
