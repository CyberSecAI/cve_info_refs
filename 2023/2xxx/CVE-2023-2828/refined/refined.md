Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-2828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the cache-cleaning algorithm of the `named` daemon (BIND's DNS server). This algorithm is flawed, allowing the configured cache size limit to be significantly exceeded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Cache Management:** The core weakness is the improper handling of cache eviction, leading to uncontrolled growth beyond the intended limit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By exceeding the cache limits, the DNS server can become overloaded, unresponsive, or crash, preventing it from resolving DNS queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network by sending DNS queries that trigger the flawed cache-cleaning algorithm.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or authentication on the target system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the target DNS server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Shoham Danino, Anat Bremler-Barr, Yehuda Afek, and Yuval Shavitt.
- Patches for the vulnerability are available for various BIND versions: 9.16.42, 9.18.16, and 9.19.14
- The vulnerability is considered High severity with CVSS score of 7.5

In summary, CVE-2023-2828 is a significant vulnerability allowing a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service against a BIND DNS server by exploiting a flaw in its cache-cleaning mechanism.
