{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `save` function within the Essential Blocks plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can change plugin settings via a forged request. This is possible if an administrator clicks on a malicious link created by the attacker.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a forged HTTP request that targets the vulnerable `save` function. This request needs to be triggered by a logged-in administrator, typically through a malicious link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious web page. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to execute the forged request."
