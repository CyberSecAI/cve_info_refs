Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload mechanism in Weaver E-Office v9.5. Specifically, the `ajax.php` endpoint lacks proper validation of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files with arbitrary extensions and content due to missing file type checks or sanitization.
* **Insecure Filename Handling:** The provided proof-of-concept (POC) shows that the filename can be manipulated to include a PHP extension while appearing to have a different type due to a trailing "@" character (`1.php@`). This bypasses basic filename extension checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to `/E-mobile/App/Ajax/ajax.php?action=mobile_upload_save`.
* **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is uploaded as part of a multipart form data request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server running Weaver E-Office.
* **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL and parameters of the file upload endpoint.
* **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to construct a malicious HTTP POST request including the malicious file.
