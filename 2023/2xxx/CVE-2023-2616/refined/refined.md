The provided content is related to CVE-2023-2616. It describes a fix for a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the static routes panel of Pimcore.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in the static routes panel. Specifically, the fields `name`, `pattern`, `reverse`, `controller`, `variables`, `defaults`, `site_ids`, and `methods` were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization/encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. This code could be executed when an administrator views or interacts with the static routes panel, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the Pimcore backend could manipulate the vulnerable fields of a static route to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Pimcore backend with the ability to modify static routes.
- The attacker must be able to create/modify static routes and insert malicious JavaScript payload into the vulnerable fields.

**Technical details:**
- The fix introduces a new helper function, `htmlEncodeTextField` in `pimcore/helpers.js`, that HTML-encodes the values of text fields before they are saved. This function is applied to the vulnerable fields in the static routes panel.
- A new method `convertHtmlSpecialChars` was added to `SecurityHelper.php` to sanitize input by converting special HTML characters.
- The `convertHtmlSpecialChars` method in `SecurityHelper.php` is used to sanitize the `name`, `pattern`, `controller`, `variables`, `defaults`, and `reverse` properties of `Staticroute` model during set operation.
- The `setMethods` method in `Staticroute.php` iterates through provided methods and sanitizes them using `convertHtmlSpecialChars`.
- The `deleteConfirm` message box was also modified to use `htmlEncode` on the name.
