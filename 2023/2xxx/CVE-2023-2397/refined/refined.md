{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new field, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the 'name' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the 'name' parameter of a form submitted via HTTP POST to `/mcw/classes/Master.php?f=save_field`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel (requiring default credentials admin/admin123) and the ability to create new fields. The attacker also needs to be able to get the victim to visit the page displaying the stored XSS payload."
