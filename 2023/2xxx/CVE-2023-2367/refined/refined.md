Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) present in the "Faculty Evaluation System v1.0" by oretnom23.
- The vulnerability lies in the `/eval/admin/manage_academic.php` file, specifically in the handling of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the `id` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract database information using `updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)`. This allows the attacker to determine the database name.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** It's likely that other forms of SQL injection can be performed, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database. This could include:
    - Extracting sensitive information, such as user credentials.
    - Modifying application logic and functionality.
    - Escalating privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL:
   - Example URL: `/eval/admin/manage_academic.php?id=3%20and%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20database()),0x7e),0)--+`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQLi:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft suitable payloads.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content gives a specific vulnerable endpoint `/eval/admin/manage_academic.php?id=` along with an example payload.
- The vulnerability was found in "Faculty Evaluation System v1.0 by oretnom23" and the source code was downloaded from sourcecodester.
- The application is likely built using PHP and MySQL since the content mentions xmapp-php8.1 and the payload contains mysql specific functions.
- The content mentions the default admin credentials as `admin@admin.com/admin123`, but it is unclear if it's related to the vulnerability exploitation itself.
