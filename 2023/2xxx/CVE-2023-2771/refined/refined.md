The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `ci_exam/kelasdosen/data` endpoint, specifically within the `columns[1][data]` parameter, which is used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input into the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service. In this specific example the attacker uses a `SLEEP` function to demonstrate the vulnerability which is an indicator of a blind SQL injection vulnerability

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `ci_exam/kelasdosen/data` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific authentication details are mentioned in the content.
