Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2002:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-2002. It describes a vulnerability found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem, specifically related to insufficient permission checks on HCI sockets. The descriptions match the official CVE description.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** An insufficient permission check in the `hci_sock_ioctl` function allows tasks without the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to mark HCI sockets as trusted. This occurs because the check uses `capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)` which only checks the current task's capabilities and does not verify that the opener of the socket has the required capability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Capability Check:** The `capable()` check in `hci_sock_ioctl` is insufficient because it only verifies the capability of the current task and not the task that opened the socket.
    *   **Privilege Inheritance:** The vulnerability takes advantage of the fact that file descriptors, including sockets, can be inherited via fork/execve, allowing a privileged setuid program to unintentionally grant privileges to an unprivileged user.
    *   **Unclear Socket Trust:** The vulnerability exploits the HCI_SOCK_TRUSTED flag, which is set but never cleared, thereby granting persistent elevated privileges to the socket.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Management Command Execution:** An unprivileged user can gain a trusted socket, enabling them to send and receive management commands/events intended for privileged users.
    *   **Bluetooth Manipulation:** This can lead to actions such as pairing the controller with malicious devices, preventing legitimate pairing, and reading sensitive data, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communications.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation could result in a denial of service (loss of connection), due to the manipulation of the Bluetooth interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
    *  **Setuid Programs:** The attack relies on the presence of setuid programs (or programs with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) that invoke `ioctl` calls on standard input, standard output, or standard error file descriptors inherited from the parent process, as these are automatically assigned to newly opened HCI sockets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to be a local user, but does not need root or administrative access to initiate the attack.
    *  **Ability to Fork/Execve:** The attacker must be able to perform fork/execve operations to transfer the socket descriptor to a privileged program.

**3. Additional details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Linux kernel versions 4.9 and later are affected, specifically after commit `f81f5b2db869` was introduced.
*  **Exploitation Example:** The provided exploit code shows a simple example where an HCI socket is passed as stderr to a setuid program like `sudo`, which triggers an ioctl call that sets the `HCI_SOCK_TRUSTED` flag on that socket. The socket can then be used for unauthorized management commands.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The vulnerability can be fixed by replacing the `capable()` check with `sk_capable()`, which checks the capabilities of the socket opener, in addition to the current task.
    *   A second patch hardens the ioctl processing logic by adding a command validity check at the beginning of the `hci_sock_ioctl()` function and returning immediately with `ENOIOCTLCMD` if the command is invalid.
    *   As a workaround, disabling the Bluetooth device using `rfkill` can reduce the impact of this vulnerability if Bluetooth is not used.
*   **Similar Vulnerability:** The issue shares similar principles with CVE-2014-0181, which involved unauthorized Netlink operations via setuid programs.
*   **NetApp Products:** Some NetApp products use a vulnerable version of the Linux Kernel. NetApp has provided a mitigation plan for affected products which included patching and workarounds. The products affected are `NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S`, `NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C`, and `ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility`. Some products are still under investigation and most are listed as not affected.

**4. Content from different sources:**
The content provided consists of multiple different sources (netapp security advisories, openwall, github, debian and github docs). Combining the sources provides additional details about the vulnerability, the affected systems, how to fix it and how to exploit it, as well as how to search through github for code.

In summary, CVE-2023-2002 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem caused by an incorrect capability check within the `hci_sock_ioctl` function when handling ioctl calls on HCI sockets. This can lead to unauthorized execution of management commands by unprivileged users, allowing them to manipulate Bluetooth functionality and potentially compromising Bluetooth communication security. Exploitation requires a local attacker and depends on the existence of setuid programs or programs with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability that use `ioctl` calls on inherited file descriptors, which is common in most Linux distributions.
