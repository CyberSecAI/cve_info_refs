      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check on the `template_count` function within the Essential Blocks plugin. The function is intended to be used by administrative users, but it lacks proper authorization checks to enforce this. Additionally, the nonce check is skipped if a nonce is not provided by the request.",

        "Missing authorization check on the `template_count` function.",

    "additional_details": "The provided Wordfence content gives a more comprehensive explanation of the vulnerability compared to the CVE description. Specifically, it clarifies that the nonce check is present but bypassed when a nonce is not provided, and that there is a complete lack of capability checks on the affected `template_count` function."
