Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `search_term` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts.
- The injected scripts execute when a user is tricked into interacting with a malicious link (e.g. clicking on it).
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or unauthorized actions within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `search_term` parameter in a GET request.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload in the `search_term` parameter.
- They then trick a victim into visiting the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Photo Gallery Slideshow & Masonry Tiled Gallery plugin up to and including 1.0.13.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.14.
- CVE-2023-41658 is reported to be a duplicate of this issue
- The fix implemented involves using `esc_html` to sanitize the user-supplied input on multiple parameters, instead of `sanitize_text_field`, which is insufficient to prevent the XSS vulnerability.
