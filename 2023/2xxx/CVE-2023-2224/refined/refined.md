Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-2224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the "Seo By 10Web" WordPress plugin's settings. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately process input when adding URLs in the sitemap section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the plugin's settings, and when these settings are displayed, the injected code executes within the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser.
*   **Privilege Escalation/Account Takeover:** This could lead to various malicious actions, such as redirecting the user to a malicious website, stealing cookies or session tokens, or potentially performing actions on the website on behalf of the user if the user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Website Defacement:**  The attacker could modify the appearance of the website for other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Settings:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings, specifically the sitemap section where URLs can be added.
*   **Admin Access Required:** The attacker needs to have administrative access or a role with sufficient privileges to access and modify the plugin's settings page (specifically, the sitemap section). The content specifies "high privilege users such as admin" can perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Admin Privileges:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress dashboard with administrator-level privileges or a role with the ability to access and modify plugin settings.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability within the "Seo By 10Web" plugin.
*   **Ability to Input Malicious Payload:** The attacker must be able to navigate to the sitemap settings and add a URL containing the malicious XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information states that the vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.7 of the plugin.
*   The provided CVSS score is 3.4, indicating a low severity vulnerability.
*   The exploit involves inserting a crafted payload (e.g.,  `"><audio src=x onerror=confirm("XSS")>`) into the sitemap URL field.
