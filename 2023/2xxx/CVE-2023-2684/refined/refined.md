- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin's settings are vulnerable, specifically the `frou_filenaming_rules_opt[datetime_format]` setting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This code is then executed when a user views the affected settings page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script in a vulnerable settings field which when viewed in the admin panel is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges or other high-privilege access to modify plugin settings.
