Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-2545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `getListOfUsers` function within the Feather Login Page WordPress plugin. This function is intended to retrieve a list of temporary users created by the plugin, along with their associated login links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before executing the `getListOfUsers` function. This allows any authenticated user, even those with minimal privileges like "subscriber," to access the function and retrieve sensitive user data.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The `getListOfUsers` function reveals sensitive information about temporary users, such as their IDs, email addresses, first names, account expiry times, login codes, expiry dates, roles, registration date/time, and most critically, their temporary login links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can use the exposed temporary login links to bypass the regular authentication process and directly log in as the temporary user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By logging in using the temporary login links, attackers can gain access to accounts with higher privileges (e.g., administrator) if such accounts were created through the vulnerable plugin functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely via network access.
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user, but even a user with very low privileges is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- No special user role is required since the vulnerability is exploitable by any authenticated user including "subscriber".
- No special technical skills are required beyond being able to make a basic request to the vulnerable endpoint.
