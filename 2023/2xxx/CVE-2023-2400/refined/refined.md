Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper deletion of resources during user management in Devolutions Server. Specifically, when a user is deleted, their vault data is not properly removed, making it accessible through direct database access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Resource Deletion:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly delete or obfuscate user vault data when a user account is deleted.
*   **Direct Database Access:** The vulnerability allows an administrator with direct database access to potentially view the vault data of deleted users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with database access could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the vaults of deleted users (passwords, credentials, etc.).

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Direct Database Access:** An attacker needs administrative access to the database where Devolutions Server stores its data. This could be a rogue administrator or an attacker who has gained access to the database server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Administrator Privileges:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges in Devolutions Server or have direct access to the underlying database.
*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs direct access to the database where Devolutions Server stores its data.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is specific to Devolutions Server versions 2023.1.8 and earlier.
* The fix is available in version 2023.2.1 and higher.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.2 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
