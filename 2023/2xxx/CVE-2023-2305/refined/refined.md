Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wpdm_members`, `wpdm_login_form`, and `wpdm_reg_form` shortcodes.

**Weaknesses:**
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided attributes within the mentioned shortcodes.
- It does not properly escape output when rendering shortcode attributes on the page. This is evident in the provided code diffs where `echo $params['logo']` is changed to `echo esc_attr($params['logo'])`
- The affected files are `src/User/views/members.php`, `src/User/views/login-form.php`, and `src/User/views/reg-form.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the page where the vulnerable shortcode is used. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the shortcodes: `wpdm_members`, `wpdm_login_form`, and `wpdm_reg_form`.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the attributes of these shortcodes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions. This level of access allows the attacker to create or edit posts/pages where shortcodes can be added.
- No special network access or other uncommon privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.2.71 of the Download Manager plugin.
- The patch primarily involves the proper sanitization of input parameters using functions like `esc_attr` and `esc_html`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 3.2.70.
