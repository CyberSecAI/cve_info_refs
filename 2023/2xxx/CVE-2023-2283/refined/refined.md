{
  "CVE-2023-2283": {
    "description": "The `pki_verify_data_signature` function in libssh can accept invalid signatures when some memory allocations fail. This may happen if there is not enough memory or the memory usage is limited. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The return value `rc` is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible`. The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification, therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling",
        "Memory allocation failure leads to bypassed authentication."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based exploitation by an unauthenticated attacker."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to the vulnerable service or application, and ability to cause memory allocation issues."
