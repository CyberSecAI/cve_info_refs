The WPCS â€“ WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the anonymous function for the wpcs_sd_delete action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete an arbitrary custom drop-down currency switcher.
