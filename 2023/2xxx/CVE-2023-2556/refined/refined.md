Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2556

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `wpcs_sd_delete` action. Specifically, the anonymous function responsible for deleting custom drop-down currency switchers lacks a capability check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check before executing the delete operation, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the deletion of currency switchers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Deletion:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete any custom drop-down currency switcher configured within the plugin. This could disrupt the site's functionality related to currency switching and affect user experience.
- **Data Modification:**  While not a complete data loss, it results in modification of the site's settings by removing the configured currency switcher options.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `wp_ajax_wpcs_sd_delete` action.
- The attacker makes use of the AJAX functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Access to wp-admin:** The attacker would need to send a request to the WordPress admin-ajax.php file with the appropriate parameters.

**Technical Details from the Provided Content:**

- **Vulnerable Code:** The `classes/smart-designer.php` file contained the vulnerable code.
  - Before the fix, the `wp_ajax_wpcs_sd_delete` action used an anonymous function directly to delete currency switcher designs by ID from the database using `delete_option`. No capability check was in place before this action.
  - The fix adds `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )` to ensure that only users with the `manage_options` capability can trigger the delete action. It also adds a nonce check for the same action.
- **Affected Plugin:** WPCS â€“ WordPress Currency Switcher Professional
- **Affected Versions:** Versions up to and including 1.1.9.
- **Patched Version:** 1.2.0

**Additional Information:**

- The fix also updated other functions (create, save, get) within `classes/smart-designer.php` with nonce verification and capability checks using `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )`
- The changelog in `readme.txt` specifically mentions "security fix, thanks to Alex Thomas from Wordfence Security."
- The javascript files used for handling the actions were also updated with nonces using `wpcs_sd.nonce`.
