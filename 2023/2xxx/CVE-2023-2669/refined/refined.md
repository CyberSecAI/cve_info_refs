Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2669

**Vulnerable Software:** SourceCodester Lost and Found Information System

**Version:** 1.0

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` GET parameter before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` variable is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Availability:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the application, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `id` parameter in the URL's GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement to exploit this vulnerability in the provided content.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `/admin/?page=categories/view_category`.
- The vulnerable code snippet uses the following query:
```php
$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * from `category_list` where id = '{$_GET['id']}' ");
```
- The lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['id']` value allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Proof of Concept:**
1.  Visit the vulnerable page: `/php-lfis/admin/?page=categories/view_category&id=2`
2.  Use a tool like SQLmap to perform SQL injection testing.
3.  SQLmap successfully identifies the SQL injection vulnerability, reporting both boolean-based blind and time-based blind injection types. Example payloads used:
    -   `page=categories/manage_category&id=2' AND 9413=9413 AND 'OfUY'='OfUY`
    -   `page=categories/manage_category&id=2' AND (SELECT 1200 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))pTou) AND 'jydD'='jydD`
