Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3462-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : wordpress
Version        : 5.0.19+dfsg1-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-2745
Debian Bug     : 1036296

Several security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Wordpress, a
popular content management framework.

WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal via the ‚Äòwp_lang‚Äô
parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary
translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted
translation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also
used to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
5.0.19+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# WordPress 6.2.1 Maintenance & Security Release

---

## WordPress 6.2.1 is now available!

This minor release features [20 bug fixes in Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=6.2.1&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority) and [10 bug fixes for the block editor](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/88). You can review a summary of the maintenance updates in this release by reading the [Release Candidate announcement](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/09/wordpress-6-2-1-rc1-is-now-available/).

This release also features several security fixes. Because this is a security release, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately. All versions since WordPress 4.1 have also been updated.

WordPress 6.2.1 is a short-cycle release. The next major release will be [version 6.3](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-3/) planned for August 2023.

If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

You can [download WordPress 6.2.1 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.2.1.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù, and then click ‚ÄúUpdate Now‚Äù.

For more information on this release, please [visit the HelpHub site](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-6-2-1).

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities, and allowing them to be fixed in this release.

* Block themes parsing shortcodes in user generated data; thanks to Liam Gladdy of [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/) for reporting this issue
* A CSRF issue updating attachment thumbnails; reported by [John Blackbourn](https://johnblackbourn.com/) of the WordPress security team
* A flaw allowing XSS via open embed auto discovery; reported independently by Jakub ≈ªoczek of [Securitum](https://research.securitum.com/) and during a third party security audit
* Bypassing of KSES sanitization in block attributes for low privileged users; discovered during a third party security audit.
* A path traversal issue via translation files; reported independently by Ramuel Gall & Matt Rusnak at Wordfence, and during a third party security audit.

### Description

WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 6.2, via the ‚Äòwp\_lang‚Äô parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted translation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
