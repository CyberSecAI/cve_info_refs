- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the `videoUpload` function in `SystemAttachmentServices.php`, where the filename is constructed by concatenating `$data['filename']` and `$data['chunkNumber']` without proper sanitization. The `$data['chunkNumber']` is a client-controlled parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unrestricted file upload, specifically arbitrary file extension upload via manipulation of the chunk number parameter, leading to remote code execution.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary malicious code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is via the file upload functionality, specifically the video upload feature.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker must be logged into the backend of the application. The attacker also requires knowledge of how the chunked file upload mechanism is implemented to manipulate the file name parameter. They also require a packet capture tool to intercept and modify the parameters during the file upload.
