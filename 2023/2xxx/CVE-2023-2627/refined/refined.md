- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The KiviCare Management System plugin lacks proper CSRF and authorization checks in various AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Missing CSRF protection on AJAX actions.
    - Insufficient authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) to call sensitive AJAX actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized creation of Clinic Admins, Doctors, etc.
    - Arbitrary update of plugin settings (e.g., Recaptcha settings), leading to Stored XSS.
    - Update of terms and conditions message, leading to Stored XSS.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is exploited through AJAX requests made to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site (e.g., a subscriber).
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests, which can be done using the developer console in a web browser.
