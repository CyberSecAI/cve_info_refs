The provided content contains a commit from a GitHub repository, `liangliangyy/DjangoBlog`, that addresses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied content in comment sections. Specifically, the comment body was being escaped but then passed to a custom markdown function that rendered HTML without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized HTML rendering of user-provided comment content. The `custom_markdown` function was not properly sanitizing the rendered HTML, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within a comment. When other users view the comment, the script will execute in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the comment functionality. An attacker can submit a crafted comment body containing malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to submit comments on the blog.

**Details from Commit:**
The commit addresses the vulnerability by replacing the vulnerable `custom_markdown` function with `comment_markdown` which utilizes `sanitize_html` to clean the rendered markdown.
- `blog/templatetags/blog_tags.py`: The `comment_markdown` filter is modified to use `sanitize_html` after markdown rendering.
- `djangoblog/utils.py`: A `sanitize_html` function has been added which uses `bleach.clean` to sanitize HTML.
- `templates/comments/tags/comment_item.html` and `templates/comments/tags/comment_item_tree.html`: The `custom_markdown` filter was replaced with the new `comment_markdown` filter.
