- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `Custid` POST parameter before reflecting it in the HTML response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This code can then be executed in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Deface the web page
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the `Custid` parameter in a POST request to `/jewerly/customer.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific network position is required, but the attacker needs to identify the vulnerable endpoint.

The provided content gives a specific vulnerable file (`/jewerly/customer.php`) and the vulnerable POST parameter (`Custid`), along with example payloads and screenshots demonstrating the XSS. This information is more detailed than what is present in the usual CVE description.
