Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit message "fix: do not expose token in public runtime config":

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the unintentional exposure of the GitHub token within the public runtime configuration of the `nuxt/github-module`. This occurred because the module was directly assigning the token to `nuxt.options.runtimeConfig.public.github`, which is accessible to the client-side code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Exposure of sensitive information (GitHub token) in a public runtime configuration. This allows the token to be accessed by unauthorized users, as the public configuration is readily available in the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor who gains access to the exposed GitHub token could perform actions on the associated GitHub repository. This could involve reading sensitive data, making unauthorized changes, or potentially gaining access to the source code repository. The exposed token would grant the attacker the same level of access as the user who configured the token.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is client-side. The attacker would need to inspect the browser's network traffic or the page source to retrieve the public runtime configuration, which contains the exposed GitHub token.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special position or privileged network access, other than normal client side access to the web application. They would need to be able to view the public runtime config, which can be achieved by simply browsing the website using a standard web browser.

**Additional details:**
The fix commit `5490c43f729eee60f07920bf88c0aabdc1398b6e` changes the module configuration to:
  - Avoid setting the token directly in the public runtime config.
  - Set the token only in the private `nuxt.options.runtimeConfig.github` section, thus preventing client side access.
  - The commit message and diff explicitly highlight the issue and its fix.

This provides more detail than the usual CVE description.
