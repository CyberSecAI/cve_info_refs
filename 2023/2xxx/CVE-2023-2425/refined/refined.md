The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the 'name' parameter in the `/sis/classes/Master.php?f=save_course` endpoint when adding a new course. The application stores the unsanitized input in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization on the 'name' parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application via the course creation form. When a user visits the course list page (`/sis/admin/?page=courses`), the injected script is executed in their browser. This could lead to:
- Cookie theft
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Redirection to malicious sites
- Other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload, specifically a `<script>` tag containing Javascript, and submits it via the 'name' parameter in a POST request to `/sis/classes/Master.php?f=save_course`.
- The payload is stored in the database.
- When an authenticated user visits the course list page, the injected Javascript will execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the admin panel of the web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to create courses.
