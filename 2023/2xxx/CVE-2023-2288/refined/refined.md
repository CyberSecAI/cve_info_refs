- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-controlled file paths before performing file operations. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to use the `phar://` stream wrapper to trigger PHAR deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization via object injection. The vulnerability exists because the plugin uses a user-provided file path in a manner that allows the use of the `phar://` stream wrapper and PHP deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, by achieving arbitrary deserialization. The provided proof of concept shows the execution of `die('Arbitrary deserialization')` which confirms this.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a web request to the `/wp-json/otter/v1/dynamic` endpoint, using a crafted URL with a `phar://` stream wrapper to trigger the deserialization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with author privileges. They need to be able to upload files to the server. The server must also be running a PHP version prior to 8.0 for the `phar://` stream wrapper to be exploitable in this manner.
