Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the maintenance mode bypass feature in the CMP â€“ Coming Soon & Maintenance WordPress plugin. The plugin uses a GET parameter `cmp_bypass` in the URL to bypass maintenance mode. The value of this parameter, by default, is an MD5 hash of the site's home URL. This makes it easy for an attacker to calculate the correct bypass value and access the site even when maintenance mode is active.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Insecure Bypass Key Generation:** The use of a predictable, MD5-hashed home URL as the default bypass key is a major weakness. The home URL is public information, making the bypass key easily calculable.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly secure access control for the maintenance mode bypass functionality, allowing unauthorized users to access the site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Maintenance Mode Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the maintenance mode of the website, allowing them to view the site, access restricted content, or potentially conduct further attacks when the site is supposed to be under maintenance, development, or construction.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If the site is not fully prepared for public access, an attacker could gather information about site's content, configuration or infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the `cmp_bypass` parameter with the correct MD5 hash of the site's home URL, and then loads that URL in a browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Public Network Access:**  The attacker only needs access to the website's URL.
*   **Basic Cryptographic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to compute an MD5 hash.
*   **No Prior Access:** No prior account or access to the site's backend is needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 4.1.7 and earlier of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.1.8 by changing the default bypass ID from a md5 hash of home_url to a random string using `wp_rand()`.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Improper Access Control" with a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).

This detailed explanation goes beyond what is present in the official CVE description by providing information about the specific default bypass key used (MD5 of the home URL), and describing the attack vector in more detail.
