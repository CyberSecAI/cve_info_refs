0x01 Vulnerability description

```
There is an XSS(Cross Site Scripting) vulerability in the wordpress plugin called WP Directory Kit.
An attacker inserts malicious code into a web-page URL.
The code is triggered when user clicks the malicious links.

```

0x02 Recurrence of the vulnerability

```
This is tne main page of the plugin.

```

[![1.png](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/raw/main/images/WDK/0426-1.png)](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/blob/main/images/WDK/0426-1.png)

```
This is the page with the XSS vulnerability.
This XSS can be triggered by multiple payloads:"><img src/onerror=alert(1)> or "><svg/onload=alert(1)>
When you enter payload in the search box，an alert pop-up will appear.
So, there is an XSS vulnerability.

```

[![2.png](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/raw/main/images/WDK/0426-2.png)](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/blob/main/images/WDK/0426-2.png)

```
At this point a new field is added to the URL of the page:'&search=', malicious code is added after field.
And the affected web-page URL is: http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wdk_messages&search=

```

[![3.png](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/raw/main/images/WDK/0426-3.png)](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/blob/main/images/WDK/0426-3.png)

「EXP」

Purpose: By clicking on the malicious URL link constructed by the attacker and moving mouse, the user's page will load an image source.

```
Change the payload to: "><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>
We can see the user cookie information in the pop-up window.

```

[![4.png](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/raw/main/images/WDK/0426-7.png)](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/blob/main/images/WDK/0426-7.png)

```
Build an image server locally to load an image for the user.
The payload is "><img src/onerror=alert(1)>
Change the payload to "><img src=http://exploit.com/0426.png>.
merge the payload and URL to construct a malicious URL link.
When the user clicks on the malicious link, his page will load image resources.

```

[![5.png](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/raw/main/images/WDK/0426-8.png)](https://github.com/Don-H50/wp-vul/blob/main/images/WDK/0426-8.png)

### Description

The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'search' parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
