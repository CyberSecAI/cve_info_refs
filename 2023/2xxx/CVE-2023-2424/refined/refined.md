Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The content relates to a vulnerability in DEDECMS v5.7.106, but it does not provide a CVE ID.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `UpDateMemberModCache()` function in `uploads/dede/config.php` writes to a .inc file (`config_passport.php`), but the content is obtained from the database, which is user-controlled.
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `config.php` file does not include a global filter function to sanitize the data being written to the `.inc` file.
- This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the database which gets written to `config_passport.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unfiltered Data Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data before it is written to a file.
- **Insecure File Writing:** The function `UpDateMemberModCache` allows writing arbitrary content to a file, based on database entries controlled by the user, which can lead to malicious code injection.
- **Escaping single quotes:** The attacker uses a backslash to escape single quotes and then close it with a single quote and parentheses to close the existing code, allowing malicious code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code into the `member_model.inc` file, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to write arbitrary content to a file in a web-accessible directory allows for the injection of malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the webserver and potentially other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of DEDECMS, specifically through the member model management functionality where the user can add a new member template.
- **Database Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious code into the database through the membership model management functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into DEDECMS with sufficient privileges to access the member model management functionality and edit the related database records.
- **Knowledge of DEDECMS Functionality:** The attacker needs to understand how the `UpDateMemberModCache()` function is used and where the files are written to exploit this vulnerability.
- **File Inclusion:** The attacker needs to create a file in the file manager and include the malicious `.inc` file to trigger the injected code, allowing for execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves injecting PHP code into the database through member model management. This code will be written to the `member_model.inc` file by the `UpDateMemberModCache()` function.
- The attacker then creates a new php file using file manager, includes the `.inc` file, triggering the malicious code injection and leading to RCE.
- The attacker achieves command execution by leveraging a file include vulnerability.

In summary, this content describes a Remote Command Execution vulnerability in DEDECMS v5.7.106, caused by unfiltered data injection and insecure file writing within the member model management functionality.
