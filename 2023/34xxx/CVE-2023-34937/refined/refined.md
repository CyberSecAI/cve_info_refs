The provided content relates to CVE-2023-34937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `sscanf` without proper bounds checking when handling the `param` value in the `/goform/aspForm` route with `CMD=UpdateSnat`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Use of `sscanf` with `%s` format specifier without limiting the input length.
- Input parameter 'param' has a length limit of 511 bytes while destination buffer `v11` is only 64 bytes in size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the restart of the `webs` process, causing a denial of service. It is likely that with further exploitation, more severe impacts such as arbitrary code execution could be possible.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` route, with the `CMD` parameter set to `UpdateSnat` and the `param` parameter containing a string longer than 64 bytes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. The provided PoC shows this is achievable with network access to the device on IP 192.168.124.1
