Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Submission Web Form" of the Turnitin LTI tool/plugin version 1.3. Specifically, the `id` and `title` HTTP POST parameters are vulnerable to HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTML Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` and `title` parameters of the submission form. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the data submitted via the `id` parameter, which expects an integer, leading to a `NumberFormatException`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary HTML Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code that will be executed within the user's browser in the context of the affected site.
- **Malware Download/Sensitive Information Harvesting:** By inserting malicious links or scripts, an attacker can trick users into downloading malware or redirecting them to phishing sites to harvest sensitive information.
- **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker can manipulate the display of the submission form to trick users into clicking on malicious links.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/webapps/ip-turnitintool-.../student/submit` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The vulnerable parameters (`id` and `title`) are sent as part of a multipart form data request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the targeted system (e.g., a student account in a university environment) to be able to access the submission form.
- **Knowledge of User Data:** The attacker needs to know course id, content id, and other user-specific parameters to craft the malicious request.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a custom HTTP POST request with the malicious HTML code.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided malicious request demonstrates the injection of HTML code within the `id` and `title` parameters.
- The server-side code attempts to convert the `id` parameter to an integer, which fails due to the injected HTML, resulting in a `NumberFormatException`.
- The injected HTML is rendered in the "Submission Title" section, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The example injection includes an anchor tag with a malicious URL and additional HTML tags.
