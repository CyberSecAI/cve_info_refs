Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `angular-ui-notification` library is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not sanitize user-provided input before displaying it in notifications. Specifically, the `message` parameter within the notification function is not properly encoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The library directly renders user-provided strings as HTML without any form of encoding or escaping.
- Vulnerable parameter: The `message` parameter of the notification function is susceptible to XSS injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the notification message, which will then be executed within the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential for account compromise: This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions that compromise the user's account.
- Website defacement:  The attacker could potentially alter the appearance or functionality of the web application using the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User input: The vulnerability is triggered when unsanitized user-controlled input is passed to the `message` parameter of the `angular-ui-notification` library's notification functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to influence notification messages: The attacker must be able to control the content of the `message` parameter passed to the notification functions of `angular-ui-notification`. This might involve manipulating input fields, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or social engineering to convince a user to trigger the malicious notification.

**Additional details:**
- The provided text includes an example of how to exploit the vulnerability, showing that a simple `<script>alert(1)</script>` tag injected into the message would be sufficient to trigger an XSS attack.
- The exploit has been tested on multiple versions of the library (0.1.0, 0.2.0, and 0.3.6), indicating that the vulnerability exists across several versions.
- The library is stated as not actively maintained, meaning no patch is currently available. The suggested mitigation is to sanitize user input before passing it to the library. An example of sanitization using character code encoding is provided in the text.
