The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34612.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ph-json` library is vulnerable to a stack overflow error when parsing deeply nested JSON structures. This is due to the recursive nature of the parsing logic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability due to recursive parsing of nested JSON arrays/objects.
- Lack of depth limit during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by causing the parser to crash due to a stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious JSON string with excessive nesting and provide it as input to the vulnerable parser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the JSON input that is being processed by the vulnerable `ph-json` library.
- No specific privileges are required other than the ability to provide input to the parser.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by PoppingSnack.
- The issue was addressed in versions 10 and 11.0.5 of `ph-commons` by introducing a maximum nesting level to prevent the stack overflow.
- The fix is based on approaches used in `jackson-databind` and GSON which use depth limit and stack+iteration processing instead of recursion.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a deeply nested array structure.
