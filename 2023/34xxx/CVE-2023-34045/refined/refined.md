Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-34045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation that occurs during the initial installation of VMware Fusion when the application is dragged or copied from the .dmg volume to a folder or when installing an upgrade.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the VMware Fusion installer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a local, non-administrative user to escalate privileges to root on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. A malicious actor with local non-administrative user privileges can exploit the vulnerability during the installation process, specifically when the application is moved from the .dmg volume rather than double-clicking the application within the .dmg file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs local, non-administrative user privileges on the system where VMware Fusion is being installed for the first time or being upgraded. The attacker also needs to use the specific installation method, which involves dragging or copying the application from the '.dmg' volume.
