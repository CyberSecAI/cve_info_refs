VMware Fusion(13.x prior to 13.5) contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability that occurs during 
installation for the first time (the user needs to drag or copy the 
application to a folder from the '.dmg' volume) or when installing an 
upgrade. A malicious actor with local non-administrative user privileges may 
exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the system 
where Fusion is installed or being installed for the first time.
