Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `authenticate` function in Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) versions 2.0.0 and later would improperly strip parts of a URL separated by dots or slashes. This was done in an attempt to match patterns in its ruleset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The flawed URL parsing allowed an attacker to craft a malicious URL that would bypass the authentication checks, granting unauthorized access to PMM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access PMM logs.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Access to logs could further lead to privilege escalation, as log information might reveal sensitive details or configuration weaknesses.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed URL:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specially crafted URL to the PMM server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the PMM server.
*   If the PMM instance is accessible directly from the internet it's especially vulnerable.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all PMM versions starting with 2.0.0.
*   Percona released PMM version 2.37.1 to address this issue.
*   A workaround is provided for users who cannot immediately upgrade by modifying the NGINX configuration with a provided script.
* The vulnerability was reported by Adam Kues, a security researcher at Assetnote.
