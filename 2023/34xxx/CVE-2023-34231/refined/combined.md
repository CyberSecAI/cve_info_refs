# Snowflake Golang Driver Security Advisory

High

[sfc-gh-jfan](/sfc-gh-jfan)
published
GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c
Jun 8, 2023

## Package

gomod

gosnowflake
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.6.19

## Patched versions

1.6.19

## Description

### Issue

Snowflake was informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Golang driver via SSO browser URL authentication.

### Impacted driver package:

gosnowflake

### Impacted version range:

before [Version 1.6.19](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Go-Snowflake-Driver-Release-Notes)

### Attack Scenario

In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.

This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.

### Solution

On March 21, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Golang driver via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake Golang driver before Version 1.6.19. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 1.6.19 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Go Snowflake Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/golang/go-driver)

### Additional Information

If you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-34231

### Description

Added URL Validator to ensure that the SSO URL being used in external browser is valid. Also added URL Encoder to encode base64 strings to url safe format.

### Checklist

* Code compiles correctly
* Run `make fmt` to fix inconsistent formats
* Run `make lint` to get lint errors and fix all of them
* Created tests which fail without the change (if possible)
* All tests passing
* Extended the README / documentation, if necessary

Sorry, something went wrong.
