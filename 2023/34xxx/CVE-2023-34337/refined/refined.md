The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34337.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to CWE-326, which refers to the use of a weak or insufficient cryptographic key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient cryptographic key strength (CWE-326).

**Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), requiring the attacker to be on the same local network segment or have access to the BMC interface via a network connection. The attack requires the user to interact with the system in some way (UI:R).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) on the system being targeted. They also require adjacent access to the target. Additionally, some user interaction is needed to trigger the exploit.
The vulnerability is present in MegaRAC SPX versions prior to SPx_12.2 and SPx_13.0.
