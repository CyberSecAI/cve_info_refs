- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `conn_handler` function of `mqtt_parser.c` when processing malformed MQTT messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash (as evidenced by the ASan log) and potentially other security issues depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed MQTT message to the `nanomq` broker. Specifically crafted data can trigger the vulnerability in the `conn_handler` function during parsing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the `nanomq` broker, typically on port 1883 for MQTT, and construct a specific malformed packet to trigger the overflow.
