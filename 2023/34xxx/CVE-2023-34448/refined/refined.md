{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation in the `map()` and `reduce()` filters of the Twig templating engine within the Grav CMS. Although the `filter()` function was patched to prevent the use of dangerous functions, the `map()` and `reduce()` functions, which also allow the execution of arbitrary PHP functions via `array_map()` and `array_reduce()`, were left unprotected.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs",
      "CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker with appropriate privileges to achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the Grav CMS. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, data breaches, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to inject malicious Twig code into a page content within the Grav CMS, which is then processed by the Twig engine.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires either an administrator account or a user account with the following permissions:\n\n- Login access to Grav admin panel.\n- Page creation or update rights."
