# Snowflake Python Connector Security Advisory

High

[sfc-gh-jfan](/sfc-gh-jfan)
published
GHSA-5w5m-pfw9-c8fp
Jun 8, 2023

## Package

pip

snowflake-connector-python
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.2

## Patched versions

3.0.2

## Description

### Issue

Snowflake was informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication.

### Impacted driver package:

snowflake-connector-python

### Impacted version range:

before [Version 3.0.2](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Snowflake-Connector-for-Python-Release-Notes)

### Attack Scenario

In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.

This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.

### Solution

On March 23rd, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake Python connector before Version 3.0.2. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 3.0.2 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Snowflake Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector)

### Additional Information

If you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-34233

Please answer these questions before submitting your pull requests. Thanks!

1. What GitHub issue is this PR addressing? Make sure that there is an accompanying issue to your PR.

   Fixes [SNOW-761004](https://snowflakecomputing.atlassian.net/browse/SNOW-761004)
2. Fill out the following pre-review checklist:

   * I am adding a new automated test(s) to verify correctness of my new code
   * I am adding new logging messages
   * I am adding a new telemetry message
   * I am modifying authorization mechanisms
   * I am adding new credentials
   * I am modifying OCSP code
   * I am adding a new dependency
3. Please describe how your code solves the related issue.

   Currently Python connector does not ensure the validity of the SSO URL and just opens it in the browser. The connector should ensure that the URL is a valid HTTP / HTTPS URL before passing it to the Browser. This PR also adds support for URL encoding strings. This will be used later for encoding Base64 OCSP requests before sending them to the OCSP Responder.

Sorry, something went wrong.

When does `target` evaluate to `None`?

Why do we need this wrapper if it's just a one-liner calling `urllib.parse.quote_plus`?

This will be part of the OCSP Code base where we need to make sure all the OCSP Request besides being baset64 encoded are also URL Encoded. The OCSP Code base depends a lot on what is received int the certificate from the Certificate authority. If in case the information is bad and the certificate request generated turns out to be None this case should catch that. This utility function also gives us the ability to add more such cases which I am sure there will be.
