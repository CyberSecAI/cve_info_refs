- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unprivileged user (Subscriber) can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing a function without proper authorization.
