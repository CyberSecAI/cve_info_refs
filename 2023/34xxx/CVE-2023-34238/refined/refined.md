Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the Gatsby develop server exposing two endpoints (`__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame`) that were not properly validating file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where the application allows the inclusion of local files through the exposed endpoints.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `filePath` parameter in the `__file-code-frame` endpoint and `moduleId` parameter in `__original-stack-frame` endpoint were not validated against allowed paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts` in examples).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network when the development server is exposed.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by crafting specific HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoints, supplying the `filePath` or `moduleId` parameter with the path of a file to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the Gatsby development server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoints (`__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame`) and how to construct the request.
*   **Low Privilege Access**: As per CVSS score, low privileges are required for the attack.
*   **No User Interaction**: No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Gatsby versions prior to 4.25.7 and 5.9.1.
*   The default configuration of the Gatsby develop server only exposes the server to localhost, mitigating the risk unless the server is intentionally exposed to other interfaces.
*   The fix involves validating that the requested file is part of the webpack compilation process before serving it, preventing access to arbitrary files.
* The vulnerability was reported by Maxwell Garrett of Assetnote.
* The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score of 4.3, categorized as a moderate severity issue.
* The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-34238
