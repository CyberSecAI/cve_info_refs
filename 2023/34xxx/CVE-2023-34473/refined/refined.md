- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a hardcoded cryptographic key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-798, which refers to the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). This means that an attacker must be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device to exploit this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) and needs user interaction (UI:R).
