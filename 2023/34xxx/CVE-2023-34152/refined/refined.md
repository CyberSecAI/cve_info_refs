{
  "CVE-2023-34152": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. This security flaw cause a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenBlob with --enable-pipes configured.",
    "root_cause": "The `SanitizeString` function, used to sanitize input strings in `OpenBlob`, does not properly filter out backticks (`) and double quotes (\"), allowing for shell command injection when ImageMagick is configured with the `--enable-pipes` option.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Shell command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the system by crafting a malicious file name that includes backticks or double quotes when ImageMagick is processing it with pipes enabled.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted filename to ImageMagick when it is processing an image, potentially through a web server that uses ImageMagick to process user-uploaded files, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input filename passed to ImageMagick when it is compiled with --enable-pipes."
