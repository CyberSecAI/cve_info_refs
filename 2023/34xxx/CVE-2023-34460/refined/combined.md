# Regression on Filesystem Scope Checks for Dotfiles on Linux and macOS

Moderate

[tweidinger](/tweidinger)
published
GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm
Jun 21, 2023

## Package

cargo

tauri
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

=1.4.0

## Patched versions

>=1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Linux and macOS.

Previously dotfiles (eg. `$HOME/.ssh/`) were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented and dotfiles were implicitly allowed.

Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected.

Only macOS and Linux systems are affected.

### Patches

The regression has been patched on `v1.4.1`.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds at this time, users should update to `v1.4.1` immediately.

### References

See the [original advisory](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5) for more information.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-34460
