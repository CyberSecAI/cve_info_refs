{
  "Root cause": "A regression was introduced in version 1.4.0 where the filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Linux and macOS was unintentionally changed. A configuration option (`require_literal_leading_dot`) intended to control this behavior was implemented, but it flipped the default behavior of how dotfiles were handled.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Incorrect implementation of a configuration option leading to unintended behavior.",
    "Filesystem scope check bypass due to the regression."
  ],
  "Impact": "Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint could unintentionally allow access to dotfiles (e.g. `$HOME/.ssh/`). This could potentially expose sensitive data if dotfiles contain such information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint on macOS and Linux are vulnerable. An attacker could potentially access dotfiles by crafting an appropriate file path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to control or influence the file paths being accessed by a vulnerable Tauri application and be on a macOS or Linux system."
