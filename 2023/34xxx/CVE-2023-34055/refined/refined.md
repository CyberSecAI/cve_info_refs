This vulnerability, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS), exists when an application uses Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux and includes `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator` on the classpath. NetApp identifies that multiple of their products incorporate the vulnerable Spring Boot versions, but none are listed as affected.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a weakness in handling specially crafted HTTP requests within Spring Boot's web server components when the `spring-boot-actuator` is present.",
