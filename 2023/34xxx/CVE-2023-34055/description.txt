In Spring Boot versions 2.7.0 - 2.7.17, 3.0.0-3.0.12 and 3.1.0-3.1.5, it is possible for a user to provide specially crafted HTTP requests that may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:

  *  the application uses Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux
  *  org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuatorÂ is on the classpath
