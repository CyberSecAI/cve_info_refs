{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled parameter, `businessTable`, directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `ActDao.xml` mapper file where the `${businessTable}` parameter is used directly in the SQL query. When `allowMultiQueries=true` is enabled in the JDBC connection URL, this allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data modification or deletion. The provided example demonstrates deleting an entire table.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can manipulate the `businessTable` parameter in the `/a/act/task/start` URL to inject malicious SQL. This parameter is used within the vulnerable SQL query in the `ActDao.xml` mapper.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `businessTable` parameter. The attacker also needs to know that `allowMultiQueries=true` is set in the application's database connection configuration."
