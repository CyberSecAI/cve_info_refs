```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow in the `urlFilterList` function of the ASUS RT-N10LX router firmware. The `strcpy` function copies the user-provided URL parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking and insufficient buffer size for user-controlled input.
- Impact of exploitation: The overflow leads to a crash of the `httpd` process, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The router becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a URL parameter larger than the allocated buffer to the router's web interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same network as the router or having access to the router's web interface through port forwarding or other means.
