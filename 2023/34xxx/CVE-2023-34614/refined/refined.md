The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the `jsonij` library when parsing deeply nested JSON structures. This vulnerability aligns with the description for CVE-2023-34614 which refers to "Stack overflow error caused by jsonij parsing of untrusted JSON String".

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root Cause:** The `jsonij` parser uses recursive calls to parse nested JSON arrays, which can lead to a stack overflow when the nesting depth is too high.
*   **Weakness:** The parser lacks proper handling for deeply nested structures, leading to uncontrolled recursion and stack overflow.
*   **Impact:** A denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By providing a crafted JSON string with excessive nesting, an attacker can crash the application using the `jsonij` library.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by feeding maliciously crafted JSON strings to the parser. This is most likely via user supplied input or other external, potentially untrusted data sources.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a JSON string to the parser, typically through an API, file parsing, or any other means that uses the library. No special privileges are needed other than the ability to supply data to be parsed by jsonij.
