The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netbox version 3.5.1, specifically within the "Create Wireless LAN Groups" function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Name" field when creating a "Wireless LAN Group". This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious script injected in the "Name" field is stored by the application and executed in the context of other users who access the affected functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to full compromise of the user's session, including actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Data theft

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Netbox application.
- The attacker must have access to the "Wireless LAN Groups" creation function.
- The attacker inserts the malicious payload `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS');>` into the "Name" field when creating a "Wireless LAN Group".
- The XSS is triggered when another user views or edits the "Wireless LANs" and selects a group associated with the malicious payload

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user in the Netbox application.
- The attacker needs to have the privilege to create/edit "Wireless LAN Groups."
