The provided content describes two vulnerabilities found in the `fdkaac` project: a heap-buffer-overflow and a stack-buffer-overflow.

**Heap-buffer-overflow:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to a read operation beyond allocated memory when processing a malformed or crafted CAF input file. The `strlen` function attempts to read past the allocated buffer within `caf_info` function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Application crash due to memory corruption and potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted CAF file as input.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malformed CAF file to the program.

**Stack-buffer-overflow:**

*   **Root cause**: A stack-buffer-overflow vulnerability occurs in `read_callback()` function at src/main.c:81, where a large amount of data is written to a stack buffer, causing overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
*    **Impact of exploitation**: Application crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted input that causes `read_callback()` to write beyond buffer boundaries.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted input that triggers the overflow in `read_callback`.
