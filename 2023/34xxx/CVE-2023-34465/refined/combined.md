# Mail.MailConfig can be edited by any user with edit rights

Critical

[manuelleduc](/manuelleduc)
published
GHSA-g75c-cjr6-39mc
Jun 20, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-mail-send-default
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 11.8-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.4.8, 14.10.6, 15.1

## Description

### Impact

`Mail.MailConfig` can be edited by any logged-in user by default. Consequently, they can:

* change the mail obfuscation configuration
* view and edit the mail sending configuration, including the smtp domain name and credentials.

### Patches

The problem has been patched on XWiki 14.4.8, 15.1, and 14.10.6.

### Workarounds

The rights of the `Mail.MailConfig` page can be manually updated so that only a set of trusted users can view, edit and delete it (e.g., the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group).

On 14.4.8+, 15.1-rc-1+, or 14.10.5+, if at startup `Mail.MailConfig` does not have any rights defined, `view`, `edit`  and `delete` rights are automatically granted to the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group.

See the corresponding [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d28d7739089e1ae8961257d9da7135d1a01cb7d4).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

Mail.MailConfig is expected to be editable by admins only as it contains some configurations (e.g., the obfuscation of mails). But currently, there is no restrictions and it can be edited by any user with edit rights.

Mail.SendMailConfigClass in Mail.MailConfig can also be edited in the same way, allowing any user to redirect send mail to a rogue smtp server, allowing the received all emitted mails.
