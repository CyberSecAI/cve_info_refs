Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the `Mail.MailConfig` page and related objects within the XWiki platform. By default, any logged-in user with edit rights could modify this page. This misconfiguration allowed unauthorized users to change email settings, including sensitive information such as SMTP credentials, which are intended to be managed only by administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the insufficient restriction of access to the `Mail.MailConfig` page and its associated objects. The system failed to enforce that only administrators could modify the page and its sensitive configurations.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability led to the exposure of sensitive mail configurations, such as SMTP domain names and credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could view and modify mail configurations, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, including the SMTP credentials.
*   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers could modify the mail sending configuration, potentially redirecting emails to a rogue SMTP server, intercepting emails, or sending malicious emails through the compromised system.
*   **Availability Impact:**  While not directly stated, manipulating mail settings could disrupt the email services or system availability by changing mail configurations to invalid values.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the network, where any logged-in user with edit rights could access and modify the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker only needs a regular user account with edit rights on the XWiki platform to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation of the vulnerability requires no interaction from other users
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki platform

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked as XWIKI-20519 and XWIKI-20671 in the XWiki Jira.
*   The vulnerability is considered "Critical" with a CVSS score of 10.0.
*   Patches have been released in versions 14.4.8, 14.10.6, and 15.1 of XWiki.
*   A workaround involves manually updating the rights of the `Mail.MailConfig` page to restrict access to a group of trusted users, such as the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup`.
*   The fix addresses the issue by ensuring that, by default, the `Mail.MailConfig` page is only editable by administrators. If no rights are defined on the page at startup, view, edit, and delete rights are automatically given to the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup`.
*   The vulnerability is present in affected versions of the `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-mail-send-default` package.
*   The identified CWE is CWE-522, which pertains to insufficiently protected credentials.
