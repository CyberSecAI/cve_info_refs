The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34102.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `avo` gem does not validate user-supplied input for polymorphic field types, specifically when updating or creating records. It uses `safe_constantize` / `constantize` to find classes based on user input. This lack of validation allows an attacker to specify arbitrary class names, including those outside of the intended scope.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated user input for polymorphic type fields
- Usage of `safe_constantize` / `constantize` on user-provided class names without proper sanitization or validation against a whitelist.
- Lack of type validation in backend.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Creation of database entries with invalid or unexpected class names.
- Application crashes (partial denial of service) when viewing manipulated records or index views due to the application attempting to work with these invalid classes.
- Potential for remote code execution (though not fully tested) if the specified classes are instantiated in a way that allows it.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating HTTP POST requests when creating or updating records via the `avo` gem. Specifically by altering the `polymorphic_type` parameter.
- The attacker needs to intercept the request and modify the class name to be used by the polymorphic association.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need low privileges and network access to make these requests.
- The attacker has to be able to intercept and modify the parameters of the HTTP POST requests.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application interface that uses this vulnerable code.
