The provided content describes a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Grav CMS, specifically related to a bypass of a denylist intended to prevent the execution of dangerous functions via Twig templates.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient denylist implementation in the `Utils::isDangerousFunction()` method. This denylist was intended to prevent the execution of dangerous PHP functions through Twig templates. The denylist was bypassed using the following methods:

1.  **Unsafe functions not blocked**: The denylist did not include all potentially dangerous functions, such as `unserialize()`, `ini_alter()`, `simplexml_load_file()`, `simplexml_load_string()`, `forward_static_call()`, and `forward_static_call_array()`.
2.  **Case-sensitive comparison**: The denylist performed a case-sensitive check against the function names, while PHP function names are case-insensitive. This allowed attackers to use capitalized versions of blocked function names (e.g., `System` instead of `system`).
3.  **Fully qualified names**: The denylist did not prevent the use of fully-qualified names (e.g., `\system`) when referencing functions, which bypassed the check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs (CWE-184):** The denylist was missing critical dangerous functions.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine (CWE-1336):**  The inadequate filtering allowed for the injection of malicious code via Twig templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This is due to the ability to inject malicious Twig templates and execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically by:

1.  Gaining access to the Grav Admin panel
2.  Having the permission to create or update pages.
3.  Injecting malicious Twig templates within page content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have either administrator privileges, or a non-administrative account with:
    *   Login access to the Grav admin panel.
    *   Page creation or update permissions.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the Grav CMS web interface.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects Grav CMS versions up to and including v1.7.40.
*   The issue is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2022-2073.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2023-30592, CVE-2023-30593, and CVE-2023-30594, by STAR Labs.
