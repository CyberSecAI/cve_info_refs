- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Specially crafted HTTP requests can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in Reactor Netty HTTP Server when the built-in integration with Micrometer is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of specific HTTP requests when Micrometer integration is enabled in Reactor Netty HTTP Server. This allows an attacker to cause a DoS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially rendering the affected service unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service. No specific authentication or special network position is mentioned, indicating that this vulnerability is remotely exploitable by any attacker who can reach the service.
