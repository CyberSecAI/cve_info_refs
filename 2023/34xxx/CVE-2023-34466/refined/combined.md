#### Description

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Restrict "view" access to Sandbox.TestPage3 by setting an explicit view right for admins
2. Add a tag "X" to Sandbox.TestPage3
3. As a user who is not an admin, open <server>/bin/get/XWiki/LiveTableResults?outputSyntax=plain&classname=&collist=doc.title%2Cdoc.location%2Cdoc.content&doc.location=Sandbox.TestPage3&limit=1 where <server> is the URL of your XWiki installation.

**Expect Result:**

No tags are displayed as the user doesn't have view rights on Sandbox.TestPage3.

**Actual Result:**

The result

```

{"reqNo":null,"matchingtags":{"X":1},"tags":[{"tag":"X","count":1}],"totalrows":2,"returnedrows":1,"offset":1,"rows":[{"doc_viewable":false,"doc_fullName":"obfuscated"}]}

```

is displayed.

This reveals that Sandbox.TestPage3 has tag X.

The issue has been reproduced on 14.5 but is most likely older.

This information can also be exploited to infer the document reference of non-viewable pages.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0 RC1.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
