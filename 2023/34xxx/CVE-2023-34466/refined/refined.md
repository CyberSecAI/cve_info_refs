Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the LiveTable API in XWiki not properly enforcing view access rights when retrieving tags. Specifically, the API returns tags associated with pages even when the requesting user does not have view permissions for those pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the exposure of tag information from restricted pages to unauthorized users.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The LiveTable API bypasses the intended access control mechanisms for pages and their associated tags.
- **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The application does not properly check user permissions before returning tag data, leading to the information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can learn about tags applied to restricted content, potentially revealing sensitive information or context about those pages.
- **Document Reference Inference:** Attackers can infer the existence and document reference of non-viewable pages based on the returned tag information, giving them insight into the system's structure.
- **Confidentiality Loss:** Unauthorized users can gain knowledge of information they are not meant to access, leading to a loss of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based since the attacker exploits the vulnerability through an API endpoint (`/bin/get/XWiki/LiveTableResults`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a user with low privileges on the system. No special permissions or elevated access is required.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable XWiki instance to send requests to the LiveTable API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of the API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the endpoint of the API they are targeting.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in XWiki versions 5.0-milestone-1 and possibly older versions.
- Patches were released for versions 15.0-rc-1, 14.4.8, and 14.10.4.
- The issue is related to other information leakage vulnerabilities related to tags in XWiki.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
