The provided content relates to CVE-2023-34645.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `${printFile(...)}` function within the template management feature, which allows for arbitrary file reading. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user input, allowing an attacker to provide a path to a sensitive file, which is then processed by the `printFile()` function and the contents are displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file reading vulnerability via the `${printFile()}` function.
- Lack of input sanitization and validation within the template management feature.
- Exposes the application's file system to unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential information.
- This could lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation or data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to access the template management feature of the application. This likely requires authentication.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload using the `${printFile()}` function with a file path.
- This payload is inserted in a template such as `/template/includes/jquery.html` via the CMS editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the CMS administrative panel.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the templates or at least one template like /template/includes/jquery.html to insert the malicious payload.
