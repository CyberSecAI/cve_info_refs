# CVE-2023-34088 Stored Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in admin interface

Critical

[caolanm](/caolanm)
published
GHSA-7582-pwfh-3pwr
May 31, 2023

## Package

coolwsd

## Affected versions

< 22.05.13
< 21.11.9.1

## Patched versions

22.05.13
21.11.9.1

loolwsd

< 6.4.27

6.4.27

## Description

### Impact

A stored XSS vulnerability was found in Collabora Online. An attacker could create a document with an XSS payload as a document name. Later, if an administrator opens the admin console and navigates to the history page the document name is injected as unescaped HTML and executed as a script inside the context of the admin console. The administrator JWT used for the websocket connection can be leaked through this flaw.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to Collabora Online 22.05.13 or higher; Collabora Online 21.11.9.1 or higher; Collabora Online 6.4.27 or higher.

### Credits

Thanks to René de Sain ([@renniepak](https://github.com/renniepak)) for reporting this flaw.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
