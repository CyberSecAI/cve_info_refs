{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The xml-rs crate's lexer had an `unreachable!()` call within the `Token::fmt` implementation, which could be triggered by malformed XML input containing an invalid `<!` token, leading to a panic and denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling leading to a crash",
        "Denial of Service (DoS) due to a panic"
     ],
    "impact": "A malformed XML document with a specific invalid token can cause the xml-rs crate to panic, leading to a denial of service. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by an attacker by supplying the malformed XML to a service using the vulnerable library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Malformed XML input containing an invalid `<!` token"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to supply a specifically crafted malformed XML document to the vulnerable library. No special privileges or user interaction is required.",
      "details": "The vulnerability stems from how the xml-rs library handles invalid `<!` tokens during parsing, leading to an `unreachable!()` macro call that causes a panic. This occurs when the parser encounters an invalid `<!` token in an unexpected location, such as within a DOCTYPE declaration or an entity value. The vulnerability is triggered during the formatting of the token for an error message, and therefore the crash is not prevented by disabling errors. \n\nThe issue was introduced in commit `014d808`, which adds support for parsing some DOCTYPE declarations (but not fully implemented DTD parsing) and is fixed by commit `c09549a`, which replaces the `unreachable!()` with an error reporting mechanism."
