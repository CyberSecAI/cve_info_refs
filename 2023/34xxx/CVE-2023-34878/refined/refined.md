Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `com.ujcms.cms.core.web.backendapi.AbstractWebFileController#downloadZip` function when handling the `dir` and `names` parameters used to download zip packages. Specifically, there's a lack of restriction on accessible directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `checkId` method does not properly validate the `dir` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths, such as `WEB-INF/`.
*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** By manipulating the `dir` and `names` parameters, an attacker can download sensitive files outside of the intended directories, including source code, configuration files, and other sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as source code, database connection details, and other configuration information.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposure of source code and configuration details could facilitate further attacks, such as identifying additional vulnerabilities or gaining deeper access into the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `downloadZip` endpoint, providing a manipulated `dir` parameter (e.g., `dir=WEB-INF/`) and `names` parameter (e.g., `names=classes`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint or have the ability to enumerate available endpoints.
*   The application must be deployed using Tomcat.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Ujcms v6.0.2.
*   The `checkName` method also has flaws, allowing empty filenames or filenames with illegal characters.
*   The provided images within the content show how an attacker can manipulate the parameters and download files they are not authorized to access.
