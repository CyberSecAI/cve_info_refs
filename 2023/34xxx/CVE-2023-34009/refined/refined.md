- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is present in the plugin, and exploitation would involve triggering the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user) of the WordPress site.
