- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect caching invalidation guidelines in the AMD-Vi specification leading to stale DMA mappings when certain DTE fields are updated without flushing the IOMMU TLB.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stale DMA mappings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, and information leaks.
- **Attack vectors:** x86 guests with physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability by manipulating DMA mappings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have control over a guest with physical devices passed through to it on a vulnerable x86 AMD system with IOMMU hardware.
