Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a result of missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core issue is a "Broken Access Control" vulnerability. This means that the plugin does not properly verify if the user performing an action has the required permissions to do so.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:  The impact of this vulnerability is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited. However, successful exploitation could lead to an unprivileged user performing actions they shouldn't be able to.

*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function that does not have the proper access control checks in place.  This could be achieved by a user with 'Subscriber' privileges.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least the privileges of a "Subscriber" to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability is present in Grid Plus plugin versions <= 1.3.2.
* Version 1.3.3 of the plugin includes a fix for this vulnerability.
* Patchstack provides a virtual patch to mitigate the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
* The CVSS score is 5.4 which is considered a low severity.
