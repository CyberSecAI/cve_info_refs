- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `$_POST['pid']` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify database contents, or even take control of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable admin pages with malicious SQL code injected into the vulnerable parameters (such as `pid`, `cid`, `lid`, `tid`, `userid`, `gid`), an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker must have access to the admin panel of the CMS.
