  "CVE-2023-34153": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. This security flaw causes a shell command injection vulnerability via video:vsync or video:pixel-format options in VIDEO encoding/decoding.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when handling the `video:vsync` or `video:pixel-format` options during video encoding/decoding in ImageMagick. Specifically, the values of these options are concatenated into a delegate command which is then executed using the system() function without proper sanitization of quote characters, leading to potential shell command injection.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Shell command injection",
         "Insufficient input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system. This can result in complete compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, or destruction.",
       "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes a crafted video file or image with malicious `video:vsync` or `video:pixel-format` options using the convert or identify command.",
          "The malicious options can be supplied through command line arguments."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide a malicious video or image file, or control the command line arguments passed to the ImageMagick convert/identify tools.",
         "required_position": "The attacker does not need a privileged position, and can exploit the vulnerability by making the vulnerable service process a crafted file or providing malicious command line parameters."

    "affected_software": {
      "name": "ImageMagick",
      "versions": "All versions before 7.1.1.11 are vulnerable"
