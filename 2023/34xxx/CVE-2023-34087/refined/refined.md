Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34087:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how GTKWave parses EVCD files, specifically within the `evcd_main` function of the `evcd2vcd` utility. The root cause is an improper array index validation when handling variable lengths declared within the file.  The program uses an attacker controlled value as an index into a stack buffer without proper bounds checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Array Index Validation (CWE-119):** The core vulnerability is a lack of proper bounds checking when accessing the `bin_fixbuff` array. The code reads a length value from the EVCD file and uses it directly as an index into `bin_fixbuff` without confirming that the index is within the valid range of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a crafted EVCD file, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow by writing a null byte at an arbitrary memory location. This write can be triggered multiple times leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Parsing:** The attack vector is an EVCD file crafted by an attacker to have a specific length value in the `$var` section that triggers the out-of-bounds write when the file is processed.
*  **User Interaction:**  A user must open a malicious `.evcd` file using the `evcd2vcd` utility to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious EVCD file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted EVCD file.
*   **Victim interaction**: The attacker would need to convince a user to open the crafted file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `evcd_main` function parses EVCD files.
*   A stack buffer `bin_fixbuff` of size 32769 bytes is allocated.
*   The `$var` section of the EVCD file specifies signal information including a length, which is stored in the `vcd_ids` hash table in the `val2.i` field.
*   Later on, when the file is processed a length is retrieved from the hash table and used as an index to `bin_fixbuff`: `bin_fixbuff[node->val2.i] = 0;`
*   Because the length `node->val2.i` is read directly from the file, an attacker can specify an arbitrary index value which can lead to an out-of-bounds write on the stack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided crash information clearly demonstrates a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   The fix involved upgrading to version 3.3.118.
*   The vulnerability is present in GTKWave 3.3.115.
