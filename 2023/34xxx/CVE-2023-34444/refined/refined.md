- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input when displaying the `pages/ajax.searchform.php` page, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability allows scripts to be injected outside of script tags.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: Network-based attack via a crafted request to the vulnerable `pages/ajax.searchform.php`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable page, which is accessible over the network. No special privileges are needed and user interaction (clicking a malicious link or navigating to a crafted page) is required.
