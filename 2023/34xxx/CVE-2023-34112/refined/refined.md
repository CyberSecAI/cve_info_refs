- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The GitHub Actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` repository use the `github.event.head_commit.message` parameter in an insecure way. The commit message is directly used in a run statement which leads to command injection vulnerability via string interpolation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection, use of untrusted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on GitHub runners, potentially leading to crypto-mining and resource wastage, and exfiltration of secrets used in CI pipeline, including repository tokens.
- **Attack vectors:** A user creates a pull request with a malicious commit message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a pull request on the affected repository. The vulnerability can be triggered even with a valid first commit.
