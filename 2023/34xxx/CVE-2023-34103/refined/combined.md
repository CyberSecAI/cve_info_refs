# Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting) in html content based fields

High

[adrianthedev](/adrianthedev)
published
GHSA-5cr9-5jx3-2g39
Jun 5, 2023

## Package

bundler

avo
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

2.33.2, 3.0.0.pre12

## Patched versions

2.33.3

## Description

### Summary

Some avo fields are vulnerable to XSS when rendering html based content.

### Details

During the analysis of the web application, a rendered field was discovered that did not filter JS / HTML tags in a safe way and can be abused to execute js code on a client side. The trix field uses the trix editor in the backend to edit rich text data which basically operates with html tags. To display the stored data in a rendered view, the HasHTMLAttributes concern is used. This can be exploited by an attacker to store javascript code in any trix field by intercepting the request and modifying the post data, as the trix editor does not allow adding custom html or js tags on the frontend.

### PoC

*Adding javascript in the post request which is used when editing a "post" resource (body is declared as a trix field)*

*Successful execution of JS code on live demo environment*

### Impact

Unlike non-persistent XSS, persistent XSS does not require a social engineering phase. Victims of this attack do not need to be tricked into clicking a link or something like that. However, by exploiting such a vulnerability on this particular target, attackers may be able to gain access to accounts that require special protection, such as administrators of the web service, which is what Avo is primarily intended to be used for.

### Recommendation

The content of a field that contains html code should be sanitized using the according rails helper which uses a whitelist of known-safe tags and attributes. Also this security consideration should be applied to the “as\_html” attribute as well because it may contain user controlled input as well.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
