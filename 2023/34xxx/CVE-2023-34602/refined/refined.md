Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `${XXX}` in MyBatis within the `queryTableDictItemsByCode` method of the `org.jeecg.modules.api.controller.SystemApiController` class. This allows for direct SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The use of `${XXX}` in MyBatis allows unsanitized user input to be directly embedded into the SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
- The code has SQL injection filtering functionality, but it's not effective in this specific case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and salt values from the `sys_user` table.
- The attacker can potentially manipulate the data in the database
- The attacker could potentially gain full control over the database

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/sys/api/queryTableDictItemsByCode` endpoint.
- **Manipulated parameters**: Specifically, the `table`, `text`, and `code` parameters can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account and corresponding X-Access-Token, X-Sign and X-TIMESTAMP to bypass the authentication interceptor. This implies that the attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of API:** Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and its parameters is necessary for crafting the malicious request.

**Technical details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `queryTableDictItemsByCode` method of the `org.jeecg.modules.api.controller.SystemApiController` class.
- The attacker can inject SQL code by manipulating the `table`, `text`, and `code` parameters in the HTTP request.
- The `${XXX}` syntax used in MyBatis allows direct insertion of the provided string into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Example exploit URLs included in the report demonstrate extracting `password` and `salt` values using SQL injection.
    -  `http://localhost:8080/jeecg-boot/sys/api/queryTableDictItemsByCode?table=sys_user&text=password as "text", username as "value" from sys_user --&code=username`
   -  `http://localhost:8080/jeecg-boot/sys/api/queryTableDictItemsByCode?table=sys_user&text=password as "text", salt as "value" from sys_user --&code=username`

**Versions Affected:**

- JeecgBoot version 3.5.1 and all prior versions are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

- The issue was addressed by adding a blacklist for SQL keywords as mentioned in the comment.
- The code changes have been committed.
