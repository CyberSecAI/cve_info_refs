{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "libfsimage contains parsing code for several filesystems, most of them based on grub-legacy code.  A stack buffer overflow can be triggered in libfsimage.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow in libfsimage"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A guest using pygrub can escalate its privilege to that of the domain construction tools, potentially leading to control of the host.",
  "Attack vectors": "A guest can present a modified disk image to pygrub, exploiting vulnerabilities in libfsimage during filesystem parsing.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the disk image presented to pygrub, which is typically a guest virtual machine."
