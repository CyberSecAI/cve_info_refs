[`4061cdf`](/cilium/cilium/commit/4061cdfc83370200e3f9a0c5a782ca17a288ae71)

We are pleased to release Cilium v1.13.4.

This release addresses the following security issue:

* [GHSA-r7wr-4w5q-55m6](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-r7wr-4w5q-55m6)

It aslso contains fixes related to IPsec, datapath drop notifications, CPU overhead, downgrade path, RevSNAT for ICMPv6, as well as a range of other regular bugfixes.

See the notes below for a full description of the changes.

## ⚠️ Warning - IPsec ⚠️

**Do NOT upgrade to this release if you are using IPsec.**

## Summary of Changes

**Minor Changes:**

* Add agent flag `enable-ipsec-key-watcher` to allow users to disable the IPsec key watcher and thus require an agent restart for the key rotation to take effect. (Backport PR [#25977](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25977), Upstream PR [#25893](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25893), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Updating documentation helm values now works also on arm64. (Backport PR [#25731](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25731), Upstream PR [#25422](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25422), [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme))

**Bugfixes:**

* Add drop notifications for various error paths in the datapath. (Backport PR [#25503](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25503), Upstream PR [#25183](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25183), [@julianwiedmann](https://github.com/julianwiedmann))
* bpf,datapath: read jiffies from /proc/schedstat (Backport PR [#25855](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25855), Upstream PR [#25795](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25795), [@ti-mo](https://github.com/ti-mo))
* Compare annotations before discarding CiliumNode updates. (Backport PR [#25588](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25588), Upstream PR [#25465](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25465), [@LynneD](https://github.com/LynneD))
* CPU overhead regression introduced in v1.13 is fixed. ([#25548](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25548), [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme))
* Fix a bug due to which we would leak Linux XFRM policies, potentially leading to increased CPU consumption, when IPsec is enabled with Azure or ENI IPAM. (Backport PR [#25897](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25897), Upstream PR [#25784](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25784), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Fix a bug that would cause connectivity drops of type XfrmInNoStates on upgrade when IPsec is enabled with ENI or Azure IPAM mode. (Backport PR [#25897](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25897), Upstream PR [#25724](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25724), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Fix a bug that would cause connectivity drops of type XfrmOutPolBlock on upgrade when IPsec is enabled. (Backport PR [#25897](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25897), Upstream PR [#25735](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25735), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Fix a possible deadlock when using WireGuard transparent encryption. (Backport PR [#25923](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25923), Upstream PR [#25419](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25419), [@bimmlerd](https://github.com/bimmlerd))
* Fix bug affecting EKS installations with IPsec encryption enabled, where Cilium wouldn't attach its IPsec BPF program to new ENI interfaces, resulting in connectivity loss between pods on remote nodes. (Backport PR [#25897](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25897), Upstream PR [#25744](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25744), [@joamaki](https://github.com/joamaki))
* Fix downgrade path from 1.14 to 1.13 due to stale IPAM-allocated IPv6 on cilium\_host ([#25962](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25962), [@jschwinger233](https://github.com/jschwinger233))
* Fix false error log message when IPsec is enabled with IPAM modes ENI or Azure and a remote node is deleted. (Backport PR [#26160](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/26160), Upstream PR [#26093](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/26093), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Fix incorrect hubble flow data when HTTP requests contain an `x-forwarded-for` header by adding an explicit `use_remote_address: true` config to Envoy HTTP configuration to always use the actual remote address of the incoming connection rather than the value of `x-forwarded-for` header, which may originate from an untrusted source. This change has no effect on Cilium policy enforcement where the source security identity is always resolved before HTTP headers are parsed. Previous Cilium behavior of not adding `x-forwarded-for` headers is retained via an explicit `skip_xff_append: true` config setting, except for Cilium Ingress where the source IP address is now appended to `x-forwarded-for` header. (Backport PR [#25731](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25731), Upstream PR [#25674](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25674), [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme))
* Fix leak of IPsec XFRM FWD policies in IPAM modes `cluster-pool`, `kubernetes`, and `crd` when nodes are deleted. Fix incorrect catch-all default-drop XFRM OUT policy for IPsec IPv6 traffic that could lead to leaking plain-text IPv6 traffic if combined with some other bug. (Backport PR [#26079](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/26079), Upstream PR [#25953](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25953), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))
* Fix missing drop notifications on conntrack lookup failures when IPv4 and IPv6 are both enabled or socket-level load balancing is disabled. (Backport PR [#25588](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25588), Upstream PR [#25426](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25426), [@bleggett](https://github.com/bleggett))
* Fix RevSNAT for ICMPv6 packets. (Backport PR [#25503](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25503), Upstream PR [#25306](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25306), [@julianwiedmann](https://github.com/julianwiedmann))
* Fix three issues in the bug fix to attach IPsec BPF programs to ENI interfaces: do not fatal if loading unexpectedly fails (which may happen if the device is suddenly deleted), ignore veth device changes in order not to reinitialize when new endpoints appear and wait 1 second for further device state changes between reinitializations. (Backport PR [#25977](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25977), Upstream PR [#25936](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25936), [@joamaki](https://github.com/joamaki))
* Fixed Cilium agent crash when policy refers to a non-existing Envoy listener. (Backport PR [#26079](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/26079), Upstream PR [#25969](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25969), [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme))
* gateway-api: Race condition between routes and Gateway (Backport PR [#25731](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25731), Upstream PR [#25573](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25573), [@sayboras](https://github.com/sayboras))
* gateway-api: Skip reconciliation for non-matching controller routes (Backport PR [#25731](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25731), Upstream PR [#25549](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25549), [@sayboras](https://github.com/sayboras))
* helm: Correct typo in Ingress validation (Backport PR [#25731](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25731), Upstream PR [#25570](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25570), [@sayboras](https://github.com/sayboras))
* Reject incorrect configuration enable-host-legacy-routing=false kube-proxy-replacement=partial. (Backport PR [#25855](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25855), Upstream PR [#25803](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/25803), [@pchaigno](https://github.com/pchaigno))

# Information disclosure via incorrect ReferenceGrant handling

Low

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-r7wr-4w5q-55m6
Jun 15, 2023

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

< 1.13.4

## Patched versions

1.13.4

## Description

### Impact

When the [Gateway API](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.13/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/gateway-api/) is enabled in Cilium, the absence of a check on the namespace in which a [ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/) is created could result in Cilium gaining visibility of secrets (including certificates) and services across namespaces.

An attacker on an affected cluster can configure Cilium to use cluster secrets or communicate with services that it should not have access to.

Gateway API functionality is disabled by default.

### Patches

This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium release 1.13.4.

Cilium versions <1.13 are not affected.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this issue.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@meyskens](https://github.com/meyskens) for investigating and fixing the issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

As usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
