Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the changes made to address a potential security issue with SVG file uploads:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that uploaded SVG files were not being sanitized, which could allow malicious SVG files to be uploaded. SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript that can be executed when the file is rendered, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of sanitization of SVG files before storage.
- Potential for XSS attacks via malicious SVG files.
- Execution of untrusted code through uploaded SVG files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS attacks could lead to unauthorized actions by the user.
- Cookie theft is possible, which could lead to hijacking a user's session.
- Potential for redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Potential manipulation of the application's data or behavior via client-side JavaScript.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading malicious SVG files via any upload functionality in the application that accepts such files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the application.  This typically means they need an account.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to create malicious SVG files that execute JavaScript.

**Technical Details:**

The provided commits address the issue as follows:
1. **Commit f6e8355:** Introduces a dependency on `enshrined/svg-sanitize` using composer. This dependency will be used to sanitize SVG content.
2. **Commit 0d0c88c:** Implements the `sanitizeSvgFile` function, which:
    - Checks if a given file is an SVG file using `mime_content_type`.
    - Reads the SVG file content using `file_get_contents`.
    - Uses `enshrined\svgSanitize\Sanitizer` to sanitize the SVG content.
    - Writes the sanitized content back to the file using `file_put_contents`.
    - The `sanitizeSvgFile` is called whenever a file is uploaded.

This change aims to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities by sanitizing SVG files before they are stored and served to users.
