# Remote code execution via specially crafted script settings

Moderate

[Safihre](/Safihre)
published
GHSA-hhgh-xgh3-985r
Jun 7, 2023

## Package

SABnzbd

## Affected versions

1.1.0-4.0.2RC1

## Patched versions

> 4.0.2RC1

## Description

### Description

A design flaw was discovered in SABnzbd that could allow remote code execution. Manipulating the Parameters setting in the Notification Script functionality allows code execution with the privileges of the SABnzbd process.

The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by [@mullerdavid](https://github.com/mullerdavid).

### Impact

Exploiting the vulnerabilities requires access to the web interface. Remote exploitation is possible if users [exposed their setup](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/configuration/4.0/general) to the internet or other untrusted networks without setting a username/password. By default SABnzbd is only accessible from `localhost`, with no authentication required for the web interface.

### Patches

Patched in [e3a722](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/commit/e3a722664819d1c7c8fab97144cc299b1c18b429) and [422b4f](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/commit/422b4fce7bfd56e95a315be0400cdfdc585df7cc). These were released as part of SABnzbd 4.0.2.

### Workarounds

Set a [username and password](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/configuration/4.0/general) to prevent unauthorized access to the web interface and/or update to a [fixed](https://sabnzbd.org/downloads) version.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory you can open an issue or a discussion in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-34237

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
