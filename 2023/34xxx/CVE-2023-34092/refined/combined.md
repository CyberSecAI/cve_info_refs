# Vite Server Options (server.fs.deny) can be bypassed using double forward-slash (//)

## Package

npm

vite
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

2.9.15
>=3.0.2 <=3.2.6
>=4.0.0 <=4.0.4
>=4.1.0 <=4.1.4
>=4.2.0 <=4.2.2
>=4.3.0 <=4.3.8

## Patched versions

>=2.9.16 <3.0.0
>=3.2.7 <4.0.0
>=4.0.5 <4.1.0
>=4.1.5 <4.2.0
>=4.2.3 <4.3.0
>=4.3.9

## Description

### Summary

Vite Server Options (`server.fs.deny`) can be bypassed using double forward-slash (//) allows any unauthenticated user to read file from the Vite root-path of the application including the default [`fs.deny` settings](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-deny) (`['.env', '.env.*', '*.{crt,pem}']`)

### Impact

Only users explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or [`server.host` config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host)) are affected, and only files in the immediate Vite project root folder could be exposed.

### Patches

Fixed in vite@4.3.9, vite@4.2.3, vite@4.1.5, vite@4.0.5

And in the latest minors of the previous two majors: vite@3.2.7, vite@2.9.16

### Details

Vite serve the application with under the root-path of the project while running on the dev mode. By default, vite using server options fs.deny to protected the sensitive information of the file. But, with simply double forward-slash, we can bypass this fs restriction.

### PoC

1. Create a new latest project of vite using any package manager. (here I'm using react and vue templates for tested and pnpm)
2. Serve the application on dev mode using pnpm run dev.
3. Directly access the file from url using double forward-slash (`//`) (e.g: `//.env`, `//.env.local`)
4. Server Options `fs.deny` restrict successfully bypassed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
