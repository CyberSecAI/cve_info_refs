  "CVE-2023-34151": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. This security flaw ouccers as an undefined behaviors of casting double to size_t in svg, mvg and other coders (recurring bugs of CVE-2022-32546).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from undefined behavior when casting a `double` value to a `size_t` in the SVG, MVG, and other coders. Specifically, when a floating-point number representing image dimensions is converted to an integer type (`size_t`) without proper bounds checking or sanitization, it can lead to out-of-range values, resulting in integer overflows.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
       "Type Casting Issues"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to application crashes, negative image sizes, memory corruption, or other undefined behaviors.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file (e.g., SVG or MVG) with very large width and height values defined using floating-point numbers that cause an integer overflow upon conversion to size_t.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to ImageMagick, either through a user uploading the image file, or by other means (e.g., a web service processing user-provided images)."
