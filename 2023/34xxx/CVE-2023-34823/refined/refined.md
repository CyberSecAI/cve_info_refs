The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities discovered in the fdkaac project: a heap-buffer-overflow and a stack-buffer-overflow.

**1. Heap-buffer-overflow:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability occurs within the `caf_info` function in `src/caf_reader.c`, specifically at line 116 during a `strlen` operation. The `strlen` attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to incorrect string length calculation or handling when reading a CAF file.
*   **Impact:** A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Processing a crafted CAF file can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted CAF file that triggers the overflow in `caf_info` function.

**2. Stack-buffer-overflow:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability occurs within the `read_callback` function in `src/main.c:81`, where a large write operation overflows the stack allocated buffer. The ASAN output indicates the overflow occurs when writing 19584 bytes.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stack-buffer-overflow due to insufficient size of the stack buffer allocated in `read_callback` function.
*  **Impact:**  A stack-buffer-overflow can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Inputting data that causes a large write through `read_callback` can trigger the overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide specific input which results in large data being processed by `read_callback`.

The report provides ASAN (AddressSanitizer) outputs, indicating the exact locations and nature of the overflows. The issue was reported and fixed in commit `22dbf72`. The crash input for the heap overflow is also provided.
