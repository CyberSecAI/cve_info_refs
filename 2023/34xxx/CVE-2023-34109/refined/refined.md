The provided content is a commit diff from the `zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn` repository on GitHub. The commit message `fix(user-inputs): resolve memory leak with user inputs on the fly` suggests that a memory leak related to user inputs has been addressed.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message indicates a memory leak related to how user inputs were handled. The code diff shows changes in the way `userInputs` are processed and stored within the `Options` class. Specifically, it seems like the `extendUserInputsDictionary` and `getRankedDictionary` methods were not efficiently handling dynamic updates to the user input dictionary, potentially leading to the leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability was a memory leak that arose from how `userInputs` were processed and stored in the `Options` class, specifically in the `extendUserInputsDictionary` and `getRankedDictionary` methods.
- **Inefficient Handling of Dynamic Data:** The code was not correctly handling dynamically added user input strings, which grew over time without being efficiently cleared and/or managed, causing memory usage to increase.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Increased Memory Consumption:** Repeatedly providing/updating user inputs could lead to the application consuming more and more memory over time.
- **Application Instability/Crash:** If the leak went unchecked, the application could eventually become unstable or crash due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Repeated API Calls:** An attacker could repeatedly call the API endpoints that add user inputs to the `Options` dictionary, causing the `userInputs` dictionary to grow unboundedly over time.
- **Manipulated User Inputs:** Although not explicitly mentioned, it's implied that the vulnerability is related to the processing of dynamically supplied user inputs, making the source of the inputs part of the vector to trigger this behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide user inputs to the application, specifically those that will be added to the `userInputs` dictionary within the `Options` class. This would typically be through an API or other means of adding user-provided data to be processed.

**Additional details from the diff:**
- The commit replaces the `getRankedDictionariesMaxWordSize` method to correctly determine the maximum word size for the given list.
- The method `getRankedDictionary` is modified to properly handle user inputs by creating a `sanitizedInputs` array that is built using `.toString().toLowerCase()` on each element from user inputs.
- The `extendUserInputsDictionary` method is updated to prevent memory leaks and manage user input extension properly. It now creates a new list with concatenated inputs, instead of appending to the current list, and then calculates `rankedDictionaries.userInputs` and `rankedDictionariesMaxWordSize.userInputs`
