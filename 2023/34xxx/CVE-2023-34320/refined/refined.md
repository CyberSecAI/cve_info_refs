- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An erratum (1508412) in Arm Cortex-A77 cores (r0p0 and r1p0) can lead to a deadlock. This occurs when a load to device or non-cacheable memory is executed in close proximity to either a store exclusive or a register read of the Physical Address Register (PAR_EL1).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the hardware erratum of the Cortex-A77 core and a lack of a software workaround to prevent the described deadlock situation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious guest can trigger the deadlock by executing the specific sequence of instructions, which will lead to a system-wide deadlock.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious guest OS can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control of a guest OS running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor. The attacker must be able to execute specific instructions within the guest OS.
