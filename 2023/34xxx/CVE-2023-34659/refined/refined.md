- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user-supplied input being directly concatenated into a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/show` endpoint is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    - Lack of Authorization: The vulnerability is described as "unauthorized," meaning the injection can be performed without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example demonstrates extracting database name using error-based SQL injection, and thus other data can be extracted.
    - Potential for data manipulation or other database attacks: By using SQL injection, an attacker may also be able to alter data or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP Request: The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/show` endpoint, with the malicious SQL payload injected in the `id` parameter within the `params` JSON object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access: An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for this specific exploit.
