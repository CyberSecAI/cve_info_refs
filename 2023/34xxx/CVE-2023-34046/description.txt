VMware Fusion(13.x prior to 13.5) contains a TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) 
vulnerability that occurs during installation for the first time (the 
user needs to drag or copy the application to a folder from the '.dmg' 
volume) or when installing an upgrade. A malicious actor with local non-administrative user privileges may 
exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the system 
where Fusion is installed or being installed for the first time.
