Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-34046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- VMware Fusion contains a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A TOCTOU vulnerability exists during the installation process of VMware Fusion, specifically when the application is dragged or copied from the '.dmg' volume to a folder, or during an upgrade installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a local non-administrative user to escalate their privileges to root on the system where VMware Fusion is being installed or is already installed. This gives the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the initial installation or upgrade process when the user manually moves the application from the .dmg file instead of using the usual method (double-clicking the app within the .dmg).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local non-administrative user privileges on the system.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to install or upgrade VMWare Fusion by manually dragging the application instead of executing the installer by double-clicking the app in the .dmg volume.
- The attacker needs user interaction to execute the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability will not occur if the user follows the usual installation process of double-clicking the application within the '.dmg' volume.
- This vulnerability is rated as "moderate" in severity with a CVSSv3 base score of 6.7.
- The vulnerability is addressed in VMware Fusion version 13.5.
