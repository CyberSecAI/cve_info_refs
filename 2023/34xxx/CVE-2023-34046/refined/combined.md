##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple security vulnerabilities in VMware Workstation and Fusion were responsibly reported to VMware. Updates are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in the affected VMware products.

##### **3a. Information disclosure vulnerability in bluetooth device-sharing functionality (CVE-2023-34044)**

**Description**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that exists in the functionality for sharing host Bluetooth devices with the virtual machine. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may be able to read privileged information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2023-34044 update to the version listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

[KB91760](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/91760)

**Additional Documentation**

None

**Notes**

This issue exists because Workstation 17.0.2 and Fusion 13.0.2, released on April 25, 2023 did not address CVE-2023-20870 completely.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Gwangun Jung (@pr0Ln) at THEORI working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue to us.

##### **3b. VMware Fusion TOCTOU local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2023-34046)**

**Description**

VMware Fusion contains a TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) vulnerability that occurs during installation for the first time (the user needs to drag or copy the application to a folder from the '.dmg' volume) or when installing an upgrade. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [6.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with local non-administrative user privileges may exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root on the system where Fusion is installed or being installed for the first time.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2023-34046 update to the version listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None

**Additional Documentation**

None

**Notes**

This will not occur if the user follows the usual process of double-clicking the application in the '.dmg' volume when running the installer for the first time.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Mickey Jin (@patch1t) for reporting this issue to us.
