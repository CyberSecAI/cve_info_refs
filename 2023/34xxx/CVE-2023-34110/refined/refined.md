Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-34110

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error handling when processing user input in the add and edit user forms. Specifically, when a database error occurs due to a special character in the input, the raw error message, which can include sensitive information, is displayed in the UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive database information, including the `pbkdf2:sha256` hashed password in certain database engines.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The application fails to sanitize or handle database errors properly, leading to the display of raw database error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to user passwords (albeit hashed) by triggering the database error. This can allow further attacks such as password cracking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker interacts with the web application over the network.
- **User Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the add/edit user forms in the UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the user management forms.
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to insert special characters or specific strings to trigger the database error during user creation or editing.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `flask-appbuilder` package, specifically in versions before 4.3.2.
- The vulnerability is triggered through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to user management.
- The database error, when triggered, surfaces the raw exception message back to the user interface.
- The fix includes modifying error handling within the `SQLAInterface` class in `flask_appbuilder/models/sqla/interface.py` to prevent sensitive information exposure.
- The fix also includes tests to cover the vulnerability and prevent future regressions (`flask_appbuilder/tests/security/test_mvc_security.py`)

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes the fix commit, which modifies error handling to avoid displaying the exception details to the user.
- The CVSS score is 2.7 which indicates a low severity.
- CWE-209 is identified as a related weakness, which relates to improper handling of error messages which may lead to information disclosure.
