- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Cloud Foundry routing release versions from v0.163.0 to v0.283.0, specifically how routes are managed and pruned. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is a lack of proper route management that allows unauthenticated users to force route pruning, which is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) by degrading the availability of the Cloud Foundry deployment. This route pruning can effectively make services inaccessible to users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is unauthenticated network access to the vulnerable Cloud Foundry routing component, allowing a malicious actor to send requests that force route pruning.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the Cloud Foundry routing component to send the malicious requests that trigger the route pruning vulnerability. No authentication is required.
