# The web app does not verify weak password at backend in cloudexplorer-dev/cloudexplorer-lite

Moderate

published
GHSA-px4m-5j22-5mw4
Jun 27, 2023

## Package

maven

com.fit2cloud
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

versions: < 1.2.0

## Patched versions

1.2.0

## Description

### Impact

Weak passwords can be easily guessed and are an easy target for brute force attacks.

This can lead to an authentication system failure and compromise system security.

Access and login to the demo website: <https://cloudexplorer-lite-demo.fit2cloud.com/>

At changing password function, the backend does not verify weak passwords so that user can do:

1. Set new password as same as old password.
2. Set new password by one character, such as 1. This case can bypass frontend check.

Affected versions: <= 1.2.0.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.2.0.

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade the version to v1.2.0.
