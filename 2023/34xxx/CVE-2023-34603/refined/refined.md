Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `${XXX}` in MyBatis within the `org.jeecg.modules.api.controller.SystemApiController.queryFilterTableDictInfo` method. This allows for direct injection of SQL code through user-controlled input, bypassing SQL injection detection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `queryFilterTableDictInfo` method. The vulnerability is triggered by unsanitized user input being directly inserted into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other critical data by crafting malicious SQL queries. This could lead to unauthorized access, identity theft, and other severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `queryFilterTableDictInfo` endpoint.
- URL Parameters: Specifically, the `table`, `text`, `code`, and `filterSql` parameters within the URL are used to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. This could be an external attacker with network access to the application or an internal user with access to send requests.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter names.
- No authentication appears to be required to trigger the vulnerability based on the provided report.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue is located within the `org.jeecg.modules.api.controller.SystemApiController` class, specifically the `queryFilterTableDictInfo` method.
- The vulnerability is due to the direct use of user input in a Mybatis query via `${XXX}` without proper sanitization or prepared statements.
- The following URL demonstrates the vulnerability:
`http://localhost:8080/jeecg-boot/sys/api/queryFilterTableDictInfo?table=sys_user&text=password> as "text", username as "value" from sys_user --&code=username&filterSql=`

**Mitigation:**
The suggested mitigation strategy involves two steps:
1. Implement the fix mentioned in the provided link: <https://my.oschina.net/jeecg/blog/10107636>.
2. Configure a blacklist for sensitive tables and fields using `org\jeecg\common\util\security\AbstractQueryBlackListHandler.java`.
