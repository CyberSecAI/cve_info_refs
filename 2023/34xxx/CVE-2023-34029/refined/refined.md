- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions within the plugin. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link, which then sends a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication. They need to be able to entice a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request.
