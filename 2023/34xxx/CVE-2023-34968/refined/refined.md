1.  **CVE-2023-34968: Spotlight server-side share path disclosure**

    -   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spotlight protocol in Samba discloses the server-side absolute path of shares, files, and directories in search results. The initial request also reveals the server-side path associated with the share.
    -   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure of internal server-side paths
    -   **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of internal server paths can potentially lead to further, more severe attacks, or disclose confidential information.
    -   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the Spotlight protocol in Samba.
    -   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to make a targeted RPC request to a Samba server. No specific user privileges are required.
