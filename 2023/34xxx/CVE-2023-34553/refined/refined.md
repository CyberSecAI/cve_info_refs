- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WAFU Keyless Smart Lock (firmware v1.0) does not implement rolling codes for its remote keyfob commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of rolling code implementation makes the communication susceptible to replay attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can replay captured commands to gain full access to the lock's functions (e.g. arm/disarm).
- **Attack vectors**: Using a software-defined radio, an attacker can capture the commands sent from the remote keyfob to the lock. Subsequently, they can replay those captured commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within radio range of the device and have the technical capability to capture and replay radio signals using a device like a HackRF or a Yardstick One.
