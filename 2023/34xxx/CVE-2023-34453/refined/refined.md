{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow due to unchecked multiplication of input array length with the size of the data type (e.g., 4 for int, 8 for long/double, 2 for short) when creating the output byte array in the `shuffle` methods of `BitShuffle.java`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The integer overflow can lead to a `NegativeArraySizeException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to the allocation of a smaller or negative output byte array.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a large array of primitive types (short, int, long, float, or double) to the `shuffle` methods in the `BitShuffle` class.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the input to the vulnerable methods. No specific privileges or user interaction is required."
