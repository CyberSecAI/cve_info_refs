The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34620.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `hjson-java` library is vulnerable to a stack overflow error due to unbounded recursion when parsing deeply nested JSON structures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded recursion in the `HjsonParser.readObject` and `HjsonParser.readValue` methods while parsing nested objects and values.
- Lack of depth limitation during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack overflow. An attacker can crash the application by providing a specially crafted, deeply nested JSON string as input.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious, deeply nested JSON string as input to the `JsonValue.readHjson()` method, potentially from untrusted sources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the application that is parsed by the vulnerable `hjson-java` library.
- No specific privileges or position is required other than the ability to supply input to the vulnerable parser.

**Additional Information:**
The issue provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrating the vulnerability and suggests two solutions:
  1. Adding a depth variable to track parsing depth and throw an exception when a threshold is exceeded (similar to `jackson-databind`).
  2. Changing recursive processing to stack+iteration based processing (similar to `GSON`).
  - The fix for this vulnerability was included in release 3.0.1.
