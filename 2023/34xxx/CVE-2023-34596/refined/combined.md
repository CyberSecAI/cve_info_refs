### WallMote Quad

### The no-wiring solutions for new, intelligent wall switches

![](https://aeotec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WallMote-Quad-HG.png)

###

### Gentle design

Distinct style. Whether you're in need of a simple switch or something with more capability, there's a WallMote that's right for your installation and the needed aesthetic.

![](https://aeotec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wallmote7_remote.png)
###

### Runs like a remote

They might be installed upon a wall, but you don’t have to install them within a wall. WallMote runs wire free. Its installation doesn’t require a backing box nor mains power. Stick it. Sync it. Use it.

###

### Long live batteries

Wiring makes installing a new switch expensive. Batteries make installing a new WallMote switch cheap. WallMote Quad is powered by a USB-rechargeable lithium battery designed for smartphones.

![wallmote-quad-wall](https://aeotec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wallmote-quad-wall.jpg)

### Install a new switch anywhere in your property easily - no wiring required.

While it looks like a wall switch and operates like a wall switch, what makes WallMote truly powerful is that it is really a remote control. Battery powered, you just need to stick it on a wall or surface to install it. Once synced with your hub, you can control any dimmer, switch or automation routine by using WallMote as you would any other switch.

### Control one thing. Control anything.

Control lights. Control outlets. Control a whole room or a whole property.

It may be styled like a wall switch, but WallMote is much more capable. Once setup with a compatible gateway it can be used to control anything that your gateway can. That ranges from single switches to dimmable light banks, from power outlets to the smart locks that protect your property. And even things that do not utilize the same Z-Wave wireless standard that WallMote does. Smart lighting from Philips Hue? Check. Connected music from Sonos? Easy. If it is connected to your gateway, simply setup WallMote to control any manner of simple or complex routine or automation.

### Stick it. Move it.

Installing WallMote requires no wiring. You can install Wallmote Quad 2upon a wall by simply affixing the mounting plate using the provided, double-sided tape. The mounting plate lets you carry the Wallmote Quad to any place in your home, where you need to be in control. The excellent wireless range of the Wallmote Quad give you the full freedom to control all your Things. Wherever you are.

## 2 switches. 2 looks. WallMote for any wall.
