- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input in the email parameter on the `/forgot_password` page before displaying it back to the user. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Self-reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it back to the user in an error message.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's browser. However, the impact is limited due to the requirement of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The specific impact depends on the context and level of access gained by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a network request to the `/forgot_password` page with a malicious script injected into the "email" parameter of the POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request to the `/forgot_password` page and have a user submit the request to trigger the XSS vulnerability. The attacker does not need any privileges, but requires user interaction.
