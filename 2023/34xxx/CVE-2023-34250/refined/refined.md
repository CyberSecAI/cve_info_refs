- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The new topics dismissal endpoint in Discourse was exposing the number of topics recently created in private categories to unauthorized users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure vulnerability, where the number of recently created topics in private categories, which should not be accessible, is revealed to unprivileged attackers through the new topics dismissal endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can learn the number of topics created in private categories they do not have access to. This leaks sensitive information regarding activity within private categories, although the content of the topics is not exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based and exploitable through the new topics dismissal endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges and no user interaction is required. They only need to access the affected endpoint over the network.
