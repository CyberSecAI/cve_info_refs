Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Mailcow LUA authentication script interacts with Dovecot. The script returns the password in the format `password=pass`. Dovecot parses the return string and interprets key-value pairs after the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The LUA script's method of returning the password, combined with Dovecot's parsing, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary key-value pairs into the response by including spaces in the password.
*   **Insufficient Documentation:** The lack of clear documentation from Dovecot regarding the return values of the `password_verify` function in LUA authentication contributed to the vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Default:** The mailcow default configuration allowed users to change their passwords, making the vulnerability exploitable without requiring elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Manipulation of Dovecot Internal Variables:** Attackers can change Dovecot's internal variables, by crafting a password that includes parameters that are parsed as key=value pairs. The example given is manipulating the `mail_crypt_save_version` to `0`, effectively disabling encryption.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** While most variables are not exploitable, attackers might be able to manipulate other variables that could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** The vulnerability allows bypassing security measures by modifying Dovecotâ€™s behavior.
*   **Potential for other malicious activities:** Successful exploitation could lead to other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Password Modification:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability during the login process by changing the password to a crafted string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account Access:** The attacker needs to have an existing user account that allows password changes. This is enabled by default and not changeable within mailcow.
*   **Knowledge of Dovecot variables:** The attacker needs some knowledge of Dovecot internal variables to leverage the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content includes the fix which removes the return of the actual password from the lua script.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2023-34108
*   CVSS score 8.8/10 High
*   CWE-15 and CWE-639 have been assigned to this vulnerability

In summary, this vulnerability arises from a combination of improper input handling in the Mailcow LUA authentication script and Dovecot's parsing of the returned data, which allows attackers to manipulate Dovecot's internal variables using crafted passwords.
