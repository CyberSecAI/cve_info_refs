As a result of the design of Dovecot LUA auth, lack of Dovecot documentation and a mistake in LUA auth script that is included in Mailcow the attacker can change the internal variables of Dovecot.

## Overviev

The Dovecot can use the LUA script (<https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/lua_based_authentication/>) as a part of the authentication process.
The Mailcow utilize the password\_verify function of this module.
Dovecot documentation does not contain a full explanation of return values for this function.

The Mailcow LUA auth script returns the password in the form of "password=pass" as a return value (as Dovecot documentation describes for auth\_passdb\_lookup function). As a result in case the password contains space, the sequence after the space will be parsed by Dovecot as a key=value sequence.

As a result, the attacker can set the password like "pass mail\_crypt\_save\_version=0". The encryption will be switched off in this example.

Mostly the issue will not affect the server or other users because most of the variables cannot be used by attacker. But in some cases, this can cause the issue.

# Manipulation of Internal Dovecot Variables in mailcow via crafted Passwords

High

[DerLinkman](/DerLinkman)
published
GHSA-mhh4-qchc-pv22
Jun 7, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 2023-05

## Patched versions

>= 2023-05a

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been discovered in mailcow. The vulnerability, allows an attacker to manipulate internal Dovecot variables by using specially crafted passwords during the authentication process.

The issue arises from the behavior of the passwd-verify.lua script, which is responsible during login. Upon a successful login, the script returns a response in the format of "password=", indicating the successful authentication.

By crafting a password with additional key-value pairs appended to it, an attacker can manipulate the returned string and influence the internal behavior of Dovecot. For example, using the password "123 mail\_crypt\_save\_version=0" would cause the passwd-verify.lua script to return the string "password=123 mail\_crypt\_save\_version=0". Consequently, Dovecot will interpret this string and set the internal variables accordingly, leading to unintended consequences.

By changing the password to a specific payload, the vulnerability can be exploited during the login process using the special-crafted password. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing security controls, or other malicious activities.

### Patches

Versions including 2023-05a and later

### Workarounds

There is **NO workaround** ! This exploit can be used by any user who can change their password (enabled by default and not changeable within mailcow).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
