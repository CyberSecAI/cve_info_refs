Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-34761

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the 7-Eleven LED Message Cup application implements a chat censor filter on the client-side (within the mobile app) rather than on the server-side. This means that an attacker can bypass this filter by modifying the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application does not properly control access to the message filtering logic, allowing it to be modified.
*   **Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security (CWE-602):** The application relies on client-side code to enforce security policies, making it susceptible to tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass the chat censor filter and display unfiltered messages on the LED cup. This could be used to display offensive or inappropriate content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) range of the LED message cup.
*   **Modified mobile application:** The attacker uses a modified version of the official "Hello Cup" Android application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Technical expertise:** The attacker needs to be able to decompile, modify, and recompile Android applications, specifically using tools like JADX-GUI and APK Easy Tool to access and modify the application's smali code.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within BLE range of the target cup to connect and send modified messages.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No prior authentication or special authorization is required to connect to the cup via BLE and send messages.
