# Out-of-bounds read when processing ICMP DAO input

High

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-fp66-ff6x-7w2w
Jun 14, 2023

## Package

os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-icmp6.c

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

When processing ICMP DAO packets in the dao\_input\_storing function, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that the packet buffer is big enough to contain the bytes it needs before accessing them.

Up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds in the dao\_input\_storing function:

679: instance\_id = buffer[pos++];

685: flags = buffer[pos++];

688: sequence = buffer[pos++];

695: memcmp(&dag->dag\_id, &buffer[pos], sizeof(dag->dag\_id))

An attacker can truncate an ICMP packet so that it does not contain enough data, leading to an out-of-bounds read on these lines.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request [#2435](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2435) to patch the system.
