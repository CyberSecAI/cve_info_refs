Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The mjson library is vulnerable to a stack overflow error due to its recursive parsing implementation when processing deeply nested JSON arrays.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Recursive parsing:** The `mjson.Json$Reader` uses recursive calls to `readArray` and `read` when parsing nested JSON arrays, which can lead to a stack overflow.
- **Lack of depth limit:** The parser does not enforce a limit on the nesting depth of JSON arrays, allowing an attacker to provide input that will cause the parser to exhaust the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application using mjson to crash by providing a specially crafted JSON string with excessive nesting. This can lead to service unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Untrusted JSON input:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `mjson.Json.read()` method is used to parse a user-supplied JSON string, with excessive nesting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the JSON string to be parsed by the mjson library. This could be via a network request, file upload, or other means of user input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The suggested rectification solutions are:
    1. Add a depth variable to record parsing depth, throwing an exception if a certain threshold is exceeded
    2. Change recursive parsing to an iterative stack-based approach.
- The issue is marked as fixed in version 1.4.2, but there's no public release for it.
