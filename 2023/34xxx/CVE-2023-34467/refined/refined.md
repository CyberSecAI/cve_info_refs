Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the email obfuscation configuration in XWiki was not fully applied. While the email address displayed to the end-user was obfuscated in the frontend, the full, unobfuscated email address was still present in the server's response. Additionally, users could filter and sort on the unobfuscated email addresses, further revealing the complete email.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The system failed to properly restrict access to sensitive email data, allowing unauthorized retrieval.
*   **Data Leakage:** The full email addresses of users were exposed, despite the intended obfuscation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could retrieve the full email addresses of all users on the platform, even when email obfuscation was enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific GET request to the `/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/UserDirectoryLivetableResults` endpoint.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected XWiki instance.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by a user named `floerer` through Intigriti.
*   The issue is tracked in XWiki's Jira as [XWIKI-20333](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20333).
*   The vulnerability is patched in XWiki versions 14.10.4, 14.4.8, and 15.0-rc-1.
