#### Description

**SUBMISSION REFERENCES**

* **Submission code**: XWIKI-7B910O3J
* **Submission URL**: <https://www.intigriti.com/auth/dashboard?redirect=/submissions/e95a7ad5-7029-4627-abf0-3e3e3ea0b4ce/XWIKI-7B910O3J>

**RESEARCHER INFORMATION**

* **Submitter**: floerer

**SUBMISSION INFORMATION**

* **Created at**: Thu, 03 Nov 2022 07:48:27 GMT
* **Submission status**: Archived

**REPORT CONTENT**

* **Severity**: High (7.5)
* **Domain**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/> (Url)
* **Proof of concept**: According to the out-of-scope section all the user data is public except for the email and password, however it is possible to retrieve the email address of other users.

\***Steps to reproduce**\*

1. Go to <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/UserDirectoryLivetableResults?outputSyntax=plain&transprefix=xe.userdirectory.&classname=XWiki.XWikiUsers&collist=_avatar%2Cdoc.name%2Cfirst_name%2Clast_name%2Cemail%2Cactive&queryFilters=currentlanguage%2Chidden&&hideDisabledProfiles=true&offset=1&limit=10&reqNo=1&sort=doc.name&dir=asc>

2. Now you will see the list of users, you can search for `floerer@intigriti.me` and see that my email address is there, only the short version `f....@intigriti.me` is shown in the frontend but via the endpoint the full address can be retrieved

* **Impact**: Retrieve full email addresses of all the users on the platform.
* **Personal data involved**: No
* **Endpoint**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/UserDirectoryLivetableResults?outputSyntax=plain&transprefix=xe.userdirectory.&classname=XWiki.XWikiUsers&collist=_avatar%2Cdoc.name%2Cfirst_name%2Clast_name%2Cemail%2Cactive&queryFilters=currentlanguage%2Chidden&&hideDisabledProfiles=true&offset=1&limit=10&reqNo=1&sort=doc.name&dir=asc>
* **Type**: Improper Access Control
* **Attachments**: No attachments available

# Retrieve email addresses of all users

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-livetable-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 3.5-milestone-1

## Patched versions

15.0-rc-1, 14.4.8, 14.10.4

## Description

### Impact

The mail obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account and while the mail displayed to the end user was obfuscated:

* the rest response was also containing the mail unobfuscated
* user were able to filter and sort on the unobfuscated (allowing to infer the mail content)

The consequence was the possibility to retrieve the email addresses of all users even when obfuscated.

See <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20333> for the reproduction steps.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4, XWiki 14.4.8, and XWiki 15.0-rc-1.

### Workarounds

The workaround is to modify the page `XWiki.LiveTableResultsMacros` following this [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/71f889db9962df2d385f4298e29cfbc9050b828a#diff-5a739e5865b1f1ad9d79b724791be51b0095a0170cc078911c940478b13b949a).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
