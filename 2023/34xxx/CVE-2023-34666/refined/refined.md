The provided content details a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cyber Cafe Management System Project (CCMS) 1.0.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the admin username field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected script is stored and executed every time a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code. This allows them to potentially:
* Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user.
* Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the admin panel of the application, specifically by modifying the admin username.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker requires access to the admin panel of the vulnerable application.
* The attacker must be able to modify the admin username.
