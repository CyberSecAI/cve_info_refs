The provided content relates to CVE-2023-34454.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `compress` methods when calculating the required buffer size for compression of char, double, float, int, long, and short arrays. The multiplication of the input array length by the size of the data type (e.g., 2 for char, 8 for double) can result in an integer overflow, leading to a negative value. This negative value is then used to allocate a byte array which throws a `NegativeArraySizeException` or leads to an access violation in native code due to a small buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
- Unchecked multiplication before allocating a buffer in `compress` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application due to `NegativeArraySizeException` or access violation error.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `compress` methods with large arrays of type char, double, float, int, long, or short, leading to an integer overflow when calculating buffer size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the input data to the vulnerable `compress` method. No special privileges or user interaction are needed.
