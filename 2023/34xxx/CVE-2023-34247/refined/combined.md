### @dcousens **[dcousens](/dcousens)** commented [Jun 13, 2023](#issue-1754240127)

Thanks to [@scgajge12](https://github.com/scgajge12) for reporting [GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m "GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m"), for now there is no straight forward resolution.

It is my understanding that the best approach we could take here would be to only allow redirecting to routes accepted by the AdminUI, but that functionality did not appear to be easy to implement quickly.

Although this is a breaking change, I have opted to mark this as a `patch`, as users will likely prefer the security resolution in a patch compared to an upgrade.

[@borisno2](https://github.com/borisno2) and I intend to fix this in newer versions of this package.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This would be the preferred approach that we would want for the AdminUI, to be honest

`sudoContext.query[listKey]` will always exist, if we use `listKey`, as checked by `throwIfInvalidConfig`

# Open redirect in @keystone-6/auth

Low

Jun 13, 2023

## Package

npm

@keystone-6/auth
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<7.0.0,7.0.0

## Patched versions

>=7.0.1

## Description

### Summary

There is an open redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package, where the redirect leading `/` filter can be bypassed.

### Impact

Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location.

### Mitigations

* Don't use the `@keystone-6/auth` package

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
