## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;

* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

## How to use the best vulnerability alert service?

##### Register

Start your free-forever Vulmon Alerts membership. Registration form is [here](/register).

##### Subscribe

Add your vulnerability queries to the query list on your dashboard, and activate it.

##### Alerted

Get notified with daily emails, instant Slack messages, and API when your queries hit newly
published vulnerabilities.

### Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks. Weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning routines cause long latencies on vulnerability identification. Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners. Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes. [Get Started](/register)

### Vulnerability Alert Subscriptions

Get notifications about
vulnerabilities in your software stack before they are exploited

![Vulmon Alerts Search Engine Query Subscriptions](/imgs/img/search_engine-2.png)

#### Search Engine Query Subscriptions

It is the fastest way to get notified of newly
published vulnerabilities that are of interest to you.

You can subscribe to any query, including (but
not limited to) vendors, products, vulnerability types, researchers, or a combination of
queries.

When your subscribed queries hit a new
vulnerability, you will get daily emails. If daily emails are not enough for you, other options
include instant Slack notifications, RSS feeds, and API access.

[Try it free...](/register)

#### Strict Query Subscriptions

It is the best way to get notified about newly
published vulnerabilities if you want to define your subscription strictly based on vendors,
products, and CVSS scores

When your subscribed queries hit a new
vulnerability, you will get daily emails. If daily emails are not enough for you, other options
include instant Slack notifications, RSS feeds, and API access.

#### Daily Vulnerability Trends

Thousands of vulnerabilities are published every year, but few of them attract the attention
of cybersecurity researchers.
The Daily Vulnerability Trends feature informs you of the vulnerabilities being discussed in
the cybersecurity community.

Daily vulnerability trends keep you up to date on the most significant vulnerabilities. This
daily information aids
in your decision-making process on vulnerability assessment and on more strategic decisions,
like product procurement.

## Hey there!

Hi, I'm Galoget Latorre (a.k.a. galoget) and I'm a Cybersecurity lover from Ecuador. In my free time I code some Hacking Tools and also participate in CTFs as a hobby.
My team is [hackem](https://ctftime.org/team/52403) or when the competitions are individual my nick is **galoget**.

## [Cracking Passwords: Brute-force Attack with Hydra (CLI) + xHydra (GTK)](https://galogetlatorre.blogspot.com/2018/01/cracking-passwords-brute-force-thc-hydra-xhydra-gtk.html)

7:32 AM
[1 comment](https://galogetlatorre.blogspot.com/2018/01/cracking-passwords-brute-force-thc-hydra-xhydra-gtk.html#comment-form)

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIsj81a4LIAWFYQW9HY_bEilk7OwtNAX2IchCc3AMjiuFQhSaSr4whQ2Kqk5Qnkrw2XQQMNxkKKcXwkSDQ1CFdSc521ksb3JqdWusv6uKuLsjYKrLTeKNwq28qt90UMivhtyXI2_EsHdc_/s400/hydra-bruteforce.jpg)

Recently on [Security StackExchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/), I saw a lot of people asking how to use properly THC Hydra for Password Cracking, so in this post I'm going to explain how to install the command line utility, and also how to install the graphical user interface (GUI) for it. Then you can find step by step instructions on how to use this tool properly to attack an `http-form-post`that simulates a Login form for a corporate website. Hope you enjoy this post as much as I did when I was writing it.

### Demo

[![CVE-2023-34096 exploit PoC](/galoget/Thruk-CVE-2023-34096/raw/main/CVE-2023-34096-exploit-PoC.png "CVE-2023-34096 exploit PoC")](/galoget/Thruk-CVE-2023-34096/blob/main/CVE-2023-34096-exploit-PoC.png)

**Note:** In the previous image, you can see that the exploit is showing an error message for the last 3 attempts, this is because in the test environment some folders were non-existent or the Apache user did not have write permissions on those paths. The exploit works correctly and the output was intended to test all possible cases.

### Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks. Weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning routines cause long latencies on vulnerability identification. Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners. Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes. [Get Started](/register)

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

* With this Blog, I want to meet more experts in Cyber Security and InfoSec and also a Blog is a good way to organize your ideas, to stay active or knowledgeable in a field.
* A good friend and also Security Expert said in an Interview "*Don't be like everyone else. Try to work not for the money, but for the idea. It's necessary to continually be exploring and doing all that you can to become a true expert and the one who can solve almost all tasks, even if they are brand new*." -Dmitry Bestuzhev [Kaspersky Lab]
* Another good friend and also Security Expert said in a Conference "*All you need is a passion for change and an energy to effect that change*" -Fabio Assolini [Kaspersky Lab]
* These words inspired me a lot, so I decided to take part and with this blog I am looking for passioned people in Cybersecurity, people that want to participate, that don't want to be like everyone else, that don't works only for money and that wants to help other people.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Important Note:** All of the findings listed here were previously reported to the manufacturer of the software.

As part of the responsible disclosure policy, we waited for a response of the manufacturer (confirming the vulnerability, issuing a patch, or accepting that they won't solve the finding) before sharing this post.

### **Introduction**

During a Penetration Test performed to a Security Company I was able to identify certain findings that could affect the popular **Thruk Monitoring Web Interface**. So, after analyzing the **GitHub** repository and performing some tests on the target environment, I was able to **identify** and **exploit** the vulnerabilities, then I reported these issues to the manufacturer.

### **Summary**

The file **panorama.pm** is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Vulnerability which allows a remote authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. This vulnerability affects all versions of **Thruk** even the one that was recently published (**<=3.06**) in **May 24, 2023**.

### **Details**

The parameter "**location**" is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (**.**) and the slash (**/**).

This was verified by analyzing in detail the **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sni/Thruk)** and the source files.

In this step, the **location** is received from the parameters sent by the client through the web request and there is no sanitization at all.

Then, the variable **folder** is constructed doing a basic concatenation without any sanitization.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEhaWWgppdNJxbVZQAwTJRcgQ9eBBKRX05AinEp3a9_JBQ7X2D0os6WtnybZCfY0oTDFtdtGYzZuLhaXBR8h6Ju1JXkoIWsr0x5jnoAG7GoHRMJFCFGFbepVytKjnPZUQ6Wo_ESdcYiZt-su4WT8dn00jTk-qb7MnSJuFom5mWxwvC0NDj57UPq3xdBQ/w581-h80/folder-variable-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L705)

Next, the **folder** variable is concatenated with the **filename** and its result is stored in the **newlocation** variable, again no sanitization at all.

Finally, here the uploaded file is moved to the desired folder.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOoy2xHPUi9_FzJqHnhnWC35wizBWUvTHMSaFH-fJJBCJ1fOnkoPRlSaoUwtgL2NL8WB5qud2dvzCszjB-uabikk_TC6VVv8SkeuhY1W8-fqm6OHKch67iGHbFI-1f8sCLg39ixNKRp042t3uNOznChNq8CoxYC1KYPFzFe0fAmy5zXMM3uPsC4aJWIA/w593-h83/move-file-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735)

Through this flow, it is easy to see that due to the lack of sanitization we can manipulate the **location** parameter and exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability to upload a file to any folder we want.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. Go to the form where we can upload an image that will be used as background for a Dashboard.
2. Select any file with the allowed extensions and intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Modify the location parameter which is the **backgrounds/** string and replace it with something like **backgrounds/../../../../tmp/**
4. You will receive a message that the file was uploaded successfully.
5. Check your **/tmp/** folder and verify the presence of the file.

As part of the PoC, I decided to include the following screenshots.

#### **Normal Case**

In this first screenshot I included the normal request where a file will be uploaded to a folder where the current user does not have any write permissions, and I received an error message.

#### **Path Traversal Exploitation**

In this second screenshot I included the manipulated request where the path traversal vulnerability is being exploited to upload the file to **/tmp/** folder, as you can see I received a success message.

### **CVSS**

The NIST NVD assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **8.8 (High)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**
The CNA GitHub, Inc. assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **6.5 (Medium)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N**
Check [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34096) for further details.
### **Impact**

A Path Traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. The attacker can overwrite existing files on the system and cause a defacement (replacing legitimate images on the web server) or simply can upload random files to fill the disk completely and affect the availability and correct status of the platform.

It is well known that a Path Traversal Vulnerability in certain cases can allow an attacker to upload a webshell and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected host, which could lead to a Complete System Takeover.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was published 15 days ago (3.06) in May 24, 2023;so the impact is bigger as this issue affects all instances of Thruk around the world.

This was reported through a **Security Advisory** via **GitHub**. You can find the security advisory report and other useful references in the following links:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [CVE-2023-34096: Path Traversal Vulnerability in Thruk Monitoring Web Interface](https://galogetlatorre.blogspot.com/2023/06/cve-2023-34096-path-traversal-thruk.html)

[No comments](https://galogetlatorre.blogspot.com/2023/06/cve-2023-34096-path-traversal-thruk.html#comment-form)

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsGAFRLk_abgVZtaiowbTpZwtXoelpHVjYANWBXZcaUcslIT1oLclwZoo8kge96F4GBfMMknXu769DZnRPBgFYFTd_dULOLu88MtQJV1vOmbPtTBFJVwLTQcrGv0QPLfwU3PmjMd7m5S5TnOMBhtZCuYlJJRyPLEqCTsj9BkMsQrSrzDf_AFdMevH6Sg/s320/Thruk-Logo.png)

**Important Note:** All of the findings listed here were previously reported to the manufacturer of the software.

As part of the responsible disclosure policy, we waited for a response of the manufacturer (confirming the vulnerability, issuing a patch, or accepting that they won't solve the finding) before sharing this post.

### **Introduction**

During a Penetration Test performed to a Security Company I was able to identify certain findings that could affect the popular **Thruk Monitoring Web Interface**. So, after analyzing the **GitHub** repository and performing some tests on the target environment, I was able to **identify** and **exploit** the vulnerabilities, then I reported these issues to the manufacturer.

### **Summary**

The file **panorama.pm** is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Vulnerability which allows a remote authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. This vulnerability affects all versions of **Thruk** even the one that was recently published (**<=3.06**) in **May 24, 2023**.

### **Details**

The parameter "**location**" is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (**.**) and the slash (**/**).

This was verified by analyzing in detail the **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sni/Thruk)** and the source files.

In this step, the **location** is received from the parameters sent by the client through the web request and there is no sanitization at all.

Then, the variable **folder** is constructed doing a basic concatenation without any sanitization.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEhaWWgppdNJxbVZQAwTJRcgQ9eBBKRX05AinEp3a9_JBQ7X2D0os6WtnybZCfY0oTDFtdtGYzZuLhaXBR8h6Ju1JXkoIWsr0x5jnoAG7GoHRMJFCFGFbepVytKjnPZUQ6Wo_ESdcYiZt-su4WT8dn00jTk-qb7MnSJuFom5mWxwvC0NDj57UPq3xdBQ/w581-h80/folder-variable-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L705)

Next, the **folder** variable is concatenated with the **filename** and its result is stored in the **newlocation** variable, again no sanitization at all.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyTnV0c5mPv-YhQ6hbyK6jTZKCEgP8_4ZXLNlM9Zm4y0RUv4Z4YZzgVHPGVbQiDlfnfQclUGt_ucdRFCStt8w6pMWFGrlT7waLoVdbiUAudQpt4ioAus4sghNsXQJH8sGLb78erzOmJAFGcP_F_PewtZKLEvYoyjDSsQpEbz3VYSOkGpffVpuCjAGIBA/w589-h84/newlocation-variable-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L727)

Finally, here the uploaded file is moved to the desired folder.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOoy2xHPUi9_FzJqHnhnWC35wizBWUvTHMSaFH-fJJBCJ1fOnkoPRlSaoUwtgL2NL8WB5qud2dvzCszjB-uabikk_TC6VVv8SkeuhY1W8-fqm6OHKch67iGHbFI-1f8sCLg39ixNKRp042t3uNOznChNq8CoxYC1KYPFzFe0fAmy5zXMM3uPsC4aJWIA/w593-h83/move-file-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735)

Through this flow, it is easy to see that due to the lack of sanitization we can manipulate the **location** parameter and exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability to upload a file to any folder we want.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. Go to the form where we can upload an image that will be used as background for a Dashboard.
2. Select any file with the allowed extensions and intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Modify the location parameter which is the **backgrounds/** string and replace it with something like **backgrounds/../../../../tmp/**
4. You will receive a message that the file was uploaded successfully.
5. Check your **/tmp/** folder and verify the presence of the file.

As part of the PoC, I decided to include the following screenshots.

#### **Normal Case**

In this first screenshot I included the normal request where a file will be uploaded to a folder where the current user does not have any write permissions, and I received an error message.

#### **Path Traversal Exploitation**

In this second screenshot I included the manipulated request where the path traversal vulnerability is being exploited to upload the file to **/tmp/** folder, as you can see I received a success message.

### **CVSS**

The NIST NVD assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **8.8 (High)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**
The CNA GitHub, Inc. assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **6.5 (Medium)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N**
Check [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34096) for further details.
### **Impact**

A Path Traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. The attacker can overwrite existing files on the system and cause a defacement (replacing legitimate images on the web server) or simply can upload random files to fill the disk completely and affect the availability and correct status of the platform.

It is well known that a Path Traversal Vulnerability in certain cases can allow an attacker to upload a webshell and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected host, which could lead to a Complete System Takeover.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was published 15 days ago (3.06) in May 24, 2023;so the impact is bigger as this issue affects all instances of Thruk around the world.

This was reported through a **Security Advisory** via **GitHub**. You can find the security advisory report and other useful references in the following links:

Recently on [Security StackExchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/), I saw a lot of people asking how to use properly THC Hydra for Password Cracking, so in this post I'm going to explain how to install the command line utility, and also how to install the graphical user interface (GUI) for it. Then you can find step by step instructions on how to use this tool properly to attack an `http-form-post`that simulates a Login form for a corporate website. Hope you enjoy this post as much as I did when I was writing it.

A few days ago, we received an invitation to the BlitzCTF001, a very short and fast cybersecurity CTF. The challenges contained in this CTF covers: Crypto (Encoding), SQLi, Broken Access Control, Session Manipulation and Steganography.

In our opinion, the challenges are interesting and entertaining, especially to learn about web application security, so we decided to share the solutions (just in case that you got stuck in some level), hope you like and enjoy them as we did.

A password (commonly knows as **passwd** in linux) is an unspaced sequence of characters used to determine that a computer user requesting access to a computer system is really that particular user. Typically, users of a multiuser or securely protected single-user system claim a unique name (called a user ID) that can be generally known. In order to verify that someone entering that user ID really is that person, a second identification, the password, known only to that person and to the system itself, is entered by the user. Most networks require that end users change their passwords on a periodic basis.

**passwd command**

In this post I am going to talk about a new tool: "Adobe Malware Classifier", this is a command-line tool that lets antivirus analysts, IT administrators, and security researchers quickly and easily determine if a binary file contains malware, so they can develop malware detection signatures faster, reducing the time in which users' systems are vulnerable.

Nowadays a common problem for many companies is Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS), so in this post is explained: what is a DDoS and a possible solution for it?

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):**
In computing, this attack is an attempt to make a machine (usually a web server) or a network resource unavaliable to its intended users, the reasons for this attack may vary, but it generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet, a visual explanation is shown in Figure 1.

## Vulnerability Summary

Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently supports Naemon, Icinga, Shinken and Nagios as backends. In versions 3.06 and prior, the file `panorama.pm` is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability which allows an malicious user to upload a file to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. The parameter location is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (`.`) and the slash (`/`). A fix is available in version 3.06.2.

**Important Note:** All of the findings listed here were previously reported to the manufacturer of the software.

As part of the responsible disclosure policy, we waited for a response of the manufacturer (confirming the vulnerability, issuing a patch, or accepting that they won't solve the finding) before sharing this post.

### **Introduction**

During a Penetration Test performed to a Security Company I was able to identify certain findings that could affect the popular **Thruk Monitoring Web Interface**. So, after analyzing the **GitHub** repository and performing some tests on the target environment, I was able to **identify** and **exploit** the vulnerabilities, then I reported these issues to the manufacturer.

### **Summary**

The file **panorama.pm** is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Vulnerability which allows a remote authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. This vulnerability affects all versions of **Thruk** even the one that was recently published (**<=3.06**) in **May 24, 2023**.

### **Details**

The parameter "**location**" is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (**.**) and the slash (**/**).

This was verified by analyzing in detail the **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sni/Thruk)** and the source files.

In this step, the **location** is received from the parameters sent by the client through the web request and there is no sanitization at all.

Then, the variable **folder** is constructed doing a basic concatenation without any sanitization.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEhaWWgppdNJxbVZQAwTJRcgQ9eBBKRX05AinEp3a9_JBQ7X2D0os6WtnybZCfY0oTDFtdtGYzZuLhaXBR8h6Ju1JXkoIWsr0x5jnoAG7GoHRMJFCFGFbepVytKjnPZUQ6Wo_ESdcYiZt-su4WT8dn00jTk-qb7MnSJuFom5mWxwvC0NDj57UPq3xdBQ/w581-h80/folder-variable-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L705)

Next, the **folder** variable is concatenated with the **filename** and its result is stored in the **newlocation** variable, again no sanitization at all.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyTnV0c5mPv-YhQ6hbyK6jTZKCEgP8_4ZXLNlM9Zm4y0RUv4Z4YZzgVHPGVbQiDlfnfQclUGt_ucdRFCStt8w6pMWFGrlT7waLoVdbiUAudQpt4ioAus4sghNsXQJH8sGLb78erzOmJAFGcP_F_PewtZKLEvYoyjDSsQpEbz3VYSOkGpffVpuCjAGIBA/w589-h84/newlocation-variable-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L727)

Finally, here the uploaded file is moved to the desired folder.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOoy2xHPUi9_FzJqHnhnWC35wizBWUvTHMSaFH-fJJBCJ1fOnkoPRlSaoUwtgL2NL8WB5qud2dvzCszjB-uabikk_TC6VVv8SkeuhY1W8-fqm6OHKch67iGHbFI-1f8sCLg39ixNKRp042t3uNOznChNq8CoxYC1KYPFzFe0fAmy5zXMM3uPsC4aJWIA/w593-h83/move-file-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735)

Through this flow, it is easy to see that due to the lack of sanitization we can manipulate the **location** parameter and exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability to upload a file to any folder we want.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. Go to the form where we can upload an image that will be used as background for a Dashboard.
2. Select any file with the allowed extensions and intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Modify the location parameter which is the **backgrounds/** string and replace it with something like **backgrounds/../../../../tmp/**
4. You will receive a message that the file was uploaded successfully.
5. Check your **/tmp/** folder and verify the presence of the file.

As part of the PoC, I decided to include the following screenshots.

#### **Normal Case**

In this first screenshot I included the normal request where a file will be uploaded to a folder where the current user does not have any write permissions, and I received an error message.

#### **Path Traversal Exploitation**

In this second screenshot I included the manipulated request where the path traversal vulnerability is being exploited to upload the file to **/tmp/** folder, as you can see I received a success message.

### **CVSS**

The NIST NVD assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **8.8 (High)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**
The CNA GitHub, Inc. assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **6.5 (Medium)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N**
Check [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34096) for further details.
### **Impact**

A Path Traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. The attacker can overwrite existing files on the system and cause a defacement (replacing legitimate images on the web server) or simply can upload random files to fill the disk completely and affect the availability and correct status of the platform.

It is well known that a Path Traversal Vulnerability in certain cases can allow an attacker to upload a webshell and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected host, which could lead to a Complete System Takeover.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was published 15 days ago (3.06) in May 24, 2023;so the impact is bigger as this issue affects all instances of Thruk around the world.

This was reported through a **Security Advisory** via **GitHub**. You can find the security advisory report and other useful references in the following links:

# Path Traversal Vulnerability in panorama.pm

Moderate

[sni](/sni)
published
GHSA-vhqc-649h-994h
Jun 8, 2023

## Package

panorama.pm
(Perl)

## Affected versions

<= 3.06

## Patched versions

3.06-2

## Description

### Summary

The file `panorama.pm` is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Vulnerability which allows a remote authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was recently published (<=3.06).

### Details

The parameter location is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (`.`) and the slash (`/`).

In this step, the `location` is received from the parameters sent by the client through the web request and there is no sanitization at all.

[Thruk/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L690)

Line 690
in
[1bc5a58](/sni/Thruk/commit/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867)

|  | my $location = $c->req->parameters->{'location'}; |
| --- | --- |

Then, the variable `folder` is constructed doing a basic concatenation without any sanitization.

[Thruk/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L705)

Line 705
in
[1bc5a58](/sni/Thruk/commit/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867)

|  | my $folder = $c->stash->{'usercontent\_folder'}.'/'.$location; |
| --- | --- |

Next, the `folder` variable is concatenated with the `filename` variable and its result is stored in the `newlocation` variable, again no sanitization at all.

[Thruk/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L727)

Line 727
in
[1bc5a58](/sni/Thruk/commit/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867)

|  | my $newlocation = $folder.'/'.$filename; |
| --- | --- |

Finally, here the uploaded file is moved to the desired folder.

[Thruk/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735)

Line 735
in
[1bc5a58](/sni/Thruk/commit/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867)

|  | move($upload->{'tempname'}, $newlocation); |
| --- | --- |

Through this flow, it is easy to see that due to the lack of sanitization we can manipulate the location parameter and exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability to upload a file to any folder we want.

### PoC

1. Go to the form where we can upload an image that will be used as background for a Dashboard.
2. Select any file with the allowed extensions and intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Modify the `location` parameter which is the `backgrounds/` string and replace it with something like `backgrounds/../../../../tmp/`
4. You will receive a message that the file was uploaded successfully.
5. Check your `/tmp/` folder and verify the presence of the file.

As part of the PoC, I decided to include the following screenshots.

In the first screenshot I included the normal request where a file will be uploaded to a folder where the current user does not have any write permissions, and I received an error message.

[![1 Thruk-Normal-Behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8353133/243420052-851a03c5-1b18-44b0-88ab-af1ba2e122b4.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8353133/243420052-851a03c5-1b18-44b0-88ab-af1ba2e122b4.png)

In the second screenshot I included the manipulated request where the path traversal vulnerability is being exploited to upload the file to `/tmp/` folder, as you can see I received a success message.

[![2 Thruk-Path-Traversal-Exploitation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8353133/243420096-a5ff7962-3f03-47cd-8144-6cd0f6ff9f71.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8353133/243420096-a5ff7962-3f03-47cd-8144-6cd0f6ff9f71.png)

### Impact

A Path Traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. The attacker can overwrite existing files on the system and cause a defacement (replacing legitimate images on the web server) or simply can upload random files to fill the disk completely and affect the availability and correct status of the platform.

It is well known that a Path Traversal Vulnerability in certain cases can allow an attacker to upload a webshell and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected host, which could lead to a Complete System Takeover.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was recently published (3.06) so the impact is bigger as this issue affects all instances of Thruk around the world.

**Important Note:** All of the findings listed here were previously reported to the manufacturer of the software.

As part of the responsible disclosure policy, we waited for a response of the manufacturer (confirming the vulnerability, issuing a patch, or accepting that they won't solve the finding) before sharing this post.

### **Introduction**

During a Penetration Test performed to a Security Company I was able to identify certain findings that could affect the popular **Thruk Monitoring Web Interface**. So, after analyzing the **GitHub** repository and performing some tests on the target environment, I was able to **identify** and **exploit** the vulnerabilities, then I reported these issues to the manufacturer.

### **Summary**

The file **panorama.pm** is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Vulnerability which allows a remote authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. This vulnerability affects all versions of **Thruk** even the one that was recently published (**<=3.06**) in **May 24, 2023**.

### **Details**

The parameter "**location**" is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (**.**) and the slash (**/**).

This was verified by analyzing in detail the **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sni/Thruk)** and the source files.

In this step, the **location** is received from the parameters sent by the client through the web request and there is no sanitization at all.

Then, the variable **folder** is constructed doing a basic concatenation without any sanitization.

Next, the **folder** variable is concatenated with the **filename** and its result is stored in the **newlocation** variable, again no sanitization at all.

Finally, here the uploaded file is moved to the desired folder.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOoy2xHPUi9_FzJqHnhnWC35wizBWUvTHMSaFH-fJJBCJ1fOnkoPRlSaoUwtgL2NL8WB5qud2dvzCszjB-uabikk_TC6VVv8SkeuhY1W8-fqm6OHKch67iGHbFI-1f8sCLg39ixNKRp042t3uNOznChNq8CoxYC1KYPFzFe0fAmy5zXMM3uPsC4aJWIA/w593-h83/move-file-no-sanitization.png)](https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735)

Through this flow, it is easy to see that due to the lack of sanitization we can manipulate the **location** parameter and exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability to upload a file to any folder we want.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. Go to the form where we can upload an image that will be used as background for a Dashboard.
2. Select any file with the allowed extensions and intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Modify the location parameter which is the **backgrounds/** string and replace it with something like **backgrounds/../../../../tmp/**
4. You will receive a message that the file was uploaded successfully.
5. Check your **/tmp/** folder and verify the presence of the file.

As part of the PoC, I decided to include the following screenshots.

#### **Normal Case**

In this first screenshot I included the normal request where a file will be uploaded to a folder where the current user does not have any write permissions, and I received an error message.

#### **Path Traversal Exploitation**

In this second screenshot I included the manipulated request where the path traversal vulnerability is being exploited to upload the file to **/tmp/** folder, as you can see I received a success message.

### **CVSS**

The NIST NVD assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **8.8 (High)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**
The CNA GitHub, Inc. assigned a **CVSS 3.1** Score of **6.5 (Medium)** to this vulnerability.
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N**
Check [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34096) for further details.
### **Impact**

A Path Traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. The attacker can overwrite existing files on the system and cause a defacement (replacing legitimate images on the web server) or simply can upload random files to fill the disk completely and affect the availability and correct status of the platform.

It is well known that a Path Traversal Vulnerability in certain cases can allow an attacker to upload a webshell and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected host, which could lead to a Complete System Takeover.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Thruk even the one that was published 15 days ago (3.06) in May 24, 2023;so the impact is bigger as this issue affects all instances of Thruk around the world.

This was reported through a **Security Advisory** via **GitHub**. You can find the security advisory report and other useful references in the following links:
