# Out-of-bounds read when processing TCP MSS option

High

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-3v7c-jq9x-cmph
Jun 9, 2023

## Package

os/net/ipv6/uip6.c

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

When reading the TCP MSS option value from an incoming packet, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that

certain buffer indices to read from are within the bounds of the IPv6 packet buffer, uip\_buf. In particular, there is a 2-byte buffer read in the corresponding code in the module os/net/ipv6/uip6.c:

tmp16 = ((uint16\_t)uip\_buf[UIP\_IPTCPH\_LEN + 2 + c] << 8) | (uint16\_t)uip\_buf[UIP\_IPTCPH\_LEN + 3 + c];

The buffer is indexed using 'UIP\_IPTCPH\_LEN + 2 + c' and 'UIP\_IPTCPH\_LEN + 3 + c', but the uip\_buf buffer may not have enough data, resulting in a 2-byte read out of bounds.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes made in Contiki-NG pull request [#2434](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2434) to patch the problem.
