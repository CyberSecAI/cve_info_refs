The provided content describes multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in Bludit, a web application. Here's a breakdown of each:

**Issue #1369**

*   **Root cause:**  The application includes data from an untrusted source (user input) within later HTTP responses in an unsafe way. Specifically, the application allows a user to insert arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags, into a page's content via the "Source code" editor of the "New content" feature.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser session. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the "New content" page and "Source code" editor.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify content.

**Issue #1508**

*   **Root cause:** The application doesn't properly sanitize SVG files uploaded as images, allowing an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript or SSRF payloads.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and potentially Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), although the SSRF part is not detailed in the description.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Similar to Issue #1369, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser by uploading a malicious SVG file. The SSRF vulnerability could allow the attacker to make requests from the server, potentially accessing internal resources.
*   **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious SVG file via the image upload functionality within the "New content" creation page.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with the ability to upload images on the "New content" page.

**Issue #1212**

*   **Root cause:** The application's logo upload functionality only checks the file extension, but not the content, allowing users to upload SVG files containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could upload a malicious SVG file as a logo and execute arbitrary JavaScript whenever the logo is displayed, allowing for actions like cookie theft and session hijacking.
*   **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel can upload a malicious SVG file as the application's logo.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with admin privileges capable of uploading a logo.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

All three issues describe stored XSS vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities arise due to insufficient input sanitization and output encoding within the Bludit application.  An attacker who can authenticate into the admin panel or has the ability to create content can exploit these flaws by injecting malicious code which then executes in the browser of other users who view the compromised content or the logo.

The issues were closed by maintainers with a response claiming that these are not real issues as the admin users are trusted and the system has no user registration. However, this doesn't address the security issues that would be present if a non-trusted individual gained access to an admin account. It is also mentioned that in issue 1212 a fix was implemented which checks the MIME type of the uploaded file, this could help mitigate some instances of the vulnerability.
