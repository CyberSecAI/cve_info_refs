- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  CWE-325, which refers to the use of an insecure or weak cryptographic algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a weak cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges and user interaction is required for exploitation.
