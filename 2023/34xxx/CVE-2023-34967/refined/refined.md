  "vulnerability_information": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Lack of type checking"
    ],
    "impact": "With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all other clients this worker serves. This leads to denial of service for all clients using the affected worker.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending malformed mdssvc RPC packets to a Samba server with Spotlight enabled.",
       "Unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted RPC request to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted RPC request to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must have network access to the Samba service with Spotlight enabled.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the dalloc_value_for_key() function, where type checking is missing in callers, leading to a crash in talloc_get_size()."
