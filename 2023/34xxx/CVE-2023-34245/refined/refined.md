Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `@udecode/plate-link` package, up to version 19.7.0, does not properly sanitize URLs, specifically failing to prevent the use of the `javascript:` scheme in links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Lack of URL sanitization in the link plugin and UI component.
-  Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the ability to insert JavaScript URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted links, leading to potential XSS attacks.
-  This could result in unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities on the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Inserting a link with a `javascript:` URL via the Plate editor's various input methods (e.g. pasting, or via the link UI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to insert or modify content within the Plate editor.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges.
- User interaction is required, as a user must interact with the crafted link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix in version 20.0.0 introduces an `allowedSchemes` option, which defaults to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`.
- URLs with schemes outside of the allowed list will not render to the DOM, preventing the XSS vulnerability.
- Workarounds are suggested if upgrading isn't immediately possible, including overriding the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components to sanitize URLs.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1, with high confidentiality and integrity impacts and a network attack vector.
