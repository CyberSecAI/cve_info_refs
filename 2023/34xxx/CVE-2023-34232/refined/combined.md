Regarding issue 271

The PR replaces [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!) which is considered unsafe with [better-eval](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-eval) which executes the code in a different scope and blocks the usage of global variables

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[sfc-gh-ext-simba-lf](/sfc-gh-ext-simba-lf)** commented [Apr 14, 2023](#issuecomment-1509195336)

| The better-eval module creates objects in a VM which causes an assertion fail when assert.deepStrictEqual is used: [nodejs/node#44462](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/44462)  The assertions for test involving the eval function are changed so that only the object's values are checked for equality |

before [Version 1.6.21](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Node-js-Driver-Release-Notes)

### Attack Scenario

In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.

This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.

### Solution

On April 18, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake NodeJS driver via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake NodeJS driver before Version 1.6.21. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 1.6.21 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Snowflake NodeJS Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
