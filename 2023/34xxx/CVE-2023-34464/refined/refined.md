Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-34464:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `displaycontent` and `rendercontent` templates in XWiki not setting the `Content-Type` response header to `text/plain` when the `outputSyntax` parameter is set to `plain` or a non-HTML syntax. This allows user-supplied HTML content to be rendered as HTML instead of plain text in the browser when these templates are used with plain output syntax, which was not the intended behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into a wiki document. When another user views that document with a vulnerable `displaycontent` or `rendercontent` template using a plain output syntax, the injected script executes in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a user with programming rights or other elevated privileges is tricked into visiting a crafted URL, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the victim's rights. This allows the attacker to perform any action that the victim could perform, potentially compromising the entire XWiki installation.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the whole XWiki installation. An attacker could steal sensitive information, modify content, or disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Link Manipulation:** An attacker can create a malicious link to a page with the vulnerable `displaycontent` or `rendercontent` templates with the `outputSyntax` parameter set to `plain`. The attacker would then need to trick a victim user to visit the malicious URL, this can be done via crafted internal links or sending the link via another communication channel.
*   **User-Supplied Content:** The vulnerability occurs because users can inject HTML content into documents (such as their user profile).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit a document in the wiki. In the provided example, the attacker edits their own user profile.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a victim user into visiting a malicious URL or viewing a page where the attacker has injected malicious content.
*  **Network access:** The attacker can be remote to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional details from the provided content:**

* The issue is tracked under Jira issue [XWIKI-20290](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20290).
* The vulnerability is fixed by setting the content type to `text/plain` when the output syntax is not HTML in the `rendercontent.vm` template.
* The vulnerable code is located in the `rendercontent.vm` template file.
