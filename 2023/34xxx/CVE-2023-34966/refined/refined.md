{
  "CVE-2023-34966": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The core unmarshalling function `sl_unpack_loop()` did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run in an endless loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop vulnerability in Samba's `mdssvc` RPC service for Spotlight.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can trigger an infinite loop resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, consuming 100% CPU.",
    "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a malformed RPC request to trigger the infinite loop.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malformed RPC request."
  },
   "CVE-2023-34967": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of type checking in callers of the `dalloc_value_for_key()` function within Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion vulnerability in Samba's mdssvc RPC service.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious client or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process affecting other clients.",
     "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can send a specially crafted RPC request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated client capable of sending a malformed RPC request."
  },
  "CVE-2023-34968": {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "Samba's Spotlight protocol discloses the server-side absolute path of shares and files/directories in search results.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-side share path disclosure vulnerability in Samba's Spotlight protocol.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Disclosure of server-side paths, that could be used for further attacks or to disclose confidential information.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by sending a spotlight request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can use spotlight to disclose the server-side share path."

  "CVE-2022-2127":{
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient bounds-checking in Winbind when handling the lan manager response length during NTLM authentication.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Winbind's AUTH_CRAP mechanism when handling a maliciously crafted NTLM authentication request.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An out-of-bounds read in Winbind can be triggered, potentially leading to a crash.",
        "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted NTLM authentication request. Exploitable remotely if samba's ntlm_auth is an authentication backend or locally with access to the winbindd socket.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For local exploitation, attacker needs access to winbindd UNIX domain socket. For remote exploitation, the attacker has to send a malicious crafted NTLM request. "

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "SMB2 packet signing is not enforced when 'server signing = required' is set or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SMB2 packet signing is not enforced even if required by the administrator/server.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting network traffic and modifying SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the data.",
