Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists in the `formFilter` function of the ASUS RT-N10LX router firmware. This function processes the MAC address provided via the `mac` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `macFilterList` function uses `fprintf` to write a formatted string containing the provided MAC address into a fixed-size buffer (`var88`). When the provided MAC address is longer than expected, it overflows the buffer leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack buffer overflow causes the httpd process to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The router becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot to restore functionality.
- **No graceful restart:** The router cannot gracefully restart after the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web interface. The request must include the `mac` parameter, with a value that's long enough to cause the buffer overflow.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerable portal is accessible through the router's web interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker would need to know what to send to the router in a POST body request.

**Technical Details:**
- The `formFilter` function retrieves the MAC address from the HTTP request.
- The `macFilterList` function uses `fprintf` to write this string into a local buffer, without proper size checks.
- The overflow occurs due to the format string passed to `fprintf`.
- The crash occurs within the `httpd` process on the MIPS architecture.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the reverse engineering tool Shambles.
- The vulnerable firmware version is 2.0.0.39.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor (ASUS) has acknowledged the vulnerability but stated that no fix will be released because the product is End-of-Life (EOL).
- The provided text includes the complete post request and the crash stack trace.
