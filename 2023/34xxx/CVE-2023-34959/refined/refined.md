Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commits and their potential security implications:

**Commit ea5791ff8ce6ea45148a171b0da5348a7c415e6f (Link: Use GuzzleHttp to check URLs)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit replaces the usage of `curl` with `GuzzleHttp` client for URL verification. The previous implementation used `curl_exec` which did not return the HTTP status code, and directly return the content of the URL. The new implementation adds a check for the HTTP status code using GuzzleHttp but still returns the content of the URL. If the check fails it returns false, but otherwise it returns true or the result from the old curl_exec.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   The new implementation uses a try-catch block that masks exceptions without proper logging.
    *   The code still returns the result of `curl_exec()` in a case where the Guzzle request was made successfully.
    *   The code is still vulnerable to SSRF attacks, as it uses user-provided URLs without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   A malicious actor can leverage the `checkUrl` function to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
    *   The attacker could potentially scan internal network resources, access sensitive information, or interact with internal services.
    *   The code does not validate the URL format, making it possible to point to internal IPs or services.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker could insert a crafted URL in any place where a URL is checked to cause an SSRF.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to submit URLs to the application.

**Commit ed946908fef23e8aa4cefc28f745f3cd6710099f (Social: block anonymous users for read\_url\_with\_open\_graph)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code makes the `read_url_with_open_graph` AJAX call accessible to anonymous users.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of authentication checks for the `read_url_with_open_graph` AJAX endpoint.
    *   This allowed unauthenticated users to trigger the open graph reading functionality.
    *   This could expose the server to SSRF attacks if the `readContentWithOpenGraph` or `verifyUrl` functions do not properly sanitize user-provided URLs.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Unauthenticated users can access the `read_url_with_open_graph` AJAX endpoint, triggering open graph reads.
    *   This endpoint relies on the `verifyUrl` function which can be exploited to perform SSRF.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker can directly call the `read_url_with_open_graph` AJAX endpoint without authentication.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication to call this endpoint.

**Commit cc278f01864948b1fb160e03f0a3dc0875d5f81f (Social: Use GuzzleHttp to verify URL with open graph)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit replaces curl with GuzzleHttp client for URL verification in the `verifyUrl` function of `social.lib.php`. The old implementation used curl and did not verify the HTTP status code, it also ignored certificate verification. The new implementation now verifies the HTTP status code and it also ignores certificate verification. The curl call is now redundant.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   The code still ignores SSL certificate verification (`'verify' => false`).
    *   The code still uses user-provided URLs without proper sanitization, leading to a potential SSRF vulnerability.
    *   The old curl call is still present and redundant.
    *   The code does not validate the URL format, making it possible to point to internal IPs or services.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   A malicious actor can leverage the `verifyUrl` function to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
    *   The attacker could potentially scan internal network resources, access sensitive information, or interact with internal services.
*  **Attack vectors:**
     *   An attacker could insert a crafted URL in any place where the `verifyUrl` function is called.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to submit URLs to the application.

**Summary:**

The commits show an attempt to improve URL handling by introducing GuzzleHttp, but the implementation contains several weaknesses. All three commits are related to SSRF vulnerabilities through URL verification functions.
The main issue lies in the improper handling of user-provided URLs without sufficient sanitization and validation, along with the lack of SSL verification and the lack of authentication in the case of the social ajax endpoint.

These issues could allow attackers to perform SSRF attacks by providing crafted URLs to trigger requests to internal resources.
