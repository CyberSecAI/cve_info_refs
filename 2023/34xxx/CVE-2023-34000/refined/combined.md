How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

# Unauthenticated IDOR to PII Disclosure in WooCommerce Stripe Gateway Plugin

[Security advisories](https://patchstack.com/category/security-advisories/)
[Security Advisory](https://patchstack.com/tag/security-advisory/)
Published 13 June 2023Updated 24 July 2023![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1afc8ea1128a413b5780e102a8032b6f?s=200&d=mm&r=g)[Rafie Muhammad](https://patchstack.com/author/rafie/)Security Researcher at PatchstackTable of Contents

[#### WordPress WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway Plugin <= 7.4.0

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/wordpress-woocommerce-stripe-payment-gateway-plugin-7-4-0-insecure-direct-object-references-idor-vulnerability)

This blog post is about the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway plugin vulnerability. If you’re a WooCommerce Stripe Gateway user, please update the plugin to at least version **7.4.1**.

**Patchstack paid plan users are protected from the vulnerability.** You can also sign up for the [Patchstack Community plan](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) to be notified about vulnerabilities as soon as they become disclosed.

For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/) for hosting companies.

## About the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway WordPress plugin

The plugin [WooCommerce Stripe Gateway](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/) (versions **7.4.0** and below, free version), which has over 900,000 active installations is known as the most popular WooCommerce Stripe payment plugin in WordPress. This plugin is developed by WooCommerce.

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x332.png)

This plugin is a WordPress plugin which allows you to accept payments directly on a store for web and mobile. With the plugin, customers can stay on the store during checkout instead of being redirected to an externally hosted checkout page.

## The security vulnerability in WooCommerce Stripe Gateway

This plugin suffers from an Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to view any WooCommnerce order’s PII data including email, user’s name, and full address. The described vulnerability was fixed in version **7.4.1** with some backported fixed version and assigned **CVE-2023-34000**.

[Find out more from the Patchstack database.](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/wordpress-woocommerce-stripe-payment-gateway-plugin-7-4-0-insecure-direct-object-references-idor-vulnerability)

The first underlying vulnerability is located on `javascript_params` function :

```
public function javascript_params() {
    global $wp;

    $order_id = absint( get_query_var( 'order-pay' ) );

    $stripe_params = [
        'title'                    => $this->title,
        'key'                      => $this->publishable_key,
        'i18n_terms'               => __( 'Please accept the terms and conditions first', 'woocommerce-gateway-stripe' ),
        'i18n_required_fields'     => __( 'Please fill in required checkout fields first', 'woocommerce-gateway-stripe' ),
        'updateFailedOrderNonce'   => wp_create_nonce( 'wc_stripe_update_failed_order_nonce' ),
        'updatePaymentIntentNonce' => wp_create_nonce( 'wc_stripe_update_payment_intent_nonce' ),
        'orderId'                  => $order_id,
        'checkout_url'             => WC_AJAX::get_endpoint( 'checkout' ),
    ];

    // If we're on the pay page we need to pass stripe.js the address of the order.
    if ( isset( $_GET['pay_for_order'] ) && 'true' === $_GET['pay_for_order'] ) { // wpcs: csrf ok.
        $order_id = wc_clean( $wp->query_vars['order-pay'] ); // wpcs: csrf ok, sanitization ok, xss ok.
        $order    = wc_get_order( $order_id );

        if ( is_a( $order, 'WC_Order' ) ) {
            $stripe_params['billing_first_name'] = $order->get_billing_first_name();
            $stripe_params['billing_last_name']  = $order->get_billing_last_name();
            $stripe_params['billing_address_1']  = $order->get_billing_address_1();
            $stripe_params['billing_address_2']  = $order->get_billing_address_2();
            $stripe_params['billing_state']      = $order->get_billing_state();
            $stripe_params['billing_city']       = $order->get_billing_city();
            $stripe_params['billing_postcode']   = $order->get_billing_postcode();
            $stripe_params['billing_country']    = $order->get_billing_country();
        }
    }
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Notice that the code will fetch an order object to `$order` variable using the `$order_id` variable. The `$order_id` variable is constructed from `$wp->query_vars['order-pay']`. According to the [query\_vars](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/query_vars/) documentation, this hook could be used to fetch parameter from the GET parameters.

The code then will construct a `$stripe_params` variable with details from the `$order` object such as user’s full name and full address. There is no orders ownership check on the rest of the function code and the function will return `$order` as an object.

When traced, the `javascript_params` variable could be called from the `payment_scripts` function:

```
public function payment_scripts() {
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wp_localize_script(
    'woocommerce_stripe',
    'wc_stripe_params',
    apply_filters( 'wc_stripe_params', $this->javascript_params() )
);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The [wp\_localize\_script](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_localize_script/) function will return a JavaScript object variable to the front-end. The overall function call could be triggered from the site’s front page and the order’s PII disclosure will be reflected back into the page source.

The second vulnerable code exist in the `payment_fields` function:

```
public function payment_fields() {
    global $wp;
    $user                 = wp_get_current_user();
    $display_tokenization = $this->supports( 'tokenization' ) && is_checkout() && $this->saved_cards;
    $total                = WC()->cart->total;
    $user_email           = '';
    $description          = $this->get_description();
    $description          = ! empty( $description ) ? $description : '';
    $firstname            = '';
    $lastname             = '';

    // If paying from order, we need to get total from order not cart.
    if ( isset( $_GET['pay_for_order'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['key'] ) ) { // wpcs: csrf ok.
        $order      = wc_get_order( wc_clean( $wp->query_vars['order-pay'] ) ); // wpcs: csrf ok, sanitization ok.
        $total      = $order->get_total();
        $user_email = $order->get_billing_email();
    } else {
        if ( $user->ID ) {
            $user_email = get_user_meta( $user->ID, 'billing_email', true );
            $user_email = $user_email ? $user_email : $user->user_email;
        }
    }

    if ( is_add_payment_method_page() ) {
        $firstname = $user->user_firstname;
        $lastname  = $user->user_lastname;
    }

    ob_start();

    echo '<div
        id="stripe-payment-data"
        data-email="' . esc_attr( $user_email ) . '"
        data-full-name="' . esc_attr( $firstname . ' ' . $lastname ) . '"
        data-currency="' . esc_attr( strtolower( get_woocommerce_currency() ) ) . '"
    >';
```

The condition is the same as the first vulnerable code, there is no orders ownership check on the code and the function will output the billing email and user’s full name to the front-end.

## The patch in WooCommerce Stripe Gateway

Since the issue is mainly because of the code not validating the fetched order ownership, checking the endpoint using the `is_valid_pay_for_order_endpoint` function which will check the order based on the key and ownership should fix the issue. The two patches could be seen [here](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2919371/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/tags/7.4.1/includes/abstracts/abstract-wc-stripe-payment-gateway.php?old=2897942&old_path=woocommerce-gateway-stripe%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fabstracts%2Fabstract-wc-stripe-payment-gateway.php) and [here](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2919371/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/tags/7.4.1/includes/class-wc-gateway-stripe.php?old=2897942&old_path=woocommerce-gateway-stripe%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fclass-wc-gateway-stripe.php):

## Conclusion

One of the critical flow for WooCommerce related plugin is handling order object. In many cases, order object is referenced from user input that is coming from WordPress [query\_vars](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/query_vars/). Make sure to always check access control around order object by checking the order key and ownership.
