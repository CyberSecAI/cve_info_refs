### Your Kiosk Project

Kiosk projects require staff to be self-service kiosk experts and create and maintain custom kiosk functionality to enable their kiosk application to perform safely and efficiently.

### Staff & Budget

With staff turnover, the self-service kiosk learning curve is steep, forcing kiosk projects to exceed schedule and budget as well as introducing quality assurance uncertainty.
