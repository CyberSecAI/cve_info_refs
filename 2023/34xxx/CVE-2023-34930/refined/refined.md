Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow caused by the usage of `sscanf` with an unbounded format specifier (`%[^;]`) when processing the `param` value in the `/goform/aspForm` route, specifically when `CMD` is set to `EditMacList`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `sscanf` function copies data into stack allocated variables (`v12`, `v14`, `v15`, `v13`) without checking the length of the input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The program does not validate or sanitize the `param` value before passing it to `sscanf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The stack overflow causes the `webs` process to restart, leading to a denial of service (DoS). It's possible that with a more precise crafted payload the attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to know the specific path `/goform/aspForm` and the required parameters (`CMD=EditMacList`).
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, so it is possible that the attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the handling function for the `EditMacList` command.
- The `sscanf` function is used to parse the value of the `param` parameter.
- The format string `"%[^;]"` is used without any length limitation, meaning that `sscanf` will keep copying characters to the buffer until a semicolon is found, leading to a potential overflow if the input is long enough.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how sending an oversized `param` parameter can cause the `webs` process to crash.
