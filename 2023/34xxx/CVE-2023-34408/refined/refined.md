Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-34408:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the title of an RSS feed was not correctly escaped when rendered in the XHTML output by DokuWiki. The `SimplePie` library, used for parsing RSS feeds, does not perform content escaping by itself and passes the content as-is from the feed. This leads to an XSS vulnerability when a malicious title is present in the feed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By crafting a malicious RSS feed with a title containing JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user viewing the page that renders this RSS feed.
- **Lack of Output Sanitization:** The DokuWiki's XHTML renderer did not properly escape the RSS feed title before outputting it to the page. This lack of sanitization allows unsanitized content from an external source (the RSS feed) to be displayed in the user's browser.
- **Incorrect Assumption:** The code assumed that `SimplePie` would handle the content escaping, which was not the case. This highlights a common mistake where developers rely on third-party libraries to sanitize output, without verifying the library's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, leading to a variety of malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website or manipulating content.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious RSS Feed:** An attacker needs to control or inject content into an RSS feed that a DokuWiki instance is configured to consume. The attack is triggered when a user visits a page displaying the content of this manipulated RSS feed.
- **External Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by external input from an RSS feed. The DokuWiki parser does not sanitize this external data, which can lead to an attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or control the content of an RSS feed that is being consumed by a DokuWiki instance. This could involve:
  - Hosting a malicious RSS feed and tricking users to add it to their DokuWiki instance.
  - Compromising an existing, trusted RSS feed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by `@Ry0taK` and reported through Huntr.
- The fix involved properly escaping the RSS feed title using the `hsc()` function before outputting it to the document.
- The patch also applied additional escaping to the description output, though it was considered relatively safe due to the use of `striptags()`.
- The vulnerability was classified as "Severity: Medium."
- The fix was applied to the stable and old-stable versions of DokuWiki.
