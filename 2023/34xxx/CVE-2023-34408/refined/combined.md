The title was not correctly escaped when written to the doc in xhtml
renderer.

SimplePie does no content escaping on its own (a comment in the code
seems to suggest that that was assumed). Instead the content is passed
on as-is from the feed.

This patch also applies some more escaping on the description output
(though it should have been relatively safe thanks to the use of
striptags).

### @splitbrain **[splitbrain](/splitbrain)** commented [May 15, 2023](#issue-1709387684)

The title was not correctly escaped when written to the doc in xhtml renderer.

SimplePie does no content escaping on its own (a comment in the code seems to suggest that that was assumed). Instead the content is passed on as-is from the feed.

This patch also applies some more escaping on the description output (though it should have been relatively safe thanks to the use of striptags).

This was discovered by [@Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK) and reported in

<https://huntr.dev/bounties/c6119106-1a5c-464c-94dd-ee7c5d0bece0/>

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@bug](https://github.com/bug) I did the hotfix for stable. We don't have an automated workflow for old-stable, yet. I guess it would need to be done manually if we wanna do it. Could you have a look? |
