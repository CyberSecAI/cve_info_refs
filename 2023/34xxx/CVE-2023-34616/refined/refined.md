The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34616.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow error caused by the `progsbase` library's JSON parser when handling deeply nested JSON structures. The recursive nature of the parsing logic leads to excessive stack usage, eventually causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unbounded Recursion:** The parser doesn't limit the depth of nested JSON objects or arrays, resulting in uncontrolled recursion.
- **Lack of Depth Check:** There is no mechanism to check or prevent excessive nesting during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can provide a maliciously crafted JSON string with deep nesting, forcing the parser to crash due to a stack overflow, disrupting the application/service relying on it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User-supplied JSON input:** If the parser processes user-supplied JSON, an attacker can inject malicious JSON.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to supply a JSON string to be parsed by the vulnerable `progsbase` library. This could be through a web API, file uploads, or other means of interaction with the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how to generate a deeply nested JSON structure that triggers the stack overflow.
- The issue suggests a solution based on fixes implemented in other libraries like `jackson-databind` and GSON, such as adding a depth check or changing to iterative processing instead of recursion.
