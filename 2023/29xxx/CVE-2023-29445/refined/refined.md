Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-29445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The core issue is that the KEPServerEX binary is susceptible to DLL search order hijacking. This means that when the KEPServerEX application loads, it searches for required DLL files in a predictable order, and if an attacker can place a malicious DLL in one of the earlier search locations, the application will load and execute that malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** The vulnerability lies in the application's insecure manner of searching for and loading DLL files. Specifically, the KEPServerEX binary lacks proper control over the search path used to locate necessary DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a locally authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges to administrator level. This is because the malicious DLL is loaded in the context of the KEPServerEX process, which runs with elevated permissions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By loading a malicious DLL, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with administrator privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system. This means the attack isn't directly exploitable remotely.
*   **DLL Planting:** The attacker must be able to write a malicious DLL to a specific directory where the vulnerable application searches for DLLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Authentication:** The attacker must have some form of valid local authentication on the target system.
*   **Write Access:**  The attacker needs write access to a directory that is part of the DLL search path for KEPServerEX.
*   **Knowledge of DLL search paths:** The attacker must know where the application searches for DLL files to place their malicious DLL in the correct location.
    
**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects KEPServerEX versions 6.14.263.0 and prior.
*   ThingWorx Kepware Server versions 6.14.263.0 and prior, and ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity versions 8.0 to 8.5 are also affected.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

The information provided is consistent with the typical characteristics of a DLL hijacking vulnerability and includes more technical details than a simple CVE description would provide.
