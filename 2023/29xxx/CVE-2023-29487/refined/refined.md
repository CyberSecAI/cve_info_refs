{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unknown flaw causes the Threat to Process Correlation (TTPC) component to fail to display the correct information about the offending process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The TTPC component fails to identify and report the correct process responsible for a security violation. This leads to a lack of visibility into security events.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is a reduction in the effectiveness of security investigations due to the inability to correctly identify the offending process and its path. This impacts the integrity and availability of data for investigation and makes threat analysis less reliable.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a process performing a security violation. In the described test, the use of a browser to download a prohibited software triggers the flaw.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger a security violation that would normally be detected by the TTPC component. No special privileges or complex actions are needed."
