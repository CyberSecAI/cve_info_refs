Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the App Within Minutes (AWM) application in XWiki. When a user creates an application using AWM, the system incorrectly grants the user administrative rights over the newly created space. This occurs even if the user does not have the necessary "script" right, which is a prerequisite for administrative functions in XWiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Privilege Assignment:** The primary vulnerability is the flawed logic in AWM that grants space admin rights upon application creation, bypassing the usual requirement for script rights.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:** The vulnerability can be triggered even if the button to create an app is disabled due to lack of global edit right by directly accessing the `CreateApplication` URL.
- **Implied Script Rights:** Admin rights automatically grant the user the script right.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A user without administrative privileges can become an administrator of a specific space.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Since admin rights imply script rights, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages within the space. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and further privilege escalation if other users visit the compromised space.
- **Unauthorized Data Modification/Access:** With admin rights, the attacker has full control over the space and its sub-pages, allowing them to modify or delete content and potentially gain access to sensitive data within the space.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **AWM Application Creation:** The attack vector is primarily through the creation of a new application using the AWM feature.
- **Direct URL Access:** If the AWM creation button is disabled, attackers can bypass this by directly navigating to the `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/CreateApplication?wizard=true` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **XWiki User Account:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the vulnerable XWiki instance.
- **Ability to Create a Space:** The attacker must have the ability to create a new space within the XWiki system.
- **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a user with low privileges, as it does not require any existing admin rights.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix for this issue involves checking if the user has script rights on the space where the app is created before granting admin rights. Error messages are displayed if the user lacks script rights, indicating that the app may not function correctly.
- The fix does not remove existing admin rights granted due to this vulnerability, so administrators need to check and manually revoke those rights if necessary.
- Workarounds include patching specific wiki documents and denying view access to `AppWithinMinutes.LiveTableEditSheet`
