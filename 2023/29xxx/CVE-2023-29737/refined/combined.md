October 30, 2024I love your keyboard themes they're amazing. I don't like the fact that you don't have slide to text that lets you slide from 1 letter to the next & it types your word I currently use Gboard which allows side typing & it has emojis suggestions at the top everything I need is right at the top of the keyboard in a row If you can input those two things I'll reinstall. Hope you fix those 2 things ASAP as I'd love to reinstall your keyboard right away & use it NOW!!7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBR-JbgcmpObc4RdgMrsqyRIngsktR_S18VkYx9WJE_iRYo83z=s32-rw)Sanjiv Joshi*more\_vert*
