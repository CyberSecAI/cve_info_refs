Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2023-29400:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `html/template` package of the Go programming language.
- Templates that have actions within unquoted HTML attributes (e.g., `attr={{.}}`) can lead to unexpected output when executed with empty input.
- This is due to how HTML normalization rules process such cases, which can enable the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of empty HTML attributes in the `html/template` package.
- Lack of proper sanitization when handling actions in unquoted HTML attributes.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- Disclosure of sensitive information.
- Addition or modification of data.
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- Injection of arbitrary attributes into HTML tags.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- Network (AV:N)
- Attacker provides an empty input to a template that uses actions in unquoted HTML attributes.
- Vulnerability is triggered when a crafted template with a vulnerable action is executed.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- No privileges required (PR:N)
- No user interaction required (UI:N)
- An attacker would need the ability to influence the input being processed by a vulnerable Go application.
- An attacker can remotely exploit the vulnerability using a network vector (AV:N).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Golang versions prior to 1.19.9 and versions 1.20.0 prior to 1.20.4.
- NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability if they incorporate vulnerable versions of Golang.
- NetApp has identified a list of products that are NOT affected by this vulnerability.
- NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
- No patches or workarounds are available yet from NetApp.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.3 (HIGH) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L.
