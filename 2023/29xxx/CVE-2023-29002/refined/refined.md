- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cilium, when run in debug mode, logs sensitive information, including HTTP headers matching network policy rules and, in certain versions, secrets like TLS private keys used for Ingress and GatewayAPI resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Logging of sensitive HTTP header information when debug mode is enabled.
    - Logging of secrets used by the Cilium agent, such as TLS private keys, under specific conditions in debug mode.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Exposure of sensitive HTTP header information that can lead to information disclosure.
    - Exposure of secrets such as TLS private keys, potentially allowing unauthorized access to encrypted communications and resources.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered when Cilium is run in debug mode.
    - The logging of secrets occurs during Cilium agent restart, secret modifications, and on creation of Ingress or GatewayAPI resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have access to the logs generated by Cilium running in debug mode.
    - The attacker needs to be in a position to create or modify Ingress or GatewayAPI resources to trigger the logging of secrets in specific versions.
    - The vulnerability requires high privileges in order to enable debug mode on the Cilium agent.
