Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way XWiki handles user lookups in subwikis when sharing a page. Specifically, the `uorgsuggest.vm` component was not correctly resolving user page references relative to the wiki the user belongs to, instead using the current wiki. This allowed the system to suggest users from the main wiki even when those users had restricted access in the subwiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed an unauthenticated user to discover information about hidden users on the main wiki through the user suggestion feature in a subwiki.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The user suggestion mechanism failed to enforce access controls properly, revealing information about users that should not have been visible within a specific subwiki's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker could enumerate usernames and first/last names of users who are hidden in the main wiki, gaining insight into user accounts that are not meant to be visible from a subwiki.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to access the affected XWiki instance and trigger the user suggestion mechanism in a subwiki using the `uorgsuggest.vm` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication or special privileges to exploit this issue.
- The attacker needs network access to the XWiki instance.
- The attacker must be able to access a subwiki to trigger the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is a regression of a previous issue (GHSA-97jg-43c9-q6pf) and was not fully patched originally.
- The disclosed information is limited to username, first name, and last name. No other user information was leaked.
- Patches were released in versions 13.10.8, 14.4.3 and 14.7RC1 of XWiki
- A workaround is available by patching `uorgsuggest.vm` as per the fix in pull request #1883.
