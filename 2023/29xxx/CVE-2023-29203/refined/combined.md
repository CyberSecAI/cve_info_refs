# Unauthenticated user can have information about hidden users on subwikis through uorgsuggest.vm

Low

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-vvp7-r422-rx83
Apr 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 13.9RC1

## Patched versions

13.10.8, 14.4.3, 14.7RC1

## Description

### Impact

It's possible to list some users who are normally not viewable from subwiki by requesting users on a subwiki which allows only global users with `uorgsuggest.vm`. This issue only concerns hidden users from main wiki.

Note that the disclosed information are the username and the first and last name of users, no other information is leaked.

### Patches

The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.8, 14.4.3 and 14.7RC1.

### Workarounds

It's possible to workaround this vulnerability by patching directly `uorgsuggest.vm`  to apply the same changes as in [#1883](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/1883).

### References

* JIRA ticket: <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20007>
* this vulnerability is actually a remaining of [GHSA-97jg-43c9-q6pf](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-97jg-43c9-q6pf "GHSA-97jg-43c9-q6pf") which wasn't entirely fixed back then

### For more information

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

## Steps to reproduce

* On main wiki, create users XWiki.Alice and XWiki.Bob.
* Restrict view access to page XWiki.Bob to XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup.
* Create subwiki where only global users are available.
* Log in as Alice, go to home page of the newly created subwiki and hit "Share page".
* Type "b" in the "Send to" field of the share page dialog.

## Actual result

User page "XWiki.Bob" gets suggested while it should not since it's not viewable by Alice.
