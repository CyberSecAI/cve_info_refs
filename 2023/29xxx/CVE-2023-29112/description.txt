The SAP Application Interface (Message Monitoring) - versions 600, 700, allows an authorized attacker to input links or headings with custom CSS classes into a comment. The comment will render links and custom CSS classes as HTML objects. After successful exploitations, an attacker can cause limited impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the application.
