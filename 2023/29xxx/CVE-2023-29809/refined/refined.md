Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-29809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `bookmap` parameter of the `/rest/booking/index.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `bookmap` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the application is vulnerable because of lack of sanitization in the `bookmap` parameter when processing database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database compromise: An attacker can potentially dump the entire database, including sensitive information like LDAP credentials.
- Arbitrary SQL execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data manipulation, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.
- System compromise: Depending on the database configuration and privileges, the attacker might be able to execute system-level commands or gain control of the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameter: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious payload within the `bookmap` parameter of an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable endpoint: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication required: The SQL injection is unauthenticated, which means that any attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `index.php` file, specifically on line 152 where it handles the `bookmap` parameter.
- The injection can be confirmed by appending a single quote to the `bookmap` parameter, which causes an error due to an invalid SQL query
- An example of a payload that triggers the vulnerability is `'-(select*from(select+sleep(2)+from+dual)a)--+` which causes the page to sleep for 2 seconds, which confirms the SQL injection is viable.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap`.
