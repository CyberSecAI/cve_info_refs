Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29154:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the query settings page of the Contec CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS). Specifically, the application fails to prevent the execution of arbitrary SQL commands via specially crafted input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application allows the execution of arbitrary SQL commands through user-controlled parameters in the query settings page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information theft: An attacker could leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- Data manipulation: Although the impact is primarily focused on information disclosure, there is a potential for data alteration.
- System compromise: Depending on the database permissions, attackers might be able to use the SQL injection to escalate privileges, possibly leading to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted over the network via the web interface of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the query settings page where the SQL injection occurs.

**Summary:**
The CVE-2023-29154 is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the query settings page of the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS). An authenticated user with administrative privileges can execute arbitrary SQL commands by crafting malicious input on the query settings page. Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure and potentially data manipulation. The vulnerability is network-based.
