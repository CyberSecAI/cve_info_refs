The provided document is a security bulletin from BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) detailing vulnerabilities found in their BD FACSChorus software and associated workstations.

**CVE-2023-29062 - Unsecure Identity Verification**

*   **Root Cause:** The operating system hosting the FACSChorus application is configured to allow transmission of hashed user credentials upon user action without adequately validating the identity of the requested resource. This occurs through the use of LLMNR, MBT-NS, or MDNS protocols.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper identity validation when transmitting user credentials
    *   Use of vulnerable network protocols (LLMNR, MBT-NS, MDNS) that can be exploited by a malicious actor on the local network.
    *   Transmission of NTLMv2 hashes which are susceptible to brute force attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain NTLMv2 hashes of user credentials. These hashes can be cracked via brute-force techniques if users have weak passwords, potentially granting the attacker access to other systems connected to the same domain.  The compromise primarily affects the confidentiality of user credentials.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network requests on the local network by acting as a malicious resource.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Must be on the same local network as the victim machine.
    *   Must be able to set up a malicious server to intercept the network requests.
    *   Requires a victim user to initiate a network request

The document provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description, such as the specific network protocols involved and the type of credential hash that can be captured. It also clarifies that this vulnerability only applies to domain-joined systems.
