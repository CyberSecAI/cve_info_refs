Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of context within the `async` and `display` macros in XWiki. Specifically, the `display` macro, when used inside an `async` macro, executes with the privileges of a superadmin user instead of the current user's permissions when accessed via the comments viewer. This bypasses the intended access restrictions. The `rendering.restricted` context entry is not correctly handled by the context store.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Context Propagation:** The `async` macro does not properly propagate the user's context to the `display` macro when used in a comments viewer.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `display` macro executes with elevated privileges (superadmin) due to the incorrect context, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Bypassed Access Controls:** The vulnerability allows users to view and interact with documents they should not have access to, violating the intended access controls.
*   **CSRF Token Leakage:** The vulnerability can expose the superadmin's CSRF token through interactions with the `display` macro.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the content of restricted documents.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can perform actions as a superadmin via the displayed documents (e.g. change theme).
*   **CSRF Token Theft:** Attackers can steal the superadmin's CSRF token.
*   **Potential RCE:**  While not directly confirmed, there are hints that some documents could lead to Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **Comments Viewer:** The vulnerability is triggered through the comments viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges, such as a guest user with commenting rights.
*   **Ability to create comments:** The attacker needs to be able to create comments on the XWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of XWiki syntax:** The attacker needs to use the `{{async}}` and `{{display}}` macros in their comments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as critical.
*   The issue is fixed in XWiki versions 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11.
*   There is no known workaround.
*   The vulnerability is related to XRENDERING-694 which is a bug where the `rendering.restricted` context entry is not taken into account by the context store.
