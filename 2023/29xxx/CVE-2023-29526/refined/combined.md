#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Enable comments for guests by giving guests comment rights
2. As a guest, create a comment with content
   ```
   {{async}}{{display reference="Menu.WebHome" /}}{{/async}}
   ```

   and another one with content

   ```
   {{async context="request.parameters"}}{{display reference="FlamingoThemes.WebHome" /}}{{/async}}
   ```
3. Open the comments viewer from the menu (appends ?viewer=comments to the URL)
4. Right-click and copy one of the URLs for "Use this theme", e.g., the URL of the "Cyborg" theme. It should look like <http://localhost:8090/xwiki/bin/view/FlamingoThemes/?action=setTheme&theme=FlamingoThemes.Cyborg&form_token=bw2VMc2UsUhxQk6LS1yYoQ> but with a different token.
5. Paste the copied URL after the current URL in the address bar and replace everything before the ? by & and open this new URL.
6. Reload the page.

**Expected result:**

The menu home page isn't displayed as guests don't have view rights on Menu.WebHome and the theme is unchanged.

**Actual result:**

The menu home page is displayed and the theme has been changed to the Cyborg theme.

This demonstrates that the display macro inside the async macro allows displaying arbitrary documents in the comments viewer as the context user is now superadmin and that those documents aren't restricted in any way and we can interact with them via the request parameters and execute actions as superadmin when the documents contain such code as the theme selector. Already with the theme selector, we've also obtained the CSRF token of superadmin which is useful in case some document requires it. I've experienced errors (generally, null pointer exceptions) with some documents like CKEditor.HTMLConverter (which would be the key to universal RCE) so I'm not sure how universally this can be used to gain privileges, maybe also more context entries need to be preserved to prevent these errors.

I've reproduced this issue on 14.9 and on the most recent 14.10 snapshot but it seems likely that this issue can also be reproduced on older versions of XWiki.

# Async and display macro allow displaying and interacting with any document in restricted mode

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-gpq5-7p34-vqx5
Apr 18, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore, org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 10.11.1, >= 11.10

## Patched versions

15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11

## Description

### Impact

It's possible to display any page you cannot access through the combination of the async and display macro.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable comments for guests by giving guests comment rights
2. As a guest, create a comment with content `{{async}}{{display reference="Menu.WebHome" /}}{{/async}}`
3. Open the comments viewer from the menu (appends ?viewer=comments to the URL)

-> the `Menu.WebHome` is displayed while the expectation would be to have an error that the current user is not allowed to see it

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
