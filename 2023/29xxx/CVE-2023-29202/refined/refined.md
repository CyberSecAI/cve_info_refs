Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29202:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The XWiki RSS macro, when the `content` parameter is set to `true`, includes the content of the feed items without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of RSS feed content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when viewing a page with the vulnerable RSS macro.
- Privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, content manipulation and sabotage: These are all possible due to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. An attacker could escalate privileges, execute code remotely, disclose sensitive information, modify/delete content, and sabotage the wiki.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious RSS feed: The attacker needs to control or create a malicious RSS feed that contains JavaScript or other malicious HTML.
- RSS macro: The attacker injects the malicious RSS feed using the RSS macro on a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User with programming rights: The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit pages in the XWiki instance and use the RSS macro. This is generally a user with "programming rights" on the wiki.
- Knowledge of XWiki syntax: The attacker must know how to use the RSS macro and set the `content` parameter to `true`.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions >= 1.8 and <= 3.0.1 and is fixed in 14.6-rc-1.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-c885-89fw-55qr in GitHub Security Advisories and XWIKI-19671 in XWiki's Jira.
- The fix includes cleaning the HTML content of the feed before displaying it.
- A workaround is to remove the RSS macro's jar file if not in use, which is `WEB-INF/lib/xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-rss-XX.jar`

The provided information gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how to remediate it, and matches the description of CVE-2023-29202, therefore this is deemed RELAVENT.
