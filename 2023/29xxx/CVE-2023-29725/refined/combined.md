August 6, 2021Kudos to the dev for creating a genuinely useful app. After getting many spam calls call I just wanted to be able to receive calls from my contact list & other calls to go to voicemail . I was disappointed that this isn't available in the default phone app on my phone. Thankfully the dev of this app provided a solution. I paid for the premium version as I like to support the work of good developers. I gave 4 stars as there are some UI changes and additional features that could be added.25 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoApplika GmbHAugust 6, 2021Hi and thanks.

January 2, 2025Recently I user one app "Multi Call Blocker" which has a winderful option. There are four options for every contact "Allow, Silent, Ignore, Reject". I like very much the IGNORE option because, the person who calls us can hear ringing sound but there is no INCOMING CALL on our phone's screen. Will you introduce this feature, please?Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbIKOhO4OGDOtqoWloVD8DKPkQe2z-QmKEjq7PNmxnBzisyA=s32-rw-mo)NotMy RealName*more\_vert*

December 16, 2024No matter what notification settings I select in the app, they get ignored. If you are using an program or playing a game, this stupid app will interrupt you by putting a huge notification and ads on your screen whenever it blocks a call. The entire point of this app is to avoid the irritation of spam calls. All this app does is replace the irritation from the spam call, to its own beeps, ads, and interruptions. Terrible design.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoApplika GmbHFebruary 20, 2023Hi, you can disable this feature from the app settings. Just go to the settings tab, select "Notifications" and disable the "Pop-up banner for blocked calls" option. For more information contact us at support@call-blocker.info, we will be happy to help you. Thank youSee all reviews
