**3/31 UPDATE** After review and reverse engineering by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, the signed MSI (`aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868`) is malicious.

The MSI will drop three files, with the primary fulcrum being the compromised binary ffmpeg.dll (`7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896`).

Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure and encryption key match those observed by CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023 campaign attributed with high confidence to DPRK-nexus threat actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.

**Original Post**

On March 29, 2023, CrowdStrike observed unexpected malicious activity emanating from a legitimate, signed binary, 3CXDesktopApp — a softphone application from 3CX. The malicious activity includes beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.

The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform has behavioral preventions and atomic indicator detections targeting the abuse of 3CXDesktopApp. In addition, CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ helps customers stay vigilant against hands-on-keyboard activity.

***CrowdStrike customers can log into the customer support portal and follow the latest updates in** [**Trending Threats & Vulnerabilities: Intrusion Campaign Targeting 3CX Customers**](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Trending-Threats-Vulnerabilities-Intrusion-Campaign-Targeting-3CX-Customers)*

The 3CXDesktopApp is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and mobile. At this time, activity has been observed on both Windows and macOS.

CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed there is suspected nation-state involvement by the threat actor [LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA](/en-us/adversaries/labyrinth-chollima/). CrowdStrike Intelligence customers received an alert this morning on this active intrusion.

## **CrowdStrike Falcon Detection and Protection**

![](https://play.vidyard.com/uTjAZGHEuZnPioHJ1HZQJU.jpg)

Watch how the CrowdStrike Falcon platform detects and prevents an active intrusion campaign targeting 3CXDesktopApp users.

The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects customers from this attack and has coverage utilizing behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) based detections targeting malicious behaviors associated with 3CX on both macOS and Windows.

Customers should ensure that [prevention policies](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Prevention-Policy-Best-Practice-Guidelines) are properly configured with Suspicious Processes enabled.

## **Hunting in the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform**

**Falcon Discover** CrowdStrike Falcon® Discover customers can use the following link: [US-1](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [US-2](https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [EU-1](https://falcon.eu-1.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [US-GOV-1](https://falcon.laggar.gcw.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) to look for the presence of 3CXDesktopApp in their environment.

Falcon Insight customers can assess if the 3CXDesktopApp is running in their environment with the following query:

**Event Search — Application Search**

```

event_simpleName IN (PeVersionInfo, ProcessRollup2) FileName IN ("3CXDesktopApp.exe", "3CX Desktop App")
| stats dc(aid) as endpointCount by event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData

```

**Falcon Long Term Repository (LTR) powered by Falcon LogScale — Application Search**

```

#event_simpleName=/^(PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ AND (event_platform=Win ImageFileName=/\\3CXDesktopApp\.exe$/i) OR (event_platform=Mac ImageFileName=/\/3CX\sDesktop\sApp/i)
| ImageFileName = /.+(\\|\/)(?<FileName>.+)$/i
| groupBy(, function=count(aid, distinct=true, as=endpointCount))

```
```

Atomic Indicators

The following domains have been observed beaconing, which should be considered an indication of malicious intent.

## **Recommendations**

The current recommendation for all CrowdStrike customers is:

1. Locate the presence of 3CXDesktopApp software in your environment by using the queries outlined above.
2. Ensure Falcon is deployed to applicable systems.
3. Ensure “Suspicious Processes” is enabled in applicable [Prevention Policies](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Prevention-Policy-Best-Practice-Guidelines).
4. Hunt for historical presence of atomic indicators in third-party tooling (if available).

### CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Assessment

**High Confidence**: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.

**Moderate Confidence**: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.

**Low Confidence**: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.

**Note: Content from this post first appeared in** [**r/CrowdStrike**](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike.html)

**3/31 UPDATE** After review and reverse engineering by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, the signed MSI (`aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868`) is malicious.

The MSI will drop three files, with the primary fulcrum being the compromised binary ffmpeg.dll (`7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896`).

Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure and encryption key match those observed by CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023 campaign attributed with high confidence to DPRK-nexus threat actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.

**Original Post**

On March 29, 2023, CrowdStrike observed unexpected malicious activity emanating from a legitimate, signed binary, 3CXDesktopApp — a softphone application from 3CX. The malicious activity includes beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.

The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform has behavioral preventions and atomic indicator detections targeting the abuse of 3CXDesktopApp. In addition, CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ helps customers stay vigilant against hands-on-keyboard activity.

***CrowdStrike customers can log into the customer support portal and follow the latest updates in** [**Trending Threats & Vulnerabilities: Intrusion Campaign Targeting 3CX Customers**](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Trending-Threats-Vulnerabilities-Intrusion-Campaign-Targeting-3CX-Customers)*

The 3CXDesktopApp is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and mobile. At this time, activity has been observed on both Windows and macOS.

CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed there is suspected nation-state involvement by the threat actor [LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA](/en-us/adversaries/labyrinth-chollima/). CrowdStrike Intelligence customers received an alert this morning on this active intrusion.

## **CrowdStrike Falcon Detection and Protection**

![](https://play.vidyard.com/uTjAZGHEuZnPioHJ1HZQJU.jpg)

Watch how the CrowdStrike Falcon platform detects and prevents an active intrusion campaign targeting 3CXDesktopApp users.

The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects customers from this attack and has coverage utilizing behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) based detections targeting malicious behaviors associated with 3CX on both macOS and Windows.

Customers should ensure that [prevention policies](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Prevention-Policy-Best-Practice-Guidelines) are properly configured with Suspicious Processes enabled.

## **Hunting in the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform**

**Falcon Discover** CrowdStrike Falcon® Discover customers can use the following link: [US-1](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [US-2](https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [EU-1](https://falcon.eu-1.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) | [US-GOV-1](https://falcon.laggar.gcw.crowdstrike.com/discover/applications/inventory/group-by-application?filter=name%3A%273CXDesktopApp.exe%27) to look for the presence of 3CXDesktopApp in their environment.

Falcon Insight customers can assess if the 3CXDesktopApp is running in their environment with the following query:

**Event Search — Application Search**

```

event_simpleName IN (PeVersionInfo, ProcessRollup2) FileName IN ("3CXDesktopApp.exe", "3CX Desktop App")
| stats dc(aid) as endpointCount by event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData

```

**Falcon Long Term Repository (LTR) powered by Falcon LogScale — Application Search**

```

#event_simpleName=/^(PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ AND (event_platform=Win ImageFileName=/\\3CXDesktopApp\.exe$/i) OR (event_platform=Mac ImageFileName=/\/3CX\sDesktop\sApp/i)
| ImageFileName = /.+(\\|\/)(?<FileName>.+)$/i
| groupBy(, function=count(aid, distinct=true, as=endpointCount))

```
```

Atomic Indicators

The following domains have been observed beaconing, which should be considered an indication of malicious intent.

## **Recommendations**

The current recommendation for all CrowdStrike customers is:

1. Locate the presence of 3CXDesktopApp software in your environment by using the queries outlined above.
2. Ensure Falcon is deployed to applicable systems.
3. Ensure “Suspicious Processes” is enabled in applicable [Prevention Policies](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Prevention-Policy-Best-Practice-Guidelines).
4. Hunt for historical presence of atomic indicators in third-party tooling (if available).

### CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Assessment

**High Confidence**: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.

**Moderate Confidence**: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.

**Low Confidence**: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.

![3CX Desktop App Compromised (CVE-2023-29059) | FortiGuard Labs ](data:image/png;base64...)

FortiGuard Labs Threat Research

# 3CX Desktop App Compromised (CVE-2023-29059)

By
[FortiGuard Labs](/blog/search?author=FortiGuard+Labs+)

 | March 30, 2023

*This is a developing story. Please check back for the latest updates from FortiGuard Labs. For a report of this event, please visit our [Threat Signal Reports](https://www.fortiguard.com/threat-signal-report/5102/supply-chain-attack-through-3cx-desktop-app?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=3cx-threat "3cx threat signal report") page.*

On March 29, a number of reports surfaced thata legitimate signed file from VoIP/IP PBX solutions provider 3CX (3CXDesktop App) had been trojanized due to a code-level compromise. This is the latest high-profile [supply chain attack](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campagin=supply-chain-attack "supply chain attack"), beginning with SolarWinds and Kaseya a few years ago. This issue has been assigned [CVE-2023-29059.](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-29059/ "cve details")

3CXDesktop App is a multi-platform softphone application for desktops (Linux, MacOS, and Windows). The 3CXDesktop App allows users to interact via chat, messaging, video, and voice. Initial reports suggested that all platforms of the 3CXDesktop App were compromised. But at the time of writing, it appears that only the Electron framework versions of MacOS (versions 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407, and 18.12.416) and Windows (versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416) of the 3CX Desktop App are [affected](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/desktopapp-security-alert/ "3cx app affected").  3CX has stated that they are working on a new version of the Windows app and have revoked the certificate for the previous version. Initially, there was some confusion about whether the MacOS version was affected, as the CEO of 3CX issued a statement that only the Windows version of the app was affected. However, this statement was later [retracted](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/desktopapp-security-alert-updates/ "3cx retracted"). Currently, no status on the availability of the MacOS version has been provided at the time of writing.

The company’s website boasts that 3CX is available in over 190 countries worldwide, with over 12 million daily users and a 600,000-plus customer base. Companies listed on its website include high-profile organizations in the automobile, aerospace, finance, food and beverage, government, hospitality, and manufacturing sectors, to name a few.

The trojanized 3CX Desktop App is part of a multi-stage attack that utilizes a malicious sideloaded DLL (ffmpeg.dll - SHA256: 7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896) that contains instructions and a payload within another DLL via an encrypted blob (d3dcompiler\_47.dll – SHA256: 11be1803e2e307b647a8a7e02d128335c448ff741bf06bf52b332e0bbf423b03). This blob also contains the shellcode, which tries to pull ICO files from GitHub (currently down) that contain various URIs for download, where the payload is ultimately loaded and installed to the target environment. However, we could not confirm further details as the repository is currently down.

## Discovery of Two 3CXDesktopApp.exes – but Only One Sideloads the Malicious DLL

Looking at the Windows installer (SHA256:aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868), it drops TWO 3CXDesktopApp.exe files.

The SECOND (inside app-18.12.407 folder) is the one that sideloads the ffmpeg.dll file.

## Heatmap - Focus on Europe and North America

Below is a heat map based on recent connections to known malicious domains associated with this attack that FortiGuard Labs observed at the time of writing (March 31st, 2023):

![3cx heat map of network activities associated with 3CX supply chain attack](/blog/threat-research/3cx-desktop-app-compromised/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1880535191.img.png/1680308696892/telemetry-heat-map-3cx-supply-chain-attack.png)

Figure 4. Heat map of the network activities associated with the 3CX supply chain attack

Based on our telemetry, we see that the top 10 countries highlight the geographic spread of victim machines calling out to known actor controlled infrastructure; which appears to target European and North American victims more:

![3CX breakdown of network activities by country](/blog/threat-research/3cx-desktop-app-compromised/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_941740763.img.png/1680308785625/3cx-breakdown-of-network-activities-by-country.png)

Figure 5. Breakdown of the network activities by country

The following chart reveals a regional breakdown that further proves this point as close to 80 percent of the connections to the attacker controlled infrastructure are concentrated in Europe and North America.This may indicate that the threat actor is mainly targeting enterprises in those regions – however, this is uncertain. This could be indicative of 3CX product's geographic customer base - including the possibility of various multinational corporations operating inside those regions.

Figure 6. Regional breakdown of 3CX network activities

## What Mitigations Are Available?

3CX [suggests](https://www.3cx.com/user-manual/web-client/#h.85vdwzu7eh2a "3cx suggested mitigations") that users migrate to the PWA app in the meantime. The PWA app is web-based and is unaffected by the supply chain attack. Customers on 3CXHosted and StartUP are not affected. Additional details on updates and best practices can be found [here](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/desktopapp-security-alert-updates/ "3cx updates"). FortiGuard Labs suggests that all older variants of the 3CX Desktop App be discontinued immediately until newer unaffected versions are available.

The 3CX VoIP Desktop Application has been compromised to deliver malware via legitimate 3CX updates. Huntress has been investigating this incident and working to validate and assess the current supply chain threat to the security community.

**UPDATE #1 - 3/30/23 @ 2pm ET****: Added a** [**PowerShell script**](https://github.com/huntresslabs/threat-intel/blob/main/2023/2023-03/30-3CX/tools/Check-3cxVulnerability.ps1) **that can be used to check locations/versions of 3CX and run against the hashes to see if they're bad to be run in an RMM.**

At 11:40 AM EDT on March 29, 2023, Huntress received an inbound support request from a partner, concerned with [a new advisory and discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/) shared just 30 minutes prior. CrowdStrike was first to sound the alarm on a breaking incident: 3CX VoIP software installations were compromised, delivering malware to hosts running the 3CX desktop app.Â

Huntress immediately added increased monitoring for malicious activity related to the 3CX application, while working to validate this attack vector so that we could provide as much information as possible to the community.Â

From 3CXâs [recently released notification](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/desktopapp-security-alert/), the *currently known* affected 3CX DesktopApp versions are **18.12.407** and **18.12.416** for Windows and **18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 and 18.12.416** for Mac.

## Impact

At the time of writing, [Shodan reports](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.title%3A%223CX+Phone+System+Management+Console%22) there are **242,519** publicly exposed 3CX phone management systems.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dce_axJlnVDIrXYCVoV-Rk4fRUCqB37uct9KJkMJGZkZLQFSlTS3qGOEJ2ffXXrlAVWNL8luqUN0CXTmxoQoLRe5VDyP2eRqRuMNwullBKrMEBRROpNT7RhvVG-75FmaWicAgwTweccTmNfyUs1pTLVvHo8.png)

3CX claims to have over 600,000 customers, and it goes without saying, **this has the potential to be a massive supply chain attack**, likened well enough to [the SolarWinds incident](/blog/rapid-response-supply-chain-exploitation-of-solarwinds-orion-software) or the [Kaseya VSA ransomware attack](/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident) in years past.

Within our partner base, Huntress has sent out **2,783**Â incident reports where the **3CXDesktopApp.exe** binary matches known malicious hashes and was signed by 3CX on March 13, 2023. We currently have a pool of ~8,000 hosts running 3CX software.

While Huntress has notified appropriate partners, we decided not to automatically isolate 3CX hosts, in the event it could result in taking phone communication systems offline. We strongly urge you to remove the software if at all possible, as 3CX has promised a non-malicious update in the near future.

## Analysis & Investigation

On March 29, numerous EDR providers and antivirus solutions began to trigger and flag on the legitimate signed binary **3CXDesktopApp.exe**. This application had begun an update process that ultimately led to malicious behavior and command-and-control communication to numerous external servers.Â

Unfortunately in the early timeline of the community's investigation, there was confusion on whether or not this was a legitimate antivirus alert.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd9_xxQdrObRbGFwt4pa1tluheqNI6Kz2LP6v1rDkraOJGgA-ru25LgrDKoXiOeKZY0N8lest4g4Njazviwm4JNCu4KElnae--3Xynjb60LWCgLs1fLXjWe87AH9BJXLmwiP4K9MDN8I7TCLcuWTuPFj5g8.png)

The 3CX download available on the official public website had included malware. Installations already deployed will update, and ultimately pull down this malware that includes a backdoored DLL file, [**ffmpeg.dll**](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896) and an anomalous [**d3dcompiler\_47.dll**](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/11be1803e2e307b647a8a7e02d128335c448ff741bf06bf52b332e0bbf423b03).Â

For an overall visual of the attack chain, take a quick look at this primitive graph.Â

*Massive kudos to our security researcher and resident binary ninja* [***Matthew Brennan***](https://twitter.com/embee_research) *for this deep-dive!Â*

This backdoored **ffmpeg.dll** primarily acts as loader for the **d3dcompiler\_47.dll** file.

Right from the DLL entrypoint, it eventually enters a new function (that we have renamed **mw\_main\_function** for our reverse engineering purposes) --

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dc9_doZeBsK0VRhzyj4ypq1pFejcXq8qWg_iNCEIcyVeQuKB5CIAJG9TWCh5rDrEZnSPkMDC42t-TAKOiYQ_JGVajmzs_cws4EP3zGOVJkTG2puUbsRfmQ1O9x5HPQ8OQ_lciHjoQZzGQAE321_-OWGiBvI.png)

That creates a new event **AVMonitorRefreshEvent**, resolves the current file path, and looks for the subsequent **d3dcompiler\_47.dll** file to load into memory.

From our analysis, we see **d3dcompiler\_47.dll** ***is*** signed by Microsoft, but contains an embedded secondary encrypted payload. This payload is denoted by a specific byte marker, **FE ED FA CE**, [as others have also observed](https://twitter.com/dez_/status/1641204732445478912).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd3_4Bz7F4yHhZWUCKo8kxqR9o2PvtMGpQIdZk9wTp7wgNqEXC84eEaZaSKt12lHuuQ7S3qqFaveQpiypLNVhqiO84UYCc39Eu0Um7QGzIsEIWxSS8WYxk2vILvWWViQ16VhExlzU6bAcSu6Ko-PvvWoWUg.png)

After retrieving **d3dcompiler\_47.dll**, the **ffmpeg.dll** binary locates and unravels this secondary payload by decrypting an RC4 stream with the key **3jB(2bsG#@c7**. According to other threat intelligence, this static key is known to be attributed to DPRK threat actors.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dca_image-png-Mar-30-2023-09-42-25-8012-AM.png)

Following calls to **VirtualProtect** to prepare this payload, we could extract the decrypted shellcode for further examination.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd8_Iy6CWsIDRDhTNm8DUdOLcXQl8zWq69ywhE6Wl-kKxoXH9wAU6C-p-ub_QXKlaMvd5j7P_eoffw7yPp8Wd5BYJOqL_3vx1EoIy-2aRkRW3odcXCJlVKAZoh6oDy85q6D3hHpT790eTnCGhlwgAOR3CHA.png)

Digging further within GHIDRA, x64dbg and other analysis tools, we discovered there is yet another DLL file embedded within the shellcode. It appears this shellcode is just another PE loader.

One very important note regarding this shellcode-embedded PE file: **it would sleep for 7 days and wait to call out to external C2 servers**. The 7-day delay is peculiar, as you may not have seen further indicators immediately... and it may explain why some users have not yet seen malicious activity. (Perhaps an interesting observation considering these new malicious 3CX updates were first seen on March 22, and the industry caught wind of this malicious activity on March 29)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd4_Gfx8awdo5MEfJPgnXuZc9KRFMayikJyAePwsmUd7fK1M7LyMNn46AQNJWZaZQ3eEN1HDINI8iM8A4JmOUthdm-qTbAGDRoIqu-1F7Q5YrAMydRzitn6fI-vMDXxioIGQNddDZ5Xrf80SFBxwKBC62JM.png)

This final PE file ultimately reaches out to a Github repository and raw file contents:

**https://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/IconStorages/images/main/icon%d.ico**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dc8_image%2520(1)-png.png)

This Github repository, **https[:]//github[.]com/IconStorages/images**, stored 16 separate .**ICO** icon files.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd0_KVNPHbgErJ-KGkcU0aQWpH_v8-SnXpM71ZVl6raiaQced8_9d1Zq73uICfP0bcuskIuAtqzuRsqkcahP8fouoXigS_Nt61LjSRGyBZ7ULway42q0dqglXNxDbAzhldp9Nk_SkZND48Bstsl2cLkeoEk.png)

Each one was in fact a valid icon file, however, **at the very end of each file was a Base64 encoded string.**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296de0_iA8Q-dPDmXH5bINbu-I_lcqb9ZVZSY5nUZU6jEVAVUqCMYMsd3gWw6al7VCYfMuLSf7BqPc0vNK2UQORnWu-JkI11uhsjT6a8xMvnWCom_-_IP6nFoDPXT-0qrnU2PAQF9bVDUc6zL3okOaFx-C9vFU.png)

Attempting to decode these Base64 strings, they were -- as we might expect -- seemingly more encrypted data.Â

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dd1_bUXJF_mZb-5XhzFa7rWvH3IcfmZ9iyemT_C3888KHG4V-WZZWUQgmZYAX3f0v6IufBXFZ0utfY5mnGO8ZWOk9dYDwTfn_6EgmoMPCz3gJtp7uRj8Ij6LdYnWd8iPs0X-_C644I67tz1MKuIY0OECLFg.png)

In between the internet HTTP requests to Github, we observed decryption routines. These helped clue in how we could decrypt what looked to be AES encrypted data -- ultimately unraveling to these plaintext strings and URLs referenced at the end of each **.ICO** file:

**https[:]//www[.]3cx[.]com/blog/event-trainings/https[:]//akamaitechcloudservices[.]com/v2/storagehttps[:]//akamaitechcloudservices[.]com/v2/storagehttps[:]//azureonlinestorage[.]com/azure/storagehttps[:]//msedgepackageinfo[.]com/microsoft-edgehttps[:]//glcloudservice[.]com/v1/consolehttps[:]//pbxsources[.]com/exchangehttps[:]//msstorageazure[.]com/windowhttps[:]//officestoragebox[.]com/api/sessionhttps[:]//visualstudiofactory[.]com/workloadhttps[:]//azuredeploystore[.]com/cloud/serviceshttps[:]//msstorageboxes[.]com/officehttps[:]//officeaddons[.]com/technologieshttps[:]//sourceslabs[.]com/downloadshttps[:]//zacharryblogs[.]com/feedhttps[:]//pbxcloudeservices[.]com/phonesystemhttps[:]//pbxphonenetwork[.]com/voiphttps[:]//msedgeupdate[.]net/Windows**

These URLs match the same handful of domain IOCs shared by others. The final payload would randomly choose which icon number, and ultimately decrypted URL, to be selected as the external C2 server.

Interestingly enough, the very first **.ICO** file, **icon0.ico** had pointed to **https[:]//www[.]3cx[.]com/blog/event-trainings/** ... however trawling through the past commits of the IconStorage Github repository, it originally referenced **https[:]//msedgeupdate[.]net/Windows**

The **https[:]//github[.]com/IconStorages/images** repository hosting these C2 server endpoints [**has been taken offline**](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1641270384023719937). While this may hinder the execution of hosts updating to the current malicious version of 3CX, the real impact is unknown at this time. It is not yet clear whether or not adversaries still have access to the 3CX supply chain in order to poison future updates - perhaps this may change the tradecraft we see in the coming days.

Right now I see the github[.]com/IconStorages/images repository included in the 3CX supply chain attack has now been taken down.

I reported the user to Github earlier today. [pic.twitter.com/ltWen5TnLo](https://t.co/ltWen5TnLo)

We have not yet seen any sample network data communicating with these C2 URLs for us to analyze.

## Detection Efforts

**UPDATE 3/30/23 @ 2pm ET: Our team has created a** [**PowerShell script**](https://github.com/huntresslabs/threat-intel/blob/main/2023/2023-03/30-3CX/tools/Check-3cxVulnerability.ps1) **that can be used to check locations/versions of 3CX to run against the hashes and see if they're bad to be run in an RMM.Â**

Windows Defender is currently detecting this attack chain with the threat name [**Trojan:Win64/SamScissors**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win64/SamScissors).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296de2_jfkc9My5x2OzhvOoMLhNy1PM5VQ_zL5HIsXhinfL4eQ7OKl3P5CoQqyySRvahSJ6ideN2hFLuo5d8UlfwB1nkhJZ5zm5Nxj9PwkS-aH4irqs3ySxc5iCjijgvHF719l8AALImGPlFkED9gYW4aoIOl4.png)

For detection efforts, Huntress has observed -- at least for the malicious initial outreach to Github-related IP address -- a particular process tree and process command line:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296dda_QcrDl1KLeXhNYbovEUF3dm0Xh8q_L4WrwI5VilNesFUBvJ8e-jmyO2dnSAzuw-gq5Rs0_BXaG6oMbygX0iQFm1NmZ_P-0b0QC3MacV8Yor0PThqi0S8uLZCc3pEHyrGAXfmvlxBX5ZhcoweIi6M6oN0.png)

The parent lineage has been:Â

**explorer.exe** \\_**3CXDesktopApp.exe** \\_  **3CXDesktopApp.exe**

â¦ with the *parent* **3CXDesktopApp.exe** having one of the known malicious hashes, and the corresponding child **3CXDesktopApp.exe** invoked with a command line of:

**[DRIVE]:\Users\Username\Local\Programs\3CXDesktopApp.exe\3CXDesktopApp.exe autoLaunch**

To note, we *have* observed processes with this lineage and command line that *have not* reached out to a Github related domain... but the distinguishing factor appears to be the process lineage criteria paired with the malicious hashes for the parent **3CXDesktopApp.exe**.

These known SHA256 hashes offer quality indicators:

* **a60a61bf844bc181d4540c9fac53203250a982e7c3ad6153869f01e19cc36203** (18.12.416)
* **5d99efa36f34aa6b43cd81e77544961c5c8d692c96059fef92c2df2624550734** (18.12.416)
* **54004dfaa48ca5fa91e3304fb99559a2395301c570026450882d6aad89132a02** (18.12.407)
* **d45674f941be3cca2fbc1af42778043cc18cd86d95a2ecb9e6f0e212ed4c74ae** (18.12.407)

Additionally, Huntress researcher [Matthew Brennan](https://twitter.com/embee_research) has crafted a YARA rule to help detect these malicious files.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296de3_jqU_TROyhY5WDH3InSc7rPu9McsNEq36rX79G-D0USxq8AbI_MtOyLrGuBx14MtUwFX_qJwTnYp9Cv82yJR5o0Lt2_C-kKXF-ZqLdJuKfHnr3oIEg6Cz-dDKEZkpsozwVI8g3Bf6J98m2bnRWJHABJ8.png)

You can find this YARA rule included within this [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/b9912e2d2ba4418a8a4450a166b35cb4):

## Attribution

While definitive attribution is not yet clear, the current consensus across the security community is that this attack was performed by a DPRK nation-state threat actor.

## 3CX Official Messaging

The latest recommendations [from the 3CX CEO](https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/3cx-desktopapp-security-alert.119951/) and [CISO](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/desktopapp-security-alert/) are to **uninstall the desktop client for 3CX**. They report they are preparing a new release and update to the 3CXDesktopApp to be made available soon.

## Huntress Assistance

Fully aware of the severity of this incident, we realize our efforts are just one pebble in the pond. With that said, our goal is always to keep our partners safe and do as much as we can to help the broader small and mid-size business (SMB) community prevent this from escalating further.

If you are using 3CX and arenât already working with our team, Huntress is offering a free, 30-day trial of our Managed EDR services through the month of April. For more information, check out the details here:Â [https://www.huntress.com/3cx-response.](https://www.huntress.com/3cx-response)

# More Supply Chain Attacks via New Malicious Python Packages in PyPi

By
[Jin Lee](/blog/search?author=Jin+Lee)

 | February 21, 2023

The FortiGuard Labs team has discovered another 0-day attack in the PyPI packages (Python Package Index) by the [malware author](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-malware)s ‘Portugal’ and ‘Brazil’ who published the packages ‘xhttpsp’ and ‘httpssp’. These two packages were discovered on January 31, 2023, by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. They were both published on January 27, 2023. Each included one version and an empty description, as shown below.

Figure 6: Package release history of ‘httpssp’

The two packages included the same malicious code in their setup.py installation script, which appears to be encoded with Base64.

![Figure 7: setup.py script](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1752919868.img.png/1675756387798/fig7-setup-py-script.png)

Figure 7: setup.py script

When we decoded the encoded string, we found python code, some of which are shown below.

![Figure 8: Decoded string](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_744108577.img.png/1675756436037/fig8-decoded-string.png)

Figure 8: Decoded string

Within the string, we find an interesting URL, ‘http://54[.]237[.]36[.]60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx', which the malware reads and then writes to a file to execute.

This URL has not previously been detected by any other threat researchers.

![Figure 9: The URL has not been detected by VirusTotal](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_355870222.img.png/1675756485928/fig9-url-not-detected-virustotal.png)

Figure 9: The URL has not been detected by VirusTotal

When accessing the URL, we found heavily obfuscated code, shown below.

![Figure 10: Contents of the URL ‘http://54[.]237[.]36[.]60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx’](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_338434604.img.png/1675756548802/fig10-content-url-sj535bx.png)

Figure 10: Contents of the URL ‘http://54[.]237[.]36[.]60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx’

When we execute the decoded code from Figure 8, we notice that it drops a file to an arbitrary location with a random name and extension. This may be due to changes in the code every time the URL is refreshed. In this case, it drops the file to ‘%USER%\AppData\Local\Temp’ as ‘yzulmvnb.jpg’ and sets a registry key for auto-run.

![Figure 11: Dropped file](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1618470116.img.png/1675756603482/fig11-dropped-file.png)

Figure 11: Dropped file

![Figure 12: Autorun set at startup](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1925235464.img.png/1675756629364/fig12-autorun-set-at-startup.png)

Figure 12: Autorun set at startup

When examining the dropped file, we observe that it is another script similar to the one shown in the URL contents.

![Figure 13: Contents of the dropped file](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_2043774597.img.png/1675756670094/fig13-contents-of-dropped-file.png)

Figure 13: Contents of the dropped file

Let’s try executing this dropped file.

![Figure 14: Dropped file running](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1454958900.img.png/1675756711857/fig14-dropped-file-running.png)

Figure 14: Dropped file running

One suspicious behavior when executing this file is that it drops a binary executable file to the ‘%USER%’ folder as ‘update.exe’.

![Figure 15: Dropped executable file update.exe](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_862382582.img.png/1675756757609/fig15-dropped-executable-file-update.png)

Figure 15: Dropped executable file update.exe

A handful of vendors flag this dropped executable file as malicious (SHA 256):

*618c11e03328eb0cc47ac21964479901dfaaa8a038e4145e247374169d6528f9*

![Figure 16: Vendors that detect the dropped executable file update.exe](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1997898193.img.png/1675756820227/fig16-vendors-that-detect-dropped-executable-file-update.png)

Figure 16: Vendors that detect the dropped executable file update.exe

As shown in Figure 14, it then runs a Powershell, which is another suspicious behavior. It also copies itself to ‘%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Google’ as ‘Chrome.exe’ and sets autorun for this copied executable.

![Figure 17: Dropped copy as Chrome.exe](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1664356108.img.png/1675756864982/fig17-dropped-copy-chrome.png)

Figure 17: Dropped copy as Chrome.exe

![Figure 18: Autorun set at startup for Chrome.exe](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_394976173.img.png/1675756885229/fig18-autorun-set-startup-chrome.png)

Figure 18: Autorun set at startup for Chrome.exe

When we dive into the ‘update.exe’ code, we see a binary embedded within it, as shown below.

![Figure 19: Snippet of code of binary embedded in update.exe in dnSpy](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_665823132.img.png/1675756930002/fig19-code-snippet-binary-embedded-update.png)

Figure 19: Snippet of code of binary embedded in update.exe in dnSpy

![Figure 20: Snippet of code of update.exe in dnSpy](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_26964475.img.png/1675756954456/fig20-snippet-code-update-dnspy.png)

Figure 20: Snippet of code of update.exe in dnSpy

The embedded binary is a .dll file. As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, many vendors flag this binary, ‘Rdudkye.dll,’ as malicious (SHA 256):

*19e9dbfe9df33f17664e780909054b48c62d3dd66e11f31f3a657d18ac4c752f*

![Figure 21: Vendors that detect the binary Rdudkye.dll](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_1624913488.img.png/1675756994310/fig21-vendors-detect-rdudkye.png)

Figure 21: Vendors that detect the binary Rdudkye.dll

While the code is very obfuscated, some functions give clues about what it may do or its capabilities. We can see some interesting functions such as DiscordApi, TelegramApi, Inject, ProcessHollowing, RemoteThreadInjection, HiddenStartup, etc.

![Figure 22: Snippet of functions of Rdudkye.dll in dnSpy](/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/image_825741058.img.png/1675757031723/fig22-snippet-functions-rdudkye-dnspy.png)

Figure 22: Snippet of functions of Rdudkye.dll in dnSpy

This blog shows that although the malicious python script may appear simple, it is more complex than it seems with multiple layers. With just a simple copy and paste of a brief code, malware authors are able to easily distribute malicious packages to steal or exfiltrate sensitive data through platforms such as Discord and Telegram. A good indication of a malicious package is when a lot of obfuscation is involved. This technique is quite common among malware authors, so it may be a wise idea for Python end users to check twice for this before using new packages.

[Security Operations](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/category/security-operations/) [Threat Research](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/category/threat-research/) [3cx](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/3cx/) [CVE-2023-29059](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/cve-2023-29059/) [d3dcompiler\_47.dll](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/d3dcompiler_47-dll/) [DLL sideloading](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/dll-sideloading/) [featured](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/featured/) [ffmpeg.dll](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/ffmpeg-dll/) [IOC Hunting](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/ioc-hunting/)

Sophos X-Ops is tracking a developing situation concerning a seeming supply-chain attack, possibly undertaken by a nation-state-related group. This page provides an overview of the situation, a threat analysis, information for hunters, and information on detection protection.

We will update this page as events and understanding develop, including our threat and detection guidance.

*[Latest version published 02:00 UTC 06-April-23, adding detections; included analysis notes re infostealer seeking config.json in the 3CX application and re three files dropped by libffmpeg.dylib; adjusted language re OSX/PWS-CMV detection*

 *23:00* *UTC 01-April-23, adding Troj/Steal-DLG to Detection Protections/Static detection, two more queries customers may use to determine their exposure to the attack, new analysis of an emergent line of inquiry concerning a timestamp mechanism in the malicious code, and information on analysis of other Electron-built apps using ffmpeg.dll*

*23:30 UTC 30-March-23, adding detail on affected versions, misuse of ffmpeg.dll, removal of malicious repository, comparison of PE shellcode loader to that used by Lazarus threat group, more queries customers may use to determine their exposure to the attack, and various additional detections]*

## **Overview**

The affected software is 3CX – a legitimate software-based PBX phone system available on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Some Windows and MacOS versions of the application have been abused by the threat actor to add an installer that communicates with various command-and-control (C2) servers.

The software is a digitally signed version of the softphone desktop client for both Windows and MacOS, which includes a malicious payload. According to 3CX, their Update 7 for Windows, version numbers 18.12.407 and 18.12.416, and Electron Mac App version numbers 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 and 18.12.416, are affected. The most common post-exploitation event we have observed to date is the presence of an infostealer that targets the browser(s) on a compromised system. At this writing, 3CX has deprecated the affected versions of the Windows application.

At present, the only platforms confirmed by our customer data to be affected are Windows and MacOS, which is in agreement with 3CX’s information on affected platforms. According to [information](https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/3cx-desktopapp-security-alert.119951/) on their support forum, Android and iOS versions of the software are not believed to be affected.

NIST tracks this issue as [CVE-2023-29059](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29059).

## **Threat analysis**

On March 22, users of 3CX began discussion of potential false-positive detections of 3CXDesktopApp by their endpoint security agents.

[![The compromise as it happened](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3cx-compromise-in-action.jpg)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3cx-compromise-in-action.jpg)

*Figure 1: The update process at the moment the malicious version drops*

Sophos MDR first identified malicious activity directed at its own customers and stemming from 3CXDesktopApp on March 29, 2023. Additionally, Sophos MDR has observed the campaign leveraging a public file storage to host encoded malware. This repository has been in use since December 8, 2022; after news of the compromise spread widely on March 29, the repository was taken down.

The attack revolves around a DLL sideloading scenario, one with a remarkable number of components involved. This is likely to ensure that customers were able to use the 3CX desktop package without noticing anything unusual about the affected package. We have identified three crucial components:

* 3CXDesktopApp.exe, the clean loader
* d3dcompiler\_47.dll, a DLL with an appended encrypted payload
* ffmpeg.dll, a Trojanized loader

Figure 2 presents a high-level look at the attack flow as it works in Windows; there are some minor variations in the later steps with the MacOS version.

[![A flow chart showing the complexity of the attack](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-02-3.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-02-3.png)

*Figure 2: A high-level view of the attack flow*

The file ffmpeg.dll contains an embedded URL which is used to retrieve a malicious encoded .ico payload from GitHub file storage at https[:]//raw.githubusercontent.com/IconStorages/images/main/ — though, again, once news of the compromise spread widely, this repository was taken down.

We saw several variations on the ffmpeg.dll file, including one that was signed by 3CX’s own certificate; these appear to be maliciously patched versions of the legitimate ffmpeg.dll. In a statement on Thursday, the team responsible for ffmpeg’s source code took pains to distance their work from the 3CX compromise.

[![A snapshot of the tweet from ffmpeg, which says "There have been several incorrect reports that FFmpeg has been involved in the distribution of malware. FFmpeg only provides source code and the source code has not been compromised. Any "ffmpeg.dll" that has been compromised is the responsibility of the vendor. "](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.png)

*Figure 3: When ffmpeg stepped onto Twitter to defend its code*

In a normal DLL sideloading scenario, the malicious loader (ffmpeg.dll) would replace the clean dependency; its only function would be to queue up the payload. However, in this case, that loader is also entirely functional, as it would normally be in the 3CX product – instead, there’s an additional payload inserted at the DllMain function. Appending malicious code in this fashion adds bulk, but may have lowered suspicions – the abused 3CX application functions as expected, even as the Trojan addresses reached out to the C2 beacon.

As part of our analysis, we also did a comparison of the ffmpeg.dll in 3CX with the same file in other Electron apps. Our analysis has shown only the 3CX ffmpeg.dll contains the malicious code. We conclude from this that this compromise does not affect other Electron apps — only the 3CX ffmpeg.dll.

*Figure 4: What the affected 3CX developers and customers experienced*

Allowing the abused software to remain functional is not dissimilar to other DLL sideloading cases we’ve seen, but this campaign is slightly different even from the current rash of DLL sideloading cases we’ve seen. In particular, we’ve noted that the PE shellcode loader in use is unique in our experience. Previous to this, we’ve only seen it in incidents attributed to the Lazarus group; the code in this incident is a byte-to-byte match to those previous samples.

We observed that the stealer component also checks for the presence of a specific file, \3CXDesktopApp\config.json. It is not yet clear why it checks for this file.

On the MacOS side, we note three files dropped by the malicious libffmpeg.dylib as notable traces:

* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.session-lock
* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.main\_storage
* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent

### TimeStamp Check Analysis

As part of our ongoing investigation, we found a timestamp mechanism in the code as shown below.

[![](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-6-Collecting-the-cbData.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-6-Collecting-the-cbData.png)

*Figure 5: A timestamp mechanism in the code*

Looking at this, we can see a while loop that calls the check\_timestamp function and receives a 64-bit integer value from GetSystemTimeAsFileTime Api call. The results of check\_timestamp are evaluated against “v6,” a variable which holds the value coming from cbData.  cbData is collected from the “manifest” file as shown below.

[![](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-5-A-timestamp-mechanism-in-the-code.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-5-A-timestamp-mechanism-in-the-code.png)

*Figure 6: Collecting the cbData*

“manifest” is a file that the malware writes to the system under the “3cxdesktopapp” folder during the initial stage of the infection. When the manifest is created, a dword value is written based on the current timestamp, with additional arithmetic operations performed on it.

The above code checks if manifest exists and is writeable; if so, then it adds 7 days + the current system timestamp + rand() generated number % 21 days. In other words, the value can be up to a total of 28 days ahead. Otherwise, it just reads the existing value from the manifest file.

So long as the results of check\_timestamp are less than v6 (the timestamp value from manifest), the loop continues to sleep. Only once the results of check\_timestamp are greater than the manifest timestamp will the code proceed and generate the HTTP request to connect with GitHub, which initiates the payload download.

            OR LOWER(http_user_agent) LIKE '%3cxdesktopapp/18.11.1197%'    )
```

We also recommend that users of 3CX’s software continue to monitor the company’s communications channels; they have a [blog](https://www.3cx.com/blog/) and also a support-and-information [forum](https://www.3cx.com/community/forums/webrtc-webclient/). As of March 30, the company was recommending that customers uninstall and reinstall the app, and suggested that they might also use the company’s browser-based PWA client while the situation was sorted out.

On March 31, 3CX noted that Google has [invalidated](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/chrome-blocks-latest-msi/) the company’s previous signing certificate, which means both the originally infected MSI files plus files issued by 3CX earlier in the week using that certificate will be blocked, and issued a fresh one. 3CX at this writing is building entirely new MSI installers using the newly issued certificate. This applies to Windows only, as the company states they will not be rebuilding the Mac version of the desktop app yet while they focus on the Windows version (and on the security breach in general).

An updated list of IOCs for this attack is published [on our GitHub](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs).

## **Detection protection**

SophosLabs has blocked the malicious domains and published the following detections:

Static detections:

* Troj/Loader-AF (Trojanized ffmpeg.dll)
* Troj/Mdrop-JTQ (installers)
* Troj/Steal-DLG
* OSX/Mdrop-JTR (installers)
* OSX/Loader-AG (Trojanized libffmpeg.dylib)

Reputation detection:

* Mal/Generic-R / Mal/Generic-S (d3dcompiler with appended shellcode)

Memory detection:

* Mem/Loader-AH

We have also blocked the list of known C2 domains associated with the threat and will continue to add to that list in the IOC file [on our GitHub](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs), as noted above. Finally, the two malicious versions of the ffmpeg.dll bundled in the affected 3CX application are flagged by their hashes as being of low reputation.

SophosLabs is actively investigating additional detection opportunities for activity stemming from this software. In addition, for customers of Sophos MDR, the MDR Detection Engineering team has a variety of behavioral detections in place that will detect follow up activity.

With over 15 years of experience, Loman and his team really understand modern computer systems and applications. Their goal is simple: To make it difficult for the bad guys who want to sneak into computers, mess with how apps work, or lock up your files. They achieve this with security measures that safeguard documents and secrets, and by making swift adjustments to the computer's inner workings, which significantly increases the difficulty for anyone trying to cause trouble. Among his many other Sophos projects, he is the co-creator of CryptoGuard.

Hi,

The query //2. Determining whether hosts have interacted with malicious files// throws an error

403 : “{“error”:”forbiddenAccess”,”message”:”Access denied for table”,”correlationId”:”1a408627-123b-49f9-a624-08cf5384574f”,”code”:null,”createdAt”:”2023-04-03T09:42:50.338Z”,”requestId”:null,”docUrl”:null}”

any idea how to fix this?

Thanks

Emanuel

Hello Emanuel – thanks for commenting. We’ve taken a look and here’s what we saw:

Query 2 is a Live Endpoint query that must be run against selected endpoints when they are online. We were able to replicate that error when running the query incorrectly against the data lake. Changing the source to Live Endpoint and then selecting the online endpoints will allow it to run.

Hope that helps.

# Supply Chain Attacks: Examples And Countermeasures

## What Is A Supply Chain Attack?

A supply chain attack refers to when someone uses an outside provider or partner that has access to your data and systems to infiltrate your digital infrastructure. Because the outside party has been granted the rights to use and manipulate areas of your network, your applications, or sensitive data, the attacker only has to either penetrate the third party’s defenses or program a loophole into a solution offered by a vendor to infiltrate your system.

Supply chain attacks are diverse, impacting large companies, as was the case with the Target security breach, and typically dependable systems, like when automated teller machine (ATM) [malware](/resources/cyberglossary/malware) is used to steal cash. They have also been used against governments, as was the case with the Stuxnet [computer worm](/resources/cyberglossary/worm-virus), which was designed to infiltrate Iran’s nuclear facilities.

## Sources Of Supply Chain Attacks

Some of the most common sources of supply chain attacks are commercial software, open-source supply chains, and foreign products.

### Commercial software products

Because hundreds or even thousands of companies may use the same software vendor and solutions, if a supply chain attacker can penetrate a software company’s system or compromise the integrity of their product, they can gain access to a great number of targets.

If hackers are able to install malicious code into software that companies purchase, for instance, they do not have to go through the trouble of hacking the company’s system. Hackers may also try to gain access to penetration tools that software security providers give their clients and use these to gain a foothold in their network.

One way attackers have been able to compromise software is by using compiler attacks. A compiler translates code written in one language into a different programming language. In a compiler attack, the compiler is used to insert malicious code into the translation it produces.

### Open-source supply chains

With open-source software solutions, anyone can contribute to the development of a program. Using this free access, hackers have programmed vulnerabilities into open-source solutions, making it easy for them to introduce threat to companies that use the software produced.

Even though other members of the development community can see and evaluate the solution produced by perpetrators, they may not know what to look for, allowing hackers to introduce a variety of vulnerabilities.

### Foreign-sourced threats

In countries like China, where the government can exercise deep, granular control over what private companies produce, software products may contain malicious code that the government demanded the producer to include.

The inclusion of these threats does not have to be sanctioned by the government, either. Malicious actors can infiltrate companies and sneak their code into otherwise legitimate products. When these are purchased by other countries, hackers on the other side of the border can have full access to sensitive systems.

## How Do Supply Chain Attacks Work?

For a supply chain attack to work, hackers have to insert malicious code into software or find ways to compromise network protocols or components. Once they discover a hacking opportunity, they take advantage of it, gaining access to critical digital resources.

The fact that many of the products that get compromised come from trusted vendors makes it easier for supply chain attackers to penetrate their targets’ systems. They may do so using an application or one of its updates, which, ironically, are often designed to close security loopholes.

## Types Of Supply Chain Attacks

There are several kinds of supply chain attacks, all of which involve creating or taking advantage of security weaknesses in solutions companies trust. They include:

1. **Stolen certificates**. If a hacker steals a certificate used to vouch for the legitimacy or safety of a company’s product, they can peddle malicious code under the guise of that company’s certificate.
2. **Compromised software development tools or infrastructure**. Hackers leverage the tools for building software applications to introduce security weaknesses in the development process—even before the process is used to create an application.
3. **Malware preinstalled on devices**. Hackers put malware on phones, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, cameras, and other mobile devices, and when the target connects it to their system or network, malicious code gets introduced.
4. **Code included in the firmware of components**. Digital hardware is controlled by firmware that helps it run smoothly and interface with users and other systems. Hackers can include malicious code in firmware to gain access to a system or network.

## Examples Of Supply Chain Attacks

Hackers’ attacks on supply chains have recently resulted in several high-profile incidents. In each of the following  supply chain attack examples, the systems or software of trusted vendors were compromised.

### Dependency confusion, 2021

A security researcher was able [to breach](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-hacks-apple-microsoft-and-other-major-tech-companies-in-novel-supply-chain-attack) Microsoft, Uber, Apple, and Tesla. The researcher, Alex Birsan, took advantage of dependencies that applications use to provide services to end-users. Through these dependencies, Birsan was able to transmit counterfeit yet harmless data packets to high-profile users.

### Mimecast, 2021

In the [Mimecast attack](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/), hackers were able to compromise a security certificate that authenticates Mimecast's services on Microsoft 365 Exchange Web Services. While only a relative few were impacted, about 10% of Mimecast’s customers use apps that rely on the certificate that had been compromised.

### SolarWinds, 2020

The [SolarWinds attack](https://www.fortiguard.com/outbreak-alert/solarwinds) was orchestrated by injecting a backdoor, known as SUNBURST, into the Orion IT update tool. The backdoor had been downloaded by 18,000 customers.

### ASUS, 2018

The attack on ASUS, [according to Symantec researchers](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/asus-supply-chain-attack), took advantage of an update feature and impacted as many as 500,000 systems. In the attack, an automatic update was used to introduce malware to users’ systems.

### Event-stream, 2018

In the [event-stream attack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/), a repository within the GitHub system was injected with malware. The dependency in the repository containing the malware was accessed by an unknown number of applications. GitHub, while not open source, serves as a backup service to the public, and users are encouraged to share their solutions with others.

## Best Practices Against Chain Attacks

To fight supply chain attacks, companies can integrate a number of techniques, ranging from addressing issues with their general cybersecurity infrastructure to ensuring endpoints are secured against infiltration.

### 1. Audit unapproved shadow IT infrastructure

With[shadow IT](/resources/cyberglossary/shadow-it), the services used by employees are not overseen by the IT department. These can range from security software to communication tools and more. Auditing these may reveal vulnerabilities that supply chain hackers can take advantage of.

### 2. Have an updated and effective software asset inventory in place

Each software asset, regardless of how useful it is, introduces a potential vulnerability. With an updated inventory of all the software your company uses, you can better track which apps, updates, and upgrades may present security issues. You can also narrow down the number of potential [attack vectors](/resources/cyberglossary/attack-vector) by categorizing your solutions according to how safe they are.

### 3. Assess a vendor's security posture

If you ensure each vendor provides a full description of their security measures, you can get an idea of how safe their products are. You can also have a cybersecurity professional examine the information vendors provide to see if what they have in place is adequate.

### 4. Treat validation of supplier risk as an ongoing process

A supplier may be safe in Q1 but the source of an attack in Q2. Evaluate the risk presented by each supplier continuously, periodically verifying the safety of each one.

### 5. Use client-side protection tools

In a client-server model, users download data provided by a server. With client-side protection tools, you can filter downloaded content, looking for—and stopping—malicious code before it gets installed on a machine on your network.

### 6. Use endpoint detection and response tools

Supply chain cyberattacks often take advantage of inadequately secured endpoints. With an [endpoint detection and response (EDR)](/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-edr) system, many types of supply chain attacks can be stopped because the endpoint itself is protected against infection. As a result, the endpoint also cannot be used to spread an attack to other areas of your network.

### 7. Deploy strong code integrity policies to allow only authorized apps to run

Code dependency policies consist of rules that dictate whether or not an application is allowed to run. If the code of the application raises a red flag, the system blocks it. Maintaining a strict set of code dependency policies can limit the number of supply chain attacks your company encounters.

In some cases, setting up strict rules may cause legitimate apps to be flagged, but it is always better to be safe than sorry. Invest a little extra time investigating flagged apps.

### 8. Maintain a highly secure build and update infrastructure

To ensure the builds and updates of your system are secure, have a system in place for regularly installing security patches for your operating systems and the software you run. Also, make sure that only trusted tools can be run on your system. Require [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/resources/cyberglossary/multi-factor-authentication) for admins.

### 9. Build secure software updates as part of the software development life cycle

To ensure secure updaters are a key element of your life cycle, you can:

1. Make secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption mandatory.
2. Require that everything is signed with a digital signature, including scripts, files, packages, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) files.
3. Do not let software accept generic, unsigned input or commands.

### 10. Develop an incident response process

Your incident response process should be systematic and incorporate honest and transparent information dissemination. This includes letting internal stakeholders and customers know—in a timely manner—when something has happened, as well as the cause and steps taken to mitigate the problem.

## Supply Chain Attack FAQs

### How do supply chain attacks work?

For a supply chain attack to work, hackers have to insert malicious code into software or find ways to compromise network protocols or components. Once malicious actors discover a hacking opportunity, they take advantage of it, gaining access to critical digital resources.

### What is a supply chain attack?

A supply chain attack refers to when someone uses an outside provider or partner that has access to your data and systems to infiltrate your digital infrastructure.

### How can supply chain attacks be prevented?

You can prevent supply chain attacks if you:

1. Audit unapproved shadow IT infrastructure
2. Have an updated and effective software asset inventory in place
3. Assess vendors' security posture
4. Treat validation of supplier risk as an ongoing process
5. Use client-side protection tools
6. Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
7. Deploy strong code integrity policies to allow only authorized apps to run
8. Maintain a highly secure build and update infrastructure
9. Build secure software updaters as part of the software development life cycle
10. Develop an incident response process

### How do you detect a supply chain attack?

You can detect a supply chain attack using a monitoring system that flags abnormal behavior on devices and within applications and systems.

[March 29, 2023](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/03/29/3cx-dll-sideloading-attack/)
[Security Operations](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/category/security-operations/) [Threat Research](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/category/threat-research/) [3cx](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/3cx/) [CVE-2023-29059](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/cve-2023-29059/) [d3dcompiler\_47.dll](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/d3dcompiler_47-dll/) [DLL sideloading](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/dll-sideloading/) [featured](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/featured/) [ffmpeg.dll](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/ffmpeg-dll/) [IOC Hunting](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/tag/ioc-hunting/)

Sophos X-Ops is tracking a developing situation concerning a seeming supply-chain attack, possibly undertaken by a nation-state-related group. This page provides an overview of the situation, a threat analysis, information for hunters, and information on detection protection.

We will update this page as events and understanding develop, including our threat and detection guidance.

*[Latest version published 02:00 UTC 06-April-23, adding detections; included analysis notes re infostealer seeking config.json in the 3CX application and re three files dropped by libffmpeg.dylib; adjusted language re OSX/PWS-CMV detection*

 *23:00* *UTC 01-April-23, adding Troj/Steal-DLG to Detection Protections/Static detection, two more queries customers may use to determine their exposure to the attack, new analysis of an emergent line of inquiry concerning a timestamp mechanism in the malicious code, and information on analysis of other Electron-built apps using ffmpeg.dll*

*23:30 UTC 30-March-23, adding detail on affected versions, misuse of ffmpeg.dll, removal of malicious repository, comparison of PE shellcode loader to that used by Lazarus threat group, more queries customers may use to determine their exposure to the attack, and various additional detections]*

## **Overview**

The affected software is 3CX – a legitimate software-based PBX phone system available on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Some Windows and MacOS versions of the application have been abused by the threat actor to add an installer that communicates with various command-and-control (C2) servers.

The software is a digitally signed version of the softphone desktop client for both Windows and MacOS, which includes a malicious payload. According to 3CX, their Update 7 for Windows, version numbers 18.12.407 and 18.12.416, and Electron Mac App version numbers 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 and 18.12.416, are affected. The most common post-exploitation event we have observed to date is the presence of an infostealer that targets the browser(s) on a compromised system. At this writing, 3CX has deprecated the affected versions of the Windows application.

At present, the only platforms confirmed by our customer data to be affected are Windows and MacOS, which is in agreement with 3CX’s information on affected platforms. According to [information](https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/3cx-desktopapp-security-alert.119951/) on their support forum, Android and iOS versions of the software are not believed to be affected.

NIST tracks this issue as [CVE-2023-29059](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29059).

## **Threat analysis**

On March 22, users of 3CX began discussion of potential false-positive detections of 3CXDesktopApp by their endpoint security agents.

[![The compromise as it happened](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3cx-compromise-in-action.jpg)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3cx-compromise-in-action.jpg)

*Figure 1: The update process at the moment the malicious version drops*

Sophos MDR first identified malicious activity directed at its own customers and stemming from 3CXDesktopApp on March 29, 2023. Additionally, Sophos MDR has observed the campaign leveraging a public file storage to host encoded malware. This repository has been in use since December 8, 2022; after news of the compromise spread widely on March 29, the repository was taken down.

The attack revolves around a DLL sideloading scenario, one with a remarkable number of components involved. This is likely to ensure that customers were able to use the 3CX desktop package without noticing anything unusual about the affected package. We have identified three crucial components:

* 3CXDesktopApp.exe, the clean loader
* d3dcompiler\_47.dll, a DLL with an appended encrypted payload
* ffmpeg.dll, a Trojanized loader

Figure 2 presents a high-level look at the attack flow as it works in Windows; there are some minor variations in the later steps with the MacOS version.

[![A flow chart showing the complexity of the attack](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-02-3.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-02-3.png)

*Figure 2: A high-level view of the attack flow*

The file ffmpeg.dll contains an embedded URL which is used to retrieve a malicious encoded .ico payload from GitHub file storage at https[:]//raw.githubusercontent.com/IconStorages/images/main/ — though, again, once news of the compromise spread widely, this repository was taken down.

We saw several variations on the ffmpeg.dll file, including one that was signed by 3CX’s own certificate; these appear to be maliciously patched versions of the legitimate ffmpeg.dll. In a statement on Thursday, the team responsible for ffmpeg’s source code took pains to distance their work from the 3CX compromise.

[![A snapshot of the tweet from ffmpeg, which says "There have been several incorrect reports that FFmpeg has been involved in the distribution of malware. FFmpeg only provides source code and the source code has not been compromised. Any "ffmpeg.dll" that has been compromised is the responsibility of the vendor. "](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.png)

*Figure 3: When ffmpeg stepped onto Twitter to defend its code*

In a normal DLL sideloading scenario, the malicious loader (ffmpeg.dll) would replace the clean dependency; its only function would be to queue up the payload. However, in this case, that loader is also entirely functional, as it would normally be in the 3CX product – instead, there’s an additional payload inserted at the DllMain function. Appending malicious code in this fashion adds bulk, but may have lowered suspicions – the abused 3CX application functions as expected, even as the Trojan addresses reached out to the C2 beacon.

As part of our analysis, we also did a comparison of the ffmpeg.dll in 3CX with the same file in other Electron apps. Our analysis has shown only the 3CX ffmpeg.dll contains the malicious code. We conclude from this that this compromise does not affect other Electron apps — only the 3CX ffmpeg.dll.

[![](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Supply-Chain-Diagram.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Supply-Chain-Diagram.png)

*Figure 4: What the affected 3CX developers and customers experienced*

Allowing the abused software to remain functional is not dissimilar to other DLL sideloading cases we’ve seen, but this campaign is slightly different even from the current rash of DLL sideloading cases we’ve seen. In particular, we’ve noted that the PE shellcode loader in use is unique in our experience. Previous to this, we’ve only seen it in incidents attributed to the Lazarus group; the code in this incident is a byte-to-byte match to those previous samples.

We observed that the stealer component also checks for the presence of a specific file, \3CXDesktopApp\config.json. It is not yet clear why it checks for this file.

On the MacOS side, we note three files dropped by the malicious libffmpeg.dylib as notable traces:

* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.session-lock
* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.main\_storage
* ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent

### TimeStamp Check Analysis

As part of our ongoing investigation, we found a timestamp mechanism in the code as shown below.

[![](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-6-Collecting-the-cbData.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-6-Collecting-the-cbData.png)

*Figure 5: A timestamp mechanism in the code*

Looking at this, we can see a while loop that calls the check\_timestamp function and receives a 64-bit integer value from GetSystemTimeAsFileTime Api call. The results of check\_timestamp are evaluated against “v6,” a variable which holds the value coming from cbData.  cbData is collected from the “manifest” file as shown below.

[![](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-5-A-timestamp-mechanism-in-the-code.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Figure-5-A-timestamp-mechanism-in-the-code.png)

*Figure 6: Collecting the cbData*

“manifest” is a file that the malware writes to the system under the “3cxdesktopapp” folder during the initial stage of the infection. When the manifest is created, a dword value is written based on the current timestamp, with additional arithmetic operations performed on it.

The above code checks if manifest exists and is writeable; if so, then it adds 7 days + the current system timestamp + rand() generated number % 21 days. In other words, the value can be up to a total of 28 days ahead. Otherwise, it just reads the existing value from the manifest file.

So long as the results of check\_timestamp are less than v6 (the timestamp value from manifest), the loop continues to sleep. Only once the results of check\_timestamp are greater than the manifest timestamp will the code proceed and generate the HTTP request to connect with GitHub, which initiates the payload download.

```

We also recommend that users of 3CX’s software continue to monitor the company’s communications channels; they have a [blog](https://www.3cx.com/blog/) and also a support-and-information [forum](https://www.3cx.com/community/forums/webrtc-webclient/). As of March 30, the company was recommending that customers uninstall and reinstall the app, and suggested that they might also use the company’s browser-based PWA client while the situation was sorted out.

On March 31, 3CX noted that Google has [invalidated](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/chrome-blocks-latest-msi/) the company’s previous signing certificate, which means both the originally infected MSI files plus files issued by 3CX earlier in the week using that certificate will be blocked, and issued a fresh one. 3CX at this writing is building entirely new MSI installers using the newly issued certificate. This applies to Windows only, as the company states they will not be rebuilding the Mac version of the desktop app yet while they focus on the Windows version (and on the security breach in general).

An updated list of IOCs for this attack is published [on our GitHub](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs).

## **Detection protection**

SophosLabs has blocked the malicious domains and published the following detections:

Static detections:

* Troj/Loader-AF (Trojanized ffmpeg.dll)
* Troj/Mdrop-JTQ (installers)
* Troj/Steal-DLG
* OSX/Mdrop-JTR (installers)
* OSX/Loader-AG (Trojanized libffmpeg.dylib)

Reputation detection:

* Mal/Generic-R / Mal/Generic-S (d3dcompiler with appended shellcode)

Memory detection:

* Mem/Loader-AH

We have also blocked the list of known C2 domains associated with the threat and will continue to add to that list in the IOC file [on our GitHub](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs), as noted above. Finally, the two malicious versions of the ffmpeg.dll bundled in the affected 3CX application are flagged by their hashes as being of low reputation.

SophosLabs is actively investigating additional detection opportunities for activity stemming from this software. In addition, for customers of Sophos MDR, the MDR Detection Engineering team has a variety of behavioral detections in place that will detect follow up activity.

Hello Emanuel – thanks for commenting. We’ve taken a look and here’s what we saw:

Query 2 is a Live Endpoint query that must be run against selected endpoints when they are online. We were able to replicate that error when running the query incorrectly against the data lake. Changing the source to Live Endpoint and then selecting the online endpoints will allow it to run.

Hope that helps.

# 3CX DesktopApp Security Alert

[![Blog Author](https://www.3cx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pierre-jourdan.png)](https://www.3cx.com/blog/author/pjourdan/) Posted on March 30th, 2023 by Pierre Jourdan, Security Pentesting, 3CX

UPDATE: The list of Mac versions has been updated on 01/04 11AM UK time to reflect that one of them was shipped with Update 6.

We regret to inform our partners and customers that our Electron Windows App shipped in Update 7, version numbers **18.12.407 & 18.12.416**, includes a security issue. Anti Virus vendors have flagged the executable 3CXDesktopApp.exe and in many cases uninstalled it. Electron Mac App version numbers **18.11.1213 shipped with Update 6, and 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 in Update 7** are also affected.

The issue appears to be one of the bundled libraries that we compiled into the Windows Electron App via GIT. We’re still researching the matter to be able to provide a more in depth response later today. Here’s some information on what we’ve done so far.

## Domains Have Been Taken Down

The domains contacted by this compromised library have already been reported, with the majority taken down overnight. A github repository which listed them has also been shut down, effectively rendering it harmless.

Worth mentioning - this appears to have been a targeted attack from an Advanced Persistent Threat, perhaps even state sponsored, that ran a complex supply chain attack and picked who would be downloading the next stages of their malware. The vast majority of systems, although they had the files dormant, were in fact never infected.

## New Windows App in Progress

Currently, we’re working on a new Windows App that does not have the issue. We've also decided to issue a new certificate for this app. This will delay things by at least 24 hours so please bear with us.

## Use the PWA App Instead!

We strongly suggest that you use our PWA app instead. The PWA app is completely web based and does 95% of what the electron app does. The advantage is that it does not require any installation or updating and chrome web security is applied automatically.

The reason we have two apps is that when we started the Electron App, the PWA technology was not available yet. Now it's mature and working really well. More information on how to install it [here](https://www.3cx.com/user-manual/web-client/).

## We Are So Sorry

***In the meantime we apologize profusely for what occurred and we will do everything in our power to make up for this error.***
