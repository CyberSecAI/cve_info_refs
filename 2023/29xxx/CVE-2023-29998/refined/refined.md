      "text": "Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.\n\nSuppose a website allows users to submit comments on blog posts, which are displayed to other users. Users submit comments using an HTTP request like the following:\n\n`POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\nContent-Length: 100\npostId=3&comment=This+post+was+extremely+helpful.&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net`\n\nAfter this comment has been submitted, any user who visits the blog post will receive the following within the application's response:\n\n`<p>This post was extremely helpful.</p>`\n\nAssuming the application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, an attacker can submit a malicious comment like this:\n\n`<script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script>`\n\nWithin the attacker's request, this comment would be URL-encoded as:\n\n`comment=%3Cscript%3E%2F*%2BBad%2Bstuff%2Bhere...%2B*%2F%3C%2Fscript%3E`\n\nAny user who visits the blog post will now receive the following within the application's response:\n\n`<p><script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>`\n\nThe script supplied by the attacker will then execute in the victim user's browser, in the context of their session with the application.\n\nIf an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user.",
