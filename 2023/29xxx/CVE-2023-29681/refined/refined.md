- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tenda N301v6 router stores the password used for authentication using weak base64 encoding. Additionally, the router does not implement settings to enable HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Weak Encoding: The password is base64 encoded and transmitted in the "ecos_pw=" cookie, making it easily decodable.
    - Lack of HTTPS: The router does not support HTTPS, so all communication is over HTTP, allowing for easy interception of traffic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intercept the base64 encoded password, decode it, and then log in to the router. Once logged in, the attacker can change the router's password, and interrupt network use.
- **Attack vectors:** ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be on the same LAN or WLAN as the router and must be able to perform ARP spoofing.
