- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A maliciously crafted file, when consumed through the `pskernel.dll` file, can cause memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The memory corruption vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could potentially lead to code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved by using a maliciously crafted file consumed through the `pskernel.dll` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted file that is processed by a vulnerable Autodesk product.
