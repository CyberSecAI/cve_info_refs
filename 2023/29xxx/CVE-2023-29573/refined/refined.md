The provided content relates to CVE-2023-29573.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-memory error within the `mp4info` tool of the Bento4 library, specifically when processing a crafted MP4 file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation: The code attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory (0x800000010 bytes) without proper checks, leading to an out-of-memory condition.
- Insufficient input validation: The program does not properly validate the size of data it's reading from the input MP4 file before using it to allocate memory, resulting in the large allocation request.
- Improper handling of allocation failures: The program crashes with an ASan error message upon failing to allocate the requested amount of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The primary impact of the vulnerability is a denial-of-service. An attacker can provide a crafted MP4 file which causes the tool to crash, making the program unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 file: An attacker could craft a malicious MP4 file that triggers the excessive memory allocation in `mp4info`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application `mp4info`. No special privileges are required.
