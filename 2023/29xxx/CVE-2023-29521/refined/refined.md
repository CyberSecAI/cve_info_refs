Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of the `Macro.VFSTreeMacro` in XWiki. This macro allows XWiki syntax injection through its `root` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation/escaping in the `VFSTreeMacro`.
- Allows injection of XWiki syntax.
- Enables execution of arbitrary code.
- Privilege escalation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python, or Velocity code.
- This can lead to full access to the XWiki installation.
- The attacker can gain programming rights and perform actions they wouldn't normally have permission for.

**Attack vectors:**
- By adding malicious code to the `root` parameter of the `vfsTree` macro.
- The malicious code can be injected in any place where wiki syntax is allowed. For example, a user profile's "about" section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have view rights in XWiki.
- No other specific privileges are required beyond that.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction for the exploit.

**More Details:**
- The `VFSTreeMacro` is not bundled with the default XWiki installation.
- A code injection example is provided in the description:
  `{{vfsTree root="~" /~}~} {{cache id=~"vfs-macro-content~"~}~}{{groovy~}~}println(~"Hello from Groovy!~"){{/groovy~}~}{{/cache~}~}"/}}`
- The vulnerability is tracked under XWIKI-20260 in the XWiki Jira instance.
- The issue is categorized as a "Blocker" priority bug.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.9
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection'))
- The issue has been fixed in XWiki versions 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.2, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11
- A patch is available at  `https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fad02328f5ec7ab7fe5b932ffb5bc5c1ba7a5b12`
