Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29517:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of URLs within the Office document viewer macro in XWiki. Specifically, it allows the macro to fetch and display content from arbitrary URLs, including local files and internal network resources, without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF, where the application can be tricked into making requests to unintended locations.
- **Information Disclosure:** The SSRF vulnerability allows attackers to read local files from the server or make requests to internal services, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the URLs provided to the office viewer macro, allowing it to access internal or file system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive files from the server's file system (e.g., configuration files like `nginx.conf`, `/etc/whois.conf`)
- **Internal Service Exposure:** Attackers can make requests to internal services, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities within the internal network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user, including guests, who has access to create content or comment, demonstrating that no special privileges are needed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Office Document Viewer Macro:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `office` macro, by using a URL with the `url:` scheme in a comment, wiki page, or dashboard gadget.
- **Browser Console Manipulation:** It can be exploited via the browser's console by crafting a specific javascript snippet that manipulates the URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Access:** The attacker needs the ability to add/edit content in XWiki (e.g., by commenting or creating a wiki page), or use the browser console to manipulate the URL.
- **No Authentication (in some cases):** In some instances, the exploit is possible as a guest user, meaning no authentication is required for the basic attack.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the XWiki instance to interact with the macro and potentially access any internal service.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was discovered via a bug bounty program (Intigriti).
- The vulnerability has been addressed in XWiki versions 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.2 and 15.0-rc-1.
- The issue has been assigned a severity of "High" with a CVSS score of 7.5

**CWE:**
- CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
