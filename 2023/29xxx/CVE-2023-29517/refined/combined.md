#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Make sure the office server is running.
2. As guest (or any user with view right) go to the main page of the wiki.
3. Run
   ```

   (function (text) {
     const url = new URL(document.location);
     url.searchParams.append('sheet', 'CKEditor.HTMLConverter');
     url.searchParams.append('formToken', document.documentElement.dataset.xwikiFormToken);
     url.searchParams.append('toHTML', 'true');
     url.searchParams.append('text', text);
    document.location = url;
   })('{{office reference="url:https://example.com/index.html"/}}');

   ```

   in the browsers console.

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed.

**Actual result:**

The content of <https://example.com/index.html> is displayed without styling. This demonstrates server side request forgery that can be used to expose data from internal services that are only accessible from the host. There seem to be limits what contents are displayed, in particular the URL seems to need an ending that resembles a file but apart from that it also seems to display different errors depending on if the URL returns an error or not.

This can be exploited in any wiki page, in comments or also via the HTMLConverter as demonstrated above.

# Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-office-viewer

High

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-m3c3-9qj7-7xmx
Apr 18, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-office-viewer
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 2.5-milestone-2

## Patched versions

15.0-rc-1,14.10.1, 13.10.11, 14.4.8

## Description

### Impact

The office document viewer macro was allowing anyone to see any file content from the hosting server, provided that the office server was connected and depending on the permissions of the user running the servlet engine (e.g. tomcat) running XWiki. The same vulnerability also allowed to perform internal requests to resources from the hosting server.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, 15.0-rc-1.

### Workarounds

It might be possible to workaround this vulnerability by running XWiki in a sandbox with a user with very low privileges on the machine, now to run a servlet engine the user will always need access to some files, so in any case this workaround won't protect all files to be accessed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**SUBMISSION INFORMATION**

* **Submission status**: Archived

**REPORT CONTENT**

* **Severity**: High (8.6)
* **Domain**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/> (Url)
* **Proof of concept**: I found a way to perform a SSRF and retrieve sensitive data from the server.

  As of now I did limited testing but was able to retrieve the `nginx.conf` so for sure more is possible and I will test it out.

\***Steps to reproduce**\*

1. Login with your account on <https://intigriti.xwiki.com>

2. Now go to your porfile (clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner) and then on this page select `My dashboard`

3. Click on `add gadget`

4. Type `document` and select the `Office document viewer`

5. Now as reference enter: `url:<file:///etc/nginx/nginx.conf>`

6. Click `submit` and the contents of the file will be loaded on your dashboard as you can see.

I will test more things to show bigger impact
