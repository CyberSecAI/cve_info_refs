- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device is vulnerable while parsing a random (non-JSON) MQTT payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism (CWE-544)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who can manipulate the communication between the MQTT broker and the affected device can cause a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Manipulating the communication between the MQTT broker and the affected device by sending non-JSON MQTT payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the communication between the MQTT broker and the affected device. No authentication is required, but network access is.
