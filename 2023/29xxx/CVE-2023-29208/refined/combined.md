# Data leak through deleted documents

High

published
GHSA-4f8g-fq6x-jqrr
Apr 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.2-milestone-1

## Patched versions

14.4.7,13.10.11,14.10

## Description

### Impact

Rights added to a document are not taken into account for viewing it once it's deleted. Note that this vulnerability only impact deleted documents that where containing view rights: the view rights provided on a space of a deleted document are properly checked.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10 by checking the rights of current user: only admin and deleter of the document are allowed to view it.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this vulnerability other than upgrading.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
