The provided content describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in Weblab Products version 19.4.03. This aligns with the intention of retrieving CVE details.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `<tem:statement>` parameter of a WSDL file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization in the `<tem:statement>` parameter of a WSDL file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    - Read, update, and delete arbitrary data from the database.
    - Execute commands on the underlying operating system.
    - Cause a denial-of-service to the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious SQL payload within the `<tem:statement>` parameter of a WSDL file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WSDL file, which is publicly accessible, and manipulate the `<tem:statement>` parameter in the request using a tool like Burp Suite. No authentication is required.
