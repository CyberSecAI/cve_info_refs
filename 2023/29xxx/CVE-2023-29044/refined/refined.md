Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-29044:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of "imageData" within document operations, specifically during collaborative editing sessions. This allows for the injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
- Lack of proper escaping of "imageData" content in collaboration mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious script code into document operations.
- This injected script would then be executed for other users actively collaborating on the same document.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions within the application on behalf of the user and potentially other impacts depending on the script's intent.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitation occurs via manipulation of document operations during collaboration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate "imageData" within a document operation.
- Low privileges are required to exploit.
- The attacker must be a participant in a collaborative editing session with another user.
- User interaction is required, the victim needs to be actively collaborating on the same document as the attacker.
