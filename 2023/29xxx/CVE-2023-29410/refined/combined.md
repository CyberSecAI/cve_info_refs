Schneider Electric Security Notification

Conext™ Gateway/ InsightHome and InsightFacility

11 April 2023

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its Conext™ Gateway/ InsightHome and
InsightFacility products.

The InsightHome and InsightFacility products are smart edge devices that connect customers’
Schneider Electric solar and storage systems to the Insight app. InsightHome targets the
residential solar and storage market globally. InsightFacility is for large residential and
commercial solar and storage systems. Conext™ Gateway was discontinued from 2019 and
rebranded as InsightFacility. However, Schneider is still supporting Gateway with firmware fixes.

Failure to apply the remediations provided below may risk remote code execution, which could
result in an authenticated user being able to insert a backdoor into the application or could allow
the extraction of private certificates.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-29410

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.2 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability exists that could allow an authenticated
attacker to gain the same privilege as the application on the server when a malicious payload is
provided over HTTP for the server to execute.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations and follow the general security recommendations to reduce the
risk of exploit:

Ensure admin password is not shared or compromised.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the

most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.
