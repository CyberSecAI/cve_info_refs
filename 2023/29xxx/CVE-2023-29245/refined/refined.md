- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in certain asset fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of the IDS. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the DBMS used by the web application. This could allow the attacker to extract arbitrary information, alter the database structure and data, and/or affect the database's availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted malicious network packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system and have knowledge of the underlying system. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
