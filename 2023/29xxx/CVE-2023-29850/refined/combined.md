### **[rahadchowdhury](/rahadchowdhury)** commented [Apr 3, 2023](#issue-1652878969)

| **Describe the bug** When a user uploads an image in "SLiMS 9 Bulian official source code", the uploaded image’s EXIF Geolocation Data does not gets stripped. As a result, anyone can get sensitive information of "SLiMS 9 Bulian official source code" users like their Geolocation, their Device information like Device Name, Version, Software & Software version used etc.  **CMS Version:** v9.5.2  **Affected URL:** <http://127.0.0.1/bulian/admin/index.php?mod=membership>  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Got to Github ( <https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/tree/master/jpg>) 2. There are lot of images having resolutions (i.e 1280 \* 720 ) , and also whith different MB’s .    login your admin panel and membership menu and upload photo in any member profile. 3. see the path of uploaded image ( Either by right click on image then copy image address OR right click, inspect the image, the URL will come in the inspect , edit it as html ) 4. open it (<https://www.verexif.com/en/index.php>) 5. See whether is that still showing exif data , if it is then Report it.   **Proof Of Concept:** You can see the Proof of Concept. which I've attached screenshots and video to confirm the vulnerability.  **Screenshots** [screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/229643111-faa0574b-9aa0-4b03-a0d0-da0f7f18e3a1.png) [screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/229643122-6698a566-4d72-4b66-b5c5-ede2aedf76d4.png) [screenshot_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/229643136-7eefeefc-0bb8-4797-9a2a-5a707157152b.png) [screenshot3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/229643152-df7cbe53-8070-4735-ba9e-3707f6b3f5a2.png)  **Video**    video.mp4     **Desktop (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Windows 10 * Browser: Google Chrome   **Impact** This vulnerability is CRITICAL and impacts all the "SLiMS 9 Bulian official source code" customer base. This vulnerability violates the privacy of a User and shares sensitive information of the user who uploads an image on SLiMS 9 Bulian official.  Let me know if any further info is required.
