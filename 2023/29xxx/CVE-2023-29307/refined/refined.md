- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an 'Open Redirect', which occurs when a web application redirects users to an untrusted external site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect users to a malicious site.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in a security feature bypass. An attacker could trick users into visiting a malicious site disguised as a legitimate one.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack requires low complexity (AC:L) and low privileges (PR:L). It also requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect parameter and lure a user into clicking it.
