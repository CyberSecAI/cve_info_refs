Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-29052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-defined disclaimer texts within an upsell shop dialog. This allows users to inject script code into the disclaimer text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input (the disclaimer text) is not properly neutralized before being included in the web page's HTML, leading to the execution of malicious script code when a user views the dialog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a trusted domain.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** By luring victims to user accounts with malicious code, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information, modify settings or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely via a network connection.
- **User-supplied input:** The attack requires an attacker to be able to define the disclaimer text for the upsell shop dialog.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** Attackers need only low level privileges to define the vulnerable text field.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker must lure a user to interact with the crafted shop dialog in order to execute the malicious javascript.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the OX App Suite frontend, specifically versions 7.10.6-rev34 and is fixed in 7.10.6-rev35.
- The CVSS score is 5.4, with a medium severity.
