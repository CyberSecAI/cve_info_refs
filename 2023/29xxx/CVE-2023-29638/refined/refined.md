Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present on the article page of the web application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The application allows an attacker to inject malicious script into an article, and that script is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected article.
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-provided input when publishing articles, which allows injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When the malicious script is executed in a user's browser, an attacker could potentially perform various actions, such as:
  - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user (if the user is logged in)
  - Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts an article containing malicious script using the article publishing page.
- The attacker uses the article publishing endpoint `/admin/article/publish` to inject the malicious script in a blog article.
- This malicious script is stored and later executed when a user views the article on the blog article interface (`/blog/article/{id}`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to publish articles on the web application.
- The attacker has to access the `/admin/article/publish` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities and JavaScript.
