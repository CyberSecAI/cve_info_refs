| There is a stored XSS on the article page.   1. On the "article publish" page，attackers can post an article containing a malicious script.    path: <http://localhost:8089/admin/article/publish>    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48405266/225189015-dc683e90-fab9-4fc5-a983-a74cb07f4106.png) 2. This XSS vulnerability can be triggered by attackers reading articles in the blog article interface.    path: <http://localhost:8089/blog/article/29>    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48405266/225190003-8cc236f7-5895-48fa-b065-88e389425a2f.png) |
