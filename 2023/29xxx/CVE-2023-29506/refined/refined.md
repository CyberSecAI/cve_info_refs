Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29506:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the URL in the authentication endpoints. Specifically, parts of the URI are reflected in the body tag without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to:
*   Performing actions within the application that the user can perform.
*   Modifying the DOM environment and retrieving/modifying values.
*   Viewing information that the user is able to view.
*   Initiating interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks that appear to originate from the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication endpoints. Specifically, crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads injected into the `wiki` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it. No special privileges or prior authentication is required. The attacker can be remote (network-based attack vector). User interaction is required as the victim needs to click on the malicious link.

* The vulnerable endpoints are related to authentication actions such as reset password and retrieve username.
* The vulnerability affects XWiki versions 13.10.8 and later, 14.4.3 and later, and 14.6 and later, but has been patched in versions 13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10.
