- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A maliciously crafted DLL file can be forced to install onto a non-default location. An attacker can overwrite parts of the product with malicious DLLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to the ability to install and execute malicious DLLs in the context of the affected application, which has elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves installing a malicious DLL file in a non-default location, overwriting legitimate files which may lead to privilege escalation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to introduce a malicious DLL file to the system and force it to be loaded/executed by the affected application.
