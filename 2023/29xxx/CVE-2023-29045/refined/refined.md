Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-29045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the manipulation of document operations, specifically "drawing" operations, allowing for the inclusion of invalid data types, potentially containing script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS, arising from insufficient sanitization of input data during document operations, specifically related to the "drawing" operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** Malicious script code can be injected into document operations.
- **Compromised Collaboration:** The injected script code could be executed on other users' browsers who are actively collaborating on the same document, leading to potential session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Manipulation of Document Operations:** Attackers manipulate document "drawing" operations to insert malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the malicious script is executed when another user interacts with the manipulated document in collaboration mode.
- **Collaboration Scenario:** Exploitation requires an attacker to participate in a collaborative document editing session with the target user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves checking the validity of operation data exchanged between collaborating parties to avoid code execution.
- This vulnerability is specific to Open-Xchange App Suite office 7.10.6-rev7 and is fixed in version 7.10.6-rev8.
- There are no publicly available exploits known for this vulnerability.
