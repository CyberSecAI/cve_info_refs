- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A classic buffer overflow (CWE-120) vulnerability exists due to a lack of input size validation when processing specific string input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to access system-level functions, potentially including the command shell.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending crafted string input to a local function call within the Accutech Manager application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to interact with the vulnerable application.
