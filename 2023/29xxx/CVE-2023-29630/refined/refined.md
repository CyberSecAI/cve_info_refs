Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajax_jmsvermegamenu.php` file of the Jms Vertical MegaMenu module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `params` parameter from user input is directly used in an SQL query without prior sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the vulnerable `params` parameter, potentially manipulating data or extracting sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Technical and personal data leaks:** Attackers could extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Obtaining admin access:** By manipulating queries, attackers may gain administrative privileges.
- **Removal of data:** The attacker could delete or modify database records.
- **Displaying sensitive tables:** Attackers could expose sensitive data through the front-office.
- **Unlocking admin's ajax scripts:** Attackers might bypass token protections of modules.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any interaction from the shop administrator.
- **Low attack complexity:** The attack is of low complexity making it easy to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions (at least 1.1.x and 2.0.x) of the Jms Vertical MegaMenu module from Joommasters.
- The provided patch shows that the fix involves using `pSQL()` to sanitize the `params` parameter before incorporating it into the SQL query.
- The provided advisory also recommends upgrading PrestaShop to disable multiquery executions and using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
