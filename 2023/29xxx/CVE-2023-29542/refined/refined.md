  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "A newline character in a filename bypasses the file extension security mechanisms.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Bypass of filename extension restrictions"
      ],
      "impact": "Accidental execution of malicious code due to the ability to bypass the file extension security mechanisms, potentially allowing a user to download and execute files with dangerous extensions, such as .lnk, .url, or .scf, without the intended .download suffix.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious website or extension can initiate a file download with a crafted filename containing a newline character.",
         "When a user tries to save a malicious file using Save As, they can modify the file name such as adding a newline character, which allows the download to bypass extension restrictions and directly downloads the file with the intended dangerous extension without having the .download suffix added to it."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a filename with a newline character and either host the file on a malicious website, inject it into a compromised website, or use a malicious browser extension. No additional user interaction is required beyond initiating the download and opening the downloaded file by the user.  However, the user can also trigger this vulnerability with the Save As dialog.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because Firefox sanitizes filenames before checking for dangerous extensions, but the sanitization does not remove or neutralize the newline character, allowing it to bypass the protection mechanisms. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows."
