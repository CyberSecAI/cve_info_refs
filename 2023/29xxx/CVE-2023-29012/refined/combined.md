# The config file of `connect.exe` is susceptible to malicious placing

High

[vdye](/vdye)
published
GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm
Apr 25, 2023

## Package

git-for-windows
(-)

## Affected versions

<2.40.1

## Patched versions

2.40.1

## Description

### Impact

Git for Windows ships with an executable called `connect.exe`, which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections.

The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\etc\connectrc`. Since `C:\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1.

### Workarounds

Create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders:

```
mkdir \etc
icacls \etc /inheritance:r

```

Alternatively, be very careful to watch out for malicious `<drive>:\etc\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.

### References

Source code repository of the `connect` proxy: <https://github.com/gotoh/ssh-connect>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[`ceee26d`](/git-for-windows/git/commit/ceee26d5cac05a3437097b43d034c4ad2e99d571)

Changes since Git for Windows v2.40.0 (March 14th 2023)

This is a security release, addressing [CVE-2023-29012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5x-v87v-8f7g), [CVE-2023-29011](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm), [CVE-2023-29007](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v48j-4xgg-4844), [CVE-2023-25815](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8) and [CVE-2023-25652](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-2hvf-7c8p-28fx).

As announced previously, Git for Windows will drop support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8 in one of the next versions, following [Cygwin's and MSYS2's lead](https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/) (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).

Also following the footsteps of the MSYS2 and Cygwin projects on which Git for Windows depends, the 32-bit variant of Git for Windows [is nearing its end of support](https://gitforwindows.org/32-bit.html).

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.40.1](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.40.1/Documentation/RelNotes/2.40.1.txt).

### Bug Fixes

* Addresses [CVE-2023-29012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5x-v87v-8f7g), a vulnerability where starting Git CMD would execute `doskey.exe` in the current directory, if it exists.
* Addresses [CVE-2023-29011](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm), a vulnerability where the SOCKS5 proxy called `connect.exe` is susceptible to picking up an untrusted configuration on multi-user machines.
* Addresses [CVE-2023-29007](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v48j-4xgg-4844), a vulnerability where `git submodule deinit` can inadvertently introduce malicious changes into the Git config file.
* Addresses [CVE-2023-25815](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8), a vulnerability where Git can unexpectedly show crafted "localized" messages written by another user on a multi-user machine.
* Addresses [CVE-2023-25652](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-2hvf-7c8p-28fx), a vulnerability where `git apply --reject` could follow symbolic links to write files outside the worktree.

# Arbitrary configuration injection via `git submodule deinit`

High

[ttaylorr](/ttaylorr)
published
GHSA-v48j-4xgg-4844
Apr 25, 2023

## Package

git
(-)

## Affected versions

<= v2.30.8, v2.31.7, v2.32.6, v2.33.7, v2.34.7, v2.35.7, v2.36.5, v2.37.6, v2.38.4, v2.39.2 and v2.40.0

## Patched versions

>= v2.30.9, v2.31.8, v2.32.7, v2.33.8, v2.34.8, v2.35.8, v2.36.6, v2.37.7, v2.38.5, v2.39.3 and v2.40.1

## Description

### Impact

A bug in the function responsible for renaming or deleting existing configuration sections in-place, `git_config_copy_or_rename_section_in_file()`, can result in improperly treating configuration values as the beginning of new sections when they are over 1,024 characters long.

This bug can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` when attempting to rename or remove a malicious configuration section. This can result in arbitrary execution of code, by inserting values for `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand` and so on.

This may be exploited with overly-long submodule URLs, which are stored in a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` upon initialization. Those URLs may be misinterpreted as containing new configuration material when removing those sections, e.g., with `git submodule deinit`.

## Patches

A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.30.9, v2.31.8, v2.32.7, v2.33.8, v2.34.8, v2.35.8, v2.36.6, v2.37.7, v2.38.5, v2.39.3 and v2.40.1.

### Workarounds

Avoid running `git submodule deinit`, or `git config --rename-section` or `git config --remove-section` on untrusted repositories or without prior inspection of your `$GIT_DIR/config`.

## Acknowledgements

Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to André Baptista and Vítor Pinho of Ethiack. The fix was developed by Taylor Blau, Jeff King, Patrick Steinhardt, and Johannes Schindelin.

# "git apply --reject" partially-controlled arbitrary file write

Moderate

[ttaylorr](/ttaylorr)
published
GHSA-2hvf-7c8p-28fx
Apr 25, 2023

## Package

git
(-)

## Affected versions

<=2.30.8, .., v2.40.0

## Patched versions

v2.30.9, v2.31.8, v2.32.7, v2.33.8, v2.34.8, v2.35.8, v2.36.6, v2.37.7, v2.38.5, v2.39.3 and v2.40.1

## Description

### Impact

By feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from the given patch).

### Patches

A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.30.9, v2.31.8, v2.32.7, v2.33.8, v2.34.8, v2.35.8, v2.36.6, v2.37.7, v2.38.5, v2.39.3 and v2.40.1.

### Workarounds

Avoid using `git apply` with `--reject` when applying patches from an untrusted source. Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying; avoid applying one that create a conflict where a link corresponding to the `*.rej` file exists.

### Severity

Moderate

# Git looks for localized messages in an unprivileged place

Low

[vdye](/vdye)
published
GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8
Apr 25, 2023

## Package

git-for-windows
(-)

## Affected versions

<=2.40.0

## Patched versions

v2.40.1

## Description

### Impact

In Git for Windows, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization.

However, due to the change in [msys2/MINGW-packages#10461](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461), the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\mingw64\share\locale` to look for localized messages.

And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\` (and since `C:\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up.

This vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires a lot of social engineering. For example, a

legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1.

### Workarounds

Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. If you have administrative rights, remove the permission to create folders in `C:\`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# 32-bit support of Git for Windows

While Git for Windows v1.x was only ever offered as 32-bit installer (i.e. targeting the i686 CPU architecture), with the switch of Git for Windows v2.x in August 2015 to depend on [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), there have been two variants: the 32-bit and the 64-bit (x86\_64) one.

However, due to Git for Windows' reliance on the MSYS2, which [dropped 32-bit support](https://www.msys2.org/news/#2020-05-17-32-bit-msys2-no-longer-actively-supported) (the 32-bit version of the MSYS2 runtime [cannot even be built](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-runtime/commit/762dcfc658c85de8d418c6ba4e0e40024bee118a) as of version 3.4.0), Git for Windows will start to phase out 32-bit support after Git for Windows v2.40.x.

## Timeline

### March 2023: End of full 32-bit support

The last major Git for Windows version with full 32-bit support will be v2.40.x.

### Until 2025: Limited 32-bit support

The 32-bit variant of Git for Windows will still be offered, but not all of the components distributed with Git for Windows will necessarily be updated as for the 64-bit variant.

For example, 64-bit Git for Windows v2.41.x will ship with the MSYS2 runtime v3.4.x, while 32-bit Git for Windows will remain with v3.3.6 forever.

### Until 2029: MinGit-only 32-bit support

The only official 32-bit artifacts built by the Git for Windows project will be MinGit, the minimal subset of Git for Windows intended for third-party applications (i.e. providing all Git functionality needed by applications, but not functionality needed for interactive usage by a human user).

### After April 2029: End of 32-bit support

Git for Windows will no longer provide any official 32-bit artifacts.
