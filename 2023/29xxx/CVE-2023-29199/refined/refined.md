Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the source code transformer of vm2, specifically in the exception sanitization logic. The code transformer instruments code with sanitizer function calls to prevent host exceptions from leaking host objects into the sandbox. However, the implementation of the transformer allows for bypassing the `handleException()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Sanitization:** The code transformer uses string interpolation to insert the catch clause identifier into the code to be sanitized. The sanitization process replaces `$tmpname` with a pre-defined string. However, it does not account for cases where the attacker can define their own identifier names that include `$tmpname`, thus bypassing sanitization.
- **Bypass of `handleException()`:** By creating an exception handler that includes the string `$tmpname` in the identifier (e.g., `a$tmpname`), the attacker can bypass the intended sanitization via the `handleException()` function. This allows host exceptions with host objects to be leaked into the sandbox.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sandbox Escape:** By leaking unsanitized host exceptions, an attacker can gain access to the host's `Function` constructor.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Using the host's `Function` constructor, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host system running the sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code within the `vm2` sandbox.
- The attacker then crafts code that defines a catch block with an identifier containing the string `$tmpname`, to bypass the exception sanitization, and then trigger a host exception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code within the `vm2` sandbox environment.
- No user interaction is required for the exploit.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.9.16 of vm2.
- The issue was reported by Xion (SeungHyun Lee) of KAIST Hacking Lab.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
- The patch involves reworking the replacement logic in the transformer.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by creating an exception and then using the leaked host exception to access the host's `child_process` module.
