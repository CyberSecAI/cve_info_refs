# Sandbox Escape

Critical

[patriksimek](/patriksimek)
published
GHSA-xj72-wvfv-8985
Apr 11, 2023

## Package

npm

vm2
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 3.9.15

## Patched versions

3.9.16

## Description

There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception sanitization logic) of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.15, allowing attackers to bypass `handleException()` and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context.

### Impact

A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox.

### Patches

This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.16` of `vm2`.

### Workarounds

None.

### References

Github Issue - [#516](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/516)

PoC - <https://gist.github.com/leesh3288/f05730165799bf56d70391f3d9ea187c>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Sandbox Escape in vm2@3.9.15

 [Raw](/leesh3288/f05730165799bf56d70391f3d9ea187c/raw/b2e0eaebf69f5f7769f620bb7c44418a1704520a/vm2_3.9.15_sandbox_escape.md)

[**vm2\_3.9.15\_sandbox\_escape.md**](#file-vm2_3-9-15_sandbox_escape-md)

# Sandbox Escape in vm2@3.9.15

## Summary

There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception sanitization logic) of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.15, allowing attackers to bypass `handleException()` and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context.

## Proof of Concept

```
const {VM} = require("vm2");
const vm = new VM();

const code = `
aVM2_INTERNAL_TMPNAME = {};
function stack() {
    new Error().stack;
    stack();
}
try {
    stack();
} catch (a$tmpname) {
    a$tmpname.constructor.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('touch pwned');
}
`

console.log(vm.run(code));
```

## Analysis

As host exceptions may leak host objects into the sandbox, code is preprocessed with `transformer()` ([lib/transformer.js:49](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/blob/3.9.15/lib/transformer.js#L49)) in order to instrument the code with sanitizer function calls ([lib/transformer.js:108](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/blob/3.9.15/lib/transformer.js#L108)).

Identifier name of catch clause is interpolated into `insertions` as `code` ([lib/transformer.js:137](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/blob/3.9.15/lib/transformer.js#L137)) to sanitize caught exception, possibly a host exception.

This is subsequently post-processed to replace `$tmpname` with the string value in `tmpname` (originally `VM2_INTERNAL_TMPNAME`) for `ObjectPattern` case sanitization code ([lib/transformer.js:189](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/blob/3.9.15/lib/transformer.js#L189)), which in turn allows an attacker to bypass `handleException()` with identifiers containing the string `$tmpname`.

An attacker may then use any method to raise a host exception ([test/vm.js:1082](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/blob/3.9.15/test/vm.js#L1082) for example, via internal `prepareStackTrace`) and use it to access host `Function` constructor, escaping the sandbox and gaining arbitrary code execution in host context.

## Impact

Remote Code Execution, assuming the attacker has arbitrary code execution primitive inside the context of vm2 sandbox.

| Hello, this is Xion (SeungHyun Lee) from [KAIST Hacking Lab](https://kaist-hacking.github.io/).  We have found a sandbox escape vulnerability in the vm2@3.9.15 (latest). As this is a security issue we would like to contact the administrators via email, but could not find any point of contact.  Could the administrators share an email address to send the vulnerability report? [@XmiliaH](https://github.com/XmiliaH) [@patriksimek](https://github.com/patriksimek)  Regards, Xion. |
