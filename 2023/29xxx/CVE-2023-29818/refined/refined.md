The provided content relates to CVE-2023-29818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default allowlist feature in Webroot SecureAnywhere Endpoint Protection is stored in a way that allows non-administrative users to access it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Permissive List of Allowed Inputs (CWE-183): The software allows an attacker to bypass protections by matching their malicious payload to the file name, path, and size of a file in the default allowlist.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can bypass security protections. This could lead to execution of arbitrary code, malware infection, or other malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the machine is required.
- The attacker needs to create a payload that matches the file name, file path, and file size of a file present in the default allowlist.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker does not need administrative privileges to carry out the attack.
