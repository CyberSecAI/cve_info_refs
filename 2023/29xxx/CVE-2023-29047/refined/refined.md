Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-29047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Imageconverter API endpoints had methods that did not sufficiently validate and sanitize client input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of proper input validation and sanitization allowed for the injection of arbitrary SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the adjacent network and potentially API credentials could read and modify database content accessible to the imageconverter SQL user account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires access to the adjacent network where the imageconverter service is located. This service is not exposed to public networks by default.
- An attacker would need to send malicious requests to the vulnerable Imageconverter API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to the imageconverter service.
- Potentially, the attacker needs API credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the "getMetadata" function of the Imageconverter API.
- The issue was addressed by implementing validation of API request parameters. Invalid parameters are logged and a `BAD_REQUEST` (HTTP 400) response is returned.
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2023-03-14.
- The affected versions are OXAS-OFFICE 7.10.6-rev5 and 8.12, and the fix is included in OXAS-OFFICE 7.10.6-rev6 and 8.13.
