Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29514:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code, specifically within the template provider administration in XWiki. The `AdminTemplatesSheet` was not properly escaping the title of the template provider, allowing the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the title.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Eval Injection (CWE-95):** The core vulnerability is the injection of code through the title of a template provider. The system dynamically evaluates this title without proper sanitization, leading to code execution.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize the template provider title before displaying it in the `AdminTemplatesSheet`, allowing the embedded code to be interpreted and executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker with edit rights on any document can inject code that will be executed with programming rights when the `AdminTemplatesSheet` is accessed. This allows a low-privileged user to escalate their privileges and perform arbitrary actions on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a regular user can escalate to programming rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through the XWiki web interface.
- **User Interaction:** No direct user interaction is required beyond an administrator accessing the crafted `AdminTemplatesSheet`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only edit rights on any document, such as their own user profile.
- **Knowledge of XWiki:** The attacker must understand how to create a `TemplateProviderClass` object and craft the malicious title with embedded code.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a document title is set to include executable code within the `{{async}}` and `{{groovy}}` directives, then a `XWiki.TemplateProviderClass` object is added to that document.
- When the `AdminTemplatesSheet` is accessed, the title is not properly escaped, and the Groovy code is executed, leading to a privilege escalation.
- The patch involves double escaping the template provider title when rendered in the `AdminTemplatesSheet` to prevent code injection.
- The provided commit diff shows changes in `PageTemplatesIT.java` to include a test case for the vulnerability and `AdminTemplatesSheet.xml` to implement the fix.
