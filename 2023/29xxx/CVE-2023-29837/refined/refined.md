**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web application fails to adequately sanitize request strings of malicious JavaScript, specifically in the URL path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in a user's browser within the security context of the affected site. This can lead to various malicious activities, potentially including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
