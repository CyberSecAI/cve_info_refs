Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of HTML comments within the "restricted" mode of the XWiki HTML cleaner. Specifically, the HTML cleaner incorrectly parses HTML comments that start with `>` or `->`, leading to a bypass of the intended sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect HTML Comment Parsing:** The core issue is the discrepancy between how the HTML cleaner and web browsers interpret HTML comments starting with `>` or `->`. The HTML cleaner incorrectly treats `<!-->` as the beginning of an HTML comment, while browsers treat it as an empty comment, thus leading to unexpected results when parsing the HTML.
*   **Bypass of Restricted Mode:**  The vulnerability lies in the `restricted` mode of the HTML cleaner failing to sanitize comments. This mode is intended to filter out potentially dangerous HTML but is bypassed using a crafted comment.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting a specially crafted comment (e.g. `<!--> <Details Open OnToggle=confirm("XSS")>`), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that gets executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
*   **Server-Side Code Execution:** If a privileged user visits a page containing the malicious code, the attacker can potentially achieve server-side code execution with the privileges of the user.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is exploited via stored XSS, where the malicious code is stored within the XWiki application (e.g. in a user profile's "about" text area or in a comment) and then executed when a victim views the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject content:** The attacker needs the ability to inject content that can be processed through the vulnerable HTML cleaner, such as in user profiles, comments, or other text areas.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to inject the malicious content.
*   **User interaction:** The attack requires a victim to view a page where the malicious code is stored.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in XWiki versions from 4.2-milestone-1 up to (but not including) 14.10. The issue was introduced in 4.2-milestone-1. The need for the specific comment structure was introduced in version 14.6-rc-1.
*   The fix involves removing HTML comments in restricted mode and introducing a check to ensure comments don't start with `>`.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-x37v-36wv-6v6h.
*   The vulnerability was reported by "ynoof" via Intigriti.
