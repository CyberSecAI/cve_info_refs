- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web management application of the Enel X Waybox Pro and Plus charger allows execution of arbitrary OS commands due to insufficient security measures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation grants an attacker administrator privileges over the Waybox system.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending requests to the Waybox web management application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web management application.
