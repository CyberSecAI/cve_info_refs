Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper escaping of section IDs within the `XWiki.AdminFieldsDisplaySheet` page. This page, which is installed by default, renders user-supplied section IDs without sufficient sanitization.
- The `admin.vm` template is used to set the `$section` variable from the request parameter, which can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`section` parameter) before rendering it within the `AdminFieldsDisplaySheet`, leading to injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the section ID is included in form IDs, fieldset classes, and URLs.
- **Code Injection:**  Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary XWiki syntax, including Groovy, Python, or Velocity macros. This is possible because the section parameter is included in a velocity template without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with edit rights on a page (including their own user page) can inject and execute arbitrary code, gaining full control over the XWiki installation.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute Groovy, Python, or Velocity code allows attackers to perform a wide range of actions, including accessing sensitive data, modifying system configurations, and potentially taking over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Web Request Parameter:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request including the 'section' parameter containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs edit rights on any page (e.g. their user page). This is a low privilege requirement.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in XWiki versions 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11.
- The `section` parameter in the URL is used to inject malicious code.
- The injected code is first converted to lowercase, which may limit the APIs available but can be bypassed.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Generated Code).
- The fix involved escaping special characters in the form ids and other places where the section parameter was used within `AdminFieldsDisplaySheet.xml`.
