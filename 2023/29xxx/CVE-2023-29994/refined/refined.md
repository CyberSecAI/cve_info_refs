The provided content is related to CVE-2023-29994.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_byte` function within `mqtt_codec.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) in the `read_byte` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited successfully. The provided ASAN output indicates a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted MQTT packet to the broker.
- The provided python script `check_crash_log()` sends crafted byte sequences to the broker in order to trigger the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send MQTT packets to the vulnerable broker.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific crafted byte sequences to trigger the overflow.
