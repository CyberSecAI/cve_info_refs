GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 is an IoT Gateway to connect programmable logic controllers to cloud services
and enables the connection of ﬁeld devices with OPC UA server Interface as OPC UA clients.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28832

The web based management of affected devices does not properly validate user input, making it
susceptible to command injection. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-29104

The ﬁlename in the upload feature of the web based management of the affected device is susceptible
to a path traversal vulnerability. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to
overwrite any ﬁle the Linux user ccuser has write access to, or to download any ﬁle the Linux user
ccuser has read-only access to.
