- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The export endpoint is accessible via REST API without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication on the export endpoint, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can download files available through the endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device via the REST API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device. No authentication is required.
