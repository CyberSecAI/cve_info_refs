Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2023-29010.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability present in the Budibase REST connector. This vulnerability arises from the network infrastructure rules that permitted connections from the Budibase REST connector to the internal AWS metadata IP address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SSRF:** The primary weakness is the SSRF vulnerability, which allowed an attacker to make requests to internal resources, specifically the AWS metadata service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to AWS metadata:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access the internal AWS metadata IP address.
- **Retrieval of AWS Secret Key:** By accessing the metadata service, the attacker could retrieve a temporary AWS secret key. This key could potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to other AWS resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using the Budibase REST API request functionality, specifically the "import raw text" feature, to craft a request to the internal AWS metadata endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Budibase Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid Budibase account to access the REST connector functionality.
- **Knowledge of AWS Metadata Endpoint:** The attacker must know the internal AWS metadata IP address (169.254.169.254) and the path to retrieve the credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by an external security researcher and was not exploited before the patch.
*   Budibase patched the vulnerability quickly and has taken measures to prevent similar issues in the future.
*   The AWS role that would have been exploited did not have access to the production database, minimizing potential damage.
*   Budibase has cycled all AWS keys and production database credentials as a precautionary measure.
*   Self-hosted Budibase users are advised to ensure their internal metadata endpoint is not exposed when running Budibase on the public internet.
