- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, missing authorization, authentication, or nonce checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (subscriber role) can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact is not detailed and can vary.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly mentioned, but would likely be through the WordPress plugin's functionality or an API endpoint that is not correctly protected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a subscriber-level account on the affected WordPress site.
