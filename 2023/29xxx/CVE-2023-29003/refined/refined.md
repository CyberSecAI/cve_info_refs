{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SvelteKit framework's CSRF protection mechanism was insufficient because it only checked for 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and 'multipart/form-data' Content-Types in POST requests, allowing bypass with 'text/plain'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient CSRF protection due to incomplete Content-Type validation.",
      "Potential for method override bypass."
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious requests could be submitted from third-party domains, enabling actions within a victim's session and potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks initiated from a malicious third-party website.",
         "Bypassing CSRF protection by sending requests with Content-Type 'text/plain'."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a victim to a malicious webpage to initiate the forged request. The attacker also needs knowledge about the application's API endpoints and parameters and how to make the victim's browser send the requests."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "SvelteKit 1.15.1 updated the CSRF protection logic to include `text/plain` in the list of blocked content types, and also added checks for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods to prevent method override.",
    "changes": [
      "The `is_form_content_type` function was updated to include 'text/plain'.",
      "CSRF checks were extended to include PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.",
       "Updated documentation and added changeset."
    ]
