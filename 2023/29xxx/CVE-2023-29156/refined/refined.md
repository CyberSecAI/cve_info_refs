Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-29156

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver's susceptibility to traffic injection. By injecting spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages at specific times, an attacker can cause the receiver to drop legitimate Remote ID (RID) information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the receiver's failure to properly validate the source and authenticity of ODID messages. This allows the injection of spoofed messages that the receiver processes as valid.
- The device does not differentiate between legitimate and malicious data, enabling the attacker to overwrite the correct data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Loss:** The receiver drops real RID information.
- **Data Manipulation:** The receiver generates and transmits JSON encoded MQTT messages containing crafted (attacker-controlled) RID information. This leads to the distribution of false data to consumers of the MQTT feed, affecting any dependent systems relying on this data.
- The CVSS score indicates a low impact on Confidentiality and Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Traffic Injection:** The attacker injects spoofed ODID messages into the network that the DroneScout ds230 receiver is monitoring.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to inject these messages at specific times to cause the receiver to drop valid data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be within the network or have the ability to inject packets into the network that the DroneScout is monitoring, implying a need for close proximity or network access.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be capable of crafting and injecting Open Drone ID messages.
- **Timing Control:** The attacker needs a method to inject spoofed messages at the appropriate time to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects DroneScout ds230 receivers with firmware versions from 20211210-1627 up to 20230329-1042.
- The provided mitigation involves updating to a firmware version newer than 20230329-1042 and setting "transmit_mode=2" in the configuration file.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nicol√≤ Facchi of Nozomi Networks.
