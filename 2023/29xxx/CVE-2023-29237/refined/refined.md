- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized modification or deletion of posts.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can exploit a function lacking proper access control to perform actions they should not have permission to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least subscriber level access to the WordPress site.
