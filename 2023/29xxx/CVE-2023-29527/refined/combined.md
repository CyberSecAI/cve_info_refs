#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or programming right, edit your user profile (or any other document) with the wiki editor and add the content
   ```
   {{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from Groovy!"){{/groovy}}

   ```
2. Edit the document with the object editor and add an object of type AppWithinMinutes.LiveTableClass (no values need to be set, just save)
3. View the document

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed that the user cannot execute the Groovy macro.

**Actual result:**

Below "Entries", the text "Hello from Groovy!" is displayed, showing that the Groovy macro has been executed.

This demonstrates remote code execution and privilege escalation from a simple user account with only edit rights on the own profile.

The reason for this is that AppWithinMinutes.LiveTableViewSheet uses a [hack](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/489c90c3722b16d45685a9864b0ac91e10f28fd2/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes/xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes-ui/src/main/resources/AppWithinMinutes/LiveTableViewSheet.xml#L52) for including the document's content that aims to securely include the document's content to work around [~~XWIKI-5027~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5027 "In Syntax xwiki/2.x, programming rights may be inherited by inclusion which may leads to security issues") but after fixing [~~XWIKI-5477~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5477 "It's possible to easily execute anything in the context of any document from public API"), this hack is no longer secure but executes the document's content with the sheet's rights. This is also where the affects version comes from.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
