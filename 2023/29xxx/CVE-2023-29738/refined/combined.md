September 12, 2019Alarms are loud but not loud enough to wake up my parents in the next room. 👍 They go off at the exact time I want them too.👍 The snooze and turn off alarm buttons are coloured big and clear.👍 The sleep schedule notifications are very useful. 👍 The options for what you can do in the app are easy to understand. 👍 The settings are easy to change.👍 I am new to this app and I recently found out that there is more to do on it. After I check that out I might edit this. If I can.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamSeptember 13, 2019Thank you so much!

February 15, 2021Deleting it because it constantly just decides to never go off despite having 3 alarms set. Have been late constantly over a few years just because this alarm randomly doesn't go off. Even when you go In to history it says last alarm 3 days ago and no explication why it didn't go off that day. Absolute shite. If this didn't happen it would be a great app.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamMarch 5, 2021Really sorry to hear that.

September 28, 2018Worked without fail in the two weeks I've been using it. The need to scam a bar code actually has me get you in the morning to open the light at the other side of my bedroom to stop the alarm from not shutting up, which is the first time am alarm makes me do that, so it's great. I would love to see a stopwatch or a timer added to the app, which would make it even more perfect, but as an alarm in and of itself it is great.Did you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamSeptember 29, 2018Thank you so much for your great feedback! (you can add timer alarms if you select the Countdown Timer recurrence type - just send a message with the Help and feedback menu of the app please so we could help you)See all reviews

October 30, 2024I love your keyboard themes they're amazing. I don't like the fact that you don't have slide to text that lets you slide from 1 letter to the next & it types your word I currently use Gboard which allows side typing & it has emojis suggestions at the top everything I need is right at the top of the keyboard in a row If you can input those two things I'll reinstall. Hope you fix those 2 things ASAP as I'd love to reinstall your keyboard right away & use it NOW!!7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBR-JbgcmpObc4RdgMrsqyRIngsktR_S18VkYx9WJE_iRYo83z=s32-rw)Sanjiv Joshi*more\_vert*
