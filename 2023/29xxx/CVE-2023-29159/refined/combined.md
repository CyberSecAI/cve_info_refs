# Path traversal vulnerability in StaticFiles

Low

[Kludex](/Kludex)
published
GHSA-v5gw-mw7f-84px
May 16, 2023

## Package

pip

starlette
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=0.13.5

## Patched versions

0.27.0

## Description

### Summary

When using `StaticFiles`, if there's a file or directory that starts with the same name as the `StaticFiles` directory, that file or directory is also exposed via `StaticFiles` which is a path traversal vulnerability.

### Details

The root cause of this issue is the usage of `os.path.commonprefix()`:

[starlette/starlette/staticfiles.py](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/4bab981d9e870f6cee1bd4cd59b87ddaf355b2dc/starlette/staticfiles.py#L172-L174)

Lines 172 to 174
in
[4bab981](/encode/starlette/commit/4bab981d9e870f6cee1bd4cd59b87ddaf355b2dc)

|  | if os.path.commonprefix([full\_path, directory]) != directory: |
| --- | --- |
|  | # Don't allow misbehaving clients to break out of the static files |
|  | # directory. |

As stated in the Python documentation (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.commonprefix>) this function returns the longest prefix common to paths.

When passing a path like `/static/../static1.txt`, `os.path.commonprefix([full_path, directory])` returns `./static` which is the common part of `./static1.txt` and `./static`, It refers to `/static/../static1.txt` because it is considered in the staticfiles directory. As a result, it becomes possible to view files that should not be open to the public.

The solution is to use `os.path.commonpath` as the Python documentation explains that `os.path.commonprefix` works a character at a time, it does not treat the arguments as paths.

### PoC

In order to reproduce the issue, you need to create the following structure:

```
├── static
│   ├── index.html
├── static_disallow
│   ├── index.html
└── static1.txt

```

And run the `Starlette` app with:

```
import uvicorn
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles

routes = [
    Mount("/static", app=StaticFiles(directory="static", html=True), name="static"),
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

And running the commands:

```
curl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static_disallow/'
curl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static1.txt'
```

The `static1.txt` and the directory `static_disallow` are exposed.

### Impact

Confidentiality is breached: An attacker may obtain files that should not be open to the public.

### Credits

Security researcher **Masashi Yamane of LAC Co., Ltd** reported this vulnerability to **JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Coordination Group** and they contacted us to coordinate a patch for the security issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
