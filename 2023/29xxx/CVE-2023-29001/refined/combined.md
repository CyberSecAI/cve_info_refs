Prevent IPv6 SRH processing when the next hop is our own address, or an invalid address for forwarding. This prevents a bug that causes deep recursive calls that occur because of the way that uIP processes packets.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi!  This was my mistake, very sorry about it, re-opening this PR now.  What happened is the following: I was switching the base branch for this repository <https://github.com/wittra/contiki-ng> from develop to wittra. But accidentally, I made the change on the wrong repo (this repo) and instead of switching the base branch I renamed it. And somehow github deleted develop and closed all PRs...  Many apologies for this mishap üôè; I haven't contributed in a while.. but now at least everybody got some notification from me :p |

### **[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)** commented [Oct 27, 2023](#issuecomment-1783030297)

| Maybe we should add a validation loop in the extension header processing code? RFC 6554 says: " To detect loops in the SRH, a router MUST determine if the SRH includes multiple addresses assigned to any interface on that router. If such addresses appear more than once and are separated by at least one address not assigned to that router, the router MUST drop the packet" |

| Hi there,  are there any updates on the fix? There is an advisory draft CVE-2023-29001. The preliminary title seems to be "Uncontrolled recursion due to insufficient validation of the IPv6 source routing header". It would be great to have that published in the process as well. :-)  Best Tobi |

# Uncontrolled recursion due to insufficient validation of the IPv6 source routing header

High

[nfi](/nfi)
published
GHSA-7p75-mf53-ffwm
Nov 27, 2024

## Package

os/net/ipv6

## Affected versions

<= 4.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations.

The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip\_ipv6\_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow.

### Patches

The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release.

### Workarounds

The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [#2264](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2264).
