Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-29501

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Jiyu Kukan Toku-Toku coupon" app for both iOS and Android versions 3.5.0 and earlier is vulnerable to improper server certificate verification. This means the app does not properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate during encrypted communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-295:** Improper Certificate Validation. The application fails to correctly verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to eavesdrop on encrypted communications between the app and the server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive user data such as login credentials, personal information, and other data transmitted by the app.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack: The attacker intercepts communication between the app and the server. This is typically done by placing a malicious Wi-Fi access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's device and the server. This could involve setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point or compromising a legitimate network.
- The attacker must have the capability to impersonate the legitimate server using a malicious certificate

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both the iOS and Android versions of the app.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 6.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N), indicating a network-based attack with high confidentiality impact.
- The vendor has released an update to address the vulnerability, users are advised to update to the latest version.
- Workarounds include using the app on trusted networks like carrier networks or trusted WiFi access points.
