Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-29043:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled image references within presentations. Specifically, the `imageSrc` attribute wasn't properly encoded, allowing for the injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By embedding malicious script code in the `imageSrc` attribute of a presentation, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a user's browser when they interact with the presentation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** When a user opens or edits a presentation containing the malicious `imageSrc` attribute, the embedded script code will execute. This could allow attackers to:
    *   Steal session cookies and impersonate the user.
    *   Modify the content of the presentation.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Perform other actions within the user's browser with the same privileges as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to deliver a crafted presentation to the victim user.
*  **User Interaction:**  The vulnerability is triggered by user interaction, specifically when the user edits or performs actions such as copying content within a document that contains the malicious image reference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify presentation documents to insert the malicious `imageSrc` attribute.
*  The attacker does not need high privileges, and the attack can be initiated by any authenticated user.
*   The attacker needs to entice a victim to open or interact with the malicious presentation document in order to execute the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to the processing of presentations (e.g., PowerPoint-like files) and how image references are handled.
* The vulnerability is a medium severity according to CVSS 3.1 score.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version `7.10.6-rev8` of OX App Suite office.

In summary, CVE-2023-29043 is an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by injecting it into presentations through the `imageSrc` attribute. Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking or content manipulation.
