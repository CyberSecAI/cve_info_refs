Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Document` script API directly returning a `DocumentAuthors` object. This object allows setting arbitrary authors to a document, bypassing permission checks. The issue was introduced by the `Document#getAuthors()` method which directly returned `XWikiDocument#getAuthors()` without a wrapper to protect the setter methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The `DocumentAuthors` object, when obtained through the script API, provides methods that can modify document authorship. This leads to privilege escalation because it does not enforce proper authorization checks before modifying the author.
*   **Unprotected API:** The script API exposed functionality (`DocumentAuthors#set*` calls) that should have been protected or wrapped with a safe implementation.
*   **Direct Object Access:** The `Document#getAuthors()` method was directly returning the internal `XWikiDocument#getAuthors()` object, which allows modifications to the cached document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the document author to a privileged user (e.g., `xwiki:XWiki.superadmin`), an attacker with script execution rights (but not programming rights) can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the impersonated user.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to set the author allows the attacker to inject and execute malicious script content as the impersonated privileged user.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the attacker impersonates a super administrator, they could potentially gain full control over the XWiki platform.
*   **Data Modification and Access:** With elevated privileges, the attacker can modify document content, access sensitive data, or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Script Injection:** The primary attack vector is injecting malicious script code into a document.
*   **API Misuse:** The attacker leverages the improperly secured `DocumentAuthors` object obtained from the `Document` script API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Script Execution Rights:** The attacker must have the ability to execute scripts within the XWiki environment. This usually implies having "SCRIPT" rights, which is a lower level of privilege than "PROGRAMMING".
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the XWiki API and how the `DocumentAuthors` object can be manipulated.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by code similar to the following:
    ```velocity
    {{velocity}}
    $doc.setContent('{{velocity}}$xcontext.context.authorReference{{/velocity}}')
    $doc.authors.setContentAuthor('xwiki:XWiki.superadmin')
    $doc.getRenderedContent()
    {{/velocity}}
    ```
    This script first sets a payload into the document content, then it modifies the author, and then gets the rendered content which will be executed in the context of the modified author, leading to privilege escalation.
*   The fix involves wrapping the `DocumentAuthors` object with a `SafeDocumentAuthors` implementation. This safe version prevents any setter methods from modifying the actual document authors, thus preventing the exploit.
* The commit `905cdd7c421dbf8c565557cdc773ab1aa9028f83` addresses the issue by:
    *   Introducing `SafeDocumentAuthors` which throws `UnsupportedOperationException` on all setter methods.
    *   Modifying the `Document#getAuthors()` to return a `SafeDocumentAuthors` instance when the current user does not have `PROGRAM` rights, ensuring only users with programming rights can get direct access to the underlying authors object.
    *   Using `getDoc().getAuthors()` when saving instead of `this.getAuthors()` to prevent privilege escalation via author change.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was a regression caused by the introduction of the `Document#getAuthors()` method.
*  The fix was released in XWiki versions 14.10 and 14.4.7.

In summary, CVE-2023-29507 is a critical vulnerability in XWiki that allows privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution due to a flaw in the way document authors are handled through the script API. The fix involves introducing a safe wrapper around the `DocumentAuthors` object and modifying the way the object is returned by the API.
