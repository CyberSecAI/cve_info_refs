In SAP NetWeaver (BI CONT ADDON) - versions 707, 737, 747, 757, an attacker can exploit a directory traversal flaw in a report toÂ upload and overwrite files on the SAP server. Data cannot be read but if a remote attacker has sufficient (administrative) privileges then potentially critical OS files can be overwritten making the system unavailable.
