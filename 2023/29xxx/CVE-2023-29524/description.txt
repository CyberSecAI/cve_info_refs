A user without script or programming rights, edit your user profile with the object editor and add a new object of type XWiki.SchedulerJobClass, In "Job Script", groovy code can be added and will be executed in the server context on viewing. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.3 and 15.0 RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
