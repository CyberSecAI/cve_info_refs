# Privilege escalation (PR) from account through XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-fc42-5w56-qw7h
Apr 18, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-scheduler-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

2.0.1

## Patched versions

14.10.3, 15.0-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

It's possible to execute anything with the right of the Scheduler Application sheet page.

To reproduce:

1. As a user without script or programming rights, edit your user profile with the object editor and add a new object of type XWiki.SchedulerJobClass (search for "Scheduler")
2. In "Job Script", add the following

   `{{/code}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy} {{/async}}`
3. Click "Save & View"
4. If the job information isn't already displayed (you should see "Job Name", "Job Description", etc.), append ?sheet=XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet to the URL.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.3 and 15.0 RC1.

### Workarounds

While the fix in the scheduler itself is easy, it relies on the code macro `source` parameter, which was introduced in 14.10.2 so you have to upgrade to benefit from it.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20295>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

The idea is to add a parameter in the code macro to get the content to highlight from a dynamic source instead of the macro content.

See <https://forum.xwiki.org/t/new-parameter-in-code-macro-taking-the-reference-of-a-content-to-display/11491> for the proposal.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or programming rights, edit your user profile with the object editor and add a new object of type XWiki.SchedulerJobClass (search for "Scheduler").
2. In "Job Script", add the following
   ```
   {{/code}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
   ```
3. Click "Save & View"
4. If the job information isn't already displayed (you should see "Job Name", "Job Description", etc.), append ?sheet=XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet to the URL.

**Expected result:**

Under "Job script" the text

```
{{/code}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
```

is displayed.

**Actual result:**

Under "Job script", the text

```
 Hello from groovy!{{/code}}
```

is displayed.

This shows that a user without script or programming rights has successfully executed a Groovy macro and thus gained programming rights. Therefore, this is a privilege escalation vulnerability from account to programming rights.
