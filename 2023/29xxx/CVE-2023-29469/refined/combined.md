Package        : libxml2
Version        : 2.9.4+dfsg1-7+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28484 CVE-2023-29469

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files.

CVE-2023-28484

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw when parsing invalid XML schemas may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-29469

    It was reported that when hashing empty strings which aren't
    null-terminated, xmlDictComputeFastKey could produce inconsistent
    results, which may lead to various logic or memory errors.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.4+dfsg1-7+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>

# [CVE-2023-29469] Hashing of empty dict strings isn't deterministic

When given an empty string, `xmlDictComputeFastKey` uses the first byte of the string to compute the hash value. Most of the time the strings are null-terminated. But it can happen that the string is part of a larger buffer and the byte is essentially random. This can lead to all kinds of logic or memory errors. For example, OSS-Fuzz reported a double-free caused by this bug.
