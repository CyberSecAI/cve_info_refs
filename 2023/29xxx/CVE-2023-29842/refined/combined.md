# Description

The endpoint **/EditEventTypes.php** is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection (Time-based) via the **EN\_tyid** POST parameter.

This endpoint can be triggered through the following menu: Events - List Event Types - Edit Event Types - Save Name. The EN\_tyid Parameter is taken directly from the user input and passed into the SQL query without any sanitization or input escaping. This allows the attacker to inject malicious Event payloads to execute the malicious SQL query.

# Proof of Concept

Triggering response delays with MySQL sleep function through **Time-based SQL Injection**.

**Affected Parameter**: EN\_tyid

**Payload**: ' OR SLEEP(5)#

```
POST /churchcrm/EditEventTypes.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8888
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/111.0

EN_tyid=1'+OR+SLEEP(5)%23&EN_ctid=&newEvtName=NewEvent&Action=NAME&newEvtStartTime=10%3A30%3A00&newCountName=

```

# Root Cause

User input on the Event parameter is not sanitized and used directly in the query through string concatenation.
<https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/blob/master/src/EditEventTypes.php#L33,L71>

# Recommendation

Avoid direct string concatenation into the sql query. It's recommended to use input sanitization as well as implementing parameterized query.

# Description
The endpoint \*\*/EditEventTypes.php\*\* is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection (Time-based) via the \*\*EN\_tyid\*\* POST parameter.
This endpoint can be triggered through the following menu: Events - List Event Types - Edit Event Types - Save Name. The EN\_tyid Parameter is taken directly from the user input and passed into the SQL query without any sanitization or input escaping. This allows the attacker to inject malicious Event payloads to execute the malicious SQL query.
# Proof of Concept
Triggering response delays with MySQL sleep function through \*\*Time-based SQL Injection\*\*.
\*\*Affected Parameter\*\*: EN\_tyid
\*\*Payload\*\*: ' OR SLEEP(5)#
```
POST /churchcrm/EditEventTypes.php HTTP/1.1

```
# Root Cause
User input on the Event parameter is not sanitized and used directly in the query through string concatenation.
https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/blob/master/src/EditEventTypes.php#L33,L71
# Recommendation
Avoid direct string concatenation into the sql query. It's recommended to use input sanitization as well as implementing parameterized query.

# Exploit Title: ChurchCRM 4.5.4 - Authenticated Blind SQL Injection via the EN\_tyid POST parameter
# Date: 03-05-2023
# Exploit Author: Arvandy
# Blog Post: https://github.com/arvandy/CVE/blob/main/CVE-2023-29842/CVE-2023-29842.md
# Software Link: https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/releases
# Vendor Homepage: http://churchcrm.io/
# Version: 4.5.4
# Tested on: Windows, Linux
# CVE: CVE-2023-29842
"""
The endpoint /EditEventTypes.php is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection (Time-based) via the EN\_tyid POST parameter.
This endpoint can be triggered through the following menu: Events - List Event Types - Edit Event Types - Save Name.
The EN\_tyid Parameter is taken directly from the user input and passed into the SQL query without any sanitization or input escaping.
This allows the attacker to inject malicious Event payloads to execute the malicious SQL query.
This script is created as Proof of Concept to retrieve the database name and version.
