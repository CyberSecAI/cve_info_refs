  "response": {
    "root_cause": "User input on the `EN_tyid` parameter is not sanitized and is used directly in the SQL query through string concatenation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection (Time-based)",
      "Lack of input sanitization or escaping",
       "Direct string concatenation into SQL queries"

    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL payloads to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, by using time-based injection and observe response delays based on SQL SLEEP() function.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/EditEventTypes.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `EN_tyid` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have an authenticated session (valid `CRM-2c90cf299230a50dab55aee824ed9b08` cookie) to access the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to navigate to the \"Events - List Event Types - Edit Event Types - Save Name\" menu to trigger the vulnerable request."
