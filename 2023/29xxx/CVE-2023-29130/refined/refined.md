- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access controls in the configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain admin access, leading to complete device control, and thus a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N), Low complexity (AC:L), Low Privileges Required(PR:L), No User Interaction(UI:N), Scope Changed (S:C), High Confidentiality impact (C:H), High Integrity impact (I:H), High Availability impact (A:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-level network access to the device.
