- **Root cause of vulnerability**: mySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior have parameters that allow an authenticated user to inject arbitrary operating system commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, system disruption, and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is performed remotely through vulnerable parameters within the mySCADA myPRO application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the mySCADA myPRO system. The attack has low complexity and can be performed remotely. Public exploits are available.
