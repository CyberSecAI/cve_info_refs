Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-29721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a file upload mechanism in SofaWiki that doesn't properly validate the `referer` header, allowing direct uploads of PHP files by matching the referer.
*   Specifically, the `uploadbigfile` action in `index.php` includes `inc/special/uploadbigfile.php` if the user has the 'upload' right or if the `referer` matches the `$swBaseHrefFolder`, without proper validation.
*  The `uploadbigfile.php` script then allows arbitrary file uploads and checks if md5 checksum matches the file name, which can be bypassed by sending a different file name and checksum in separate requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application permits the upload of files without proper validation of file types or content.
*   **Insecure Referer Check:** The reliance on `stristr` to match the `referer` for access control is insufficient. It allows spoofing by including the required base path in the referer.
*   **Missing Checksum Validation**: The checksum is verified after the file is uploaded, which enables an attacker to upload a malicious file with a valid checksum using separate requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through crafted HTTP POST requests with a specific structure, referer, and file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable SofaWiki instance.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests with specific parameters, file uploads, and headers.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is present in SofaWiki version 3.8.9 and earlier.
* The vulnerability can be exploited by sending three requests.
    1. Initial file upload to get the md5 checksum.
    2. Send a request with the checksum as the filename and the malicious payload as file contents.
    3. Send a final request to compose the file and make it executable.
