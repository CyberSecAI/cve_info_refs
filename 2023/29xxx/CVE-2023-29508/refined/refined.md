Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags within the Live Data macro of XWiki. Specifically, the "html" displayer for a property within the Live Data macro doesn't sanitize HTML content, allowing the execution of arbitrary scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied data containing malicious script tags is stored and later executed within the context of another user's session.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The Live Data macro, when using the "html" displayer, fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied HTML content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content.
*   **Data Theft:** The injected script can steal sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or other user data.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially hijack user sessions.
*   **Defacement/Malicious Actions:** Attackers could modify the content of the page, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Live Data Macro Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML with JavaScript into the Live Data macro.
*   **User Profile or AWM:** This injection can occur in areas like a user's profile "about" section or in editable fields within an Application Within Minutes (AWM) page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges (i.e., without script rights) can introduce the XSS.
*   **Content Editing Access:** The attacker needs the ability to edit content that supports the Live Data macro.
*   **Interaction With Script-Privileged User:** The vulnerability is triggered only when a script-privileged user is the last to edit the page or content. This means an attacker without script rights can inject the malicious payload, and the XSS will execute when the content is displayed to others after it's been saved by a user with the correct rights.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability using the `<img>` tag's `onerror` attribute to execute an `alert(1)` script.
*   The issue affects XWiki versions >= 13.10.10, >= 14.7, and >= 14.9.
*   It has been fixed in XWiki versions 13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10.
*   The vulnerability is tracked in XWiki Jira as XWIKI-20312.
*   The severity is rated as high with a CVSS score of 8.9.
*   The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L`
