Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29523:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of dynamically evaluated code within the `display` method of the XWiki platform, specifically when rendering content with the HTML macro. The `display` method did not properly escape closing HTML macro tags, allowing for injection of arbitrary XWiki syntax.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Eval Injection:** The core vulnerability is an "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code" (CWE-95), also known as "Eval Injection". This occurs because the system evaluates content that should be treated as plain text, leading to the execution of injected code.
- **Inadequate HTML Macro Handling:** The `display` method, when rendering HTML content with the `{{html}}` macro, failed to properly escape the closing `{{/html}}` tag within the content. This allowed attackers to inject their own macro syntax, including potentially dangerous ones.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited rights (e.g., the ability to edit their own user profile) can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary script macros like Groovy and Python.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious script macros, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
- **Unrestricted Access:** The attacker gains unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents, allowing them to modify data, steal information, or cause further damage.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges from a normal user account to having programming rights.
- **Data Modification/Theft:** Attackers can modify, delete, or steal sensitive information stored in the wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Profile Editing:** An attacker can inject malicious code through fields in their user profile (e.g., the "about" section) that use the vulnerable `display` method.
- **App Within Minutes Applications:** Applications created using the "App Within Minutes" feature are also vulnerable because they rely on the same `display` method.
- **Any field using display:** Any context where the vulnerable display method is used to display a field with wiki syntax is potentially vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs minimal privileges, such as the ability to edit their own user profile, to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** No special user interaction is required to trigger the exploit. The code executes automatically when the vulnerable content is rendered.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `XWikiDocument.java` file, specifically the `display` method.
- The fix involves escaping the closing HTML macro syntax, replacing occurrences of `{{/html}}` with `&#123;&#123;/html}}`.
- The vulnerability was found in versions of XWiki between 3.3-milestone-1 and 13.10.11, between 14.0-rc-1 and 14.4.8 and between 14.5 and 14.10.1.
