- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `subinfo_decode` and `unsubinfo_decode` functions. This happens while the broker is parsing MQTT packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability (CWE-476)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A segment fault occurs leading to a crash, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted MQTT packet to the broker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the MQTT broker, which is accessible on port 1883. The provided code snippet uses a simple TCP socket to send the crafted payload.
