Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses the `swSimpleSanitize()` function to sanitize user input, specifically the `name` parameter from the request.
- The `swSimpleSanitize()` function only filters out `<` and `>` characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `name` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided description labels the impact as "Low". However, successful XSS exploitation can lead to various impacts including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Stealing of user data

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `name` parameter.
-  An attacker can craft a URL like: `http://*.*.*.*/index.php?name=test%22%20onmouseover=alert(/xss/);%22` and induce a victim to click on it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to induce a victim to click on the malicious link in order to execute the injected javascript.
