# HTTP header parsing could cause a deny of service

published
GHSA-7hj9-rv74-5g92
Apr 11, 2023

## Package

gomod

Go
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.20.2

## Patched versions

1.20.3

gomod

Traefik
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

<= 2.9.9, <= 2.10.0-rc1

2.9.10, v2.10.0-rc2

## Description

### Impact

There is a vulnerability in [Go when parsing the HTTP headers](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8/m/OV40vnafAwAJ), which impacts Traefik.

HTTP header parsing could allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. This behavior could be exploited to cause a denial of service.
