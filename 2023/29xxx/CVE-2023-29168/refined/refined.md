Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-29168:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The local Vuforia web application does not support HTTPS, and federated credentials are passed via basic authentication. This leads to insufficient protection of credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** Credentials are transmitted without encryption (no HTTPS) and using basic authentication, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could view transmitted credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network eavesdropping:** An attacker positioned on the network can intercept the unencrypted credentials transmitted via basic authentication.
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept traffic.
*   Low attack complexity is required.
