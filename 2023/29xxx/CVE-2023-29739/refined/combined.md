September 12, 2019Alarms are loud but not loud enough to wake up my parents in the next room. 👍 They go off at the exact time I want them too.👍 The snooze and turn off alarm buttons are coloured big and clear.👍 The sleep schedule notifications are very useful. 👍 The options for what you can do in the app are easy to understand. 👍 The settings are easy to change.👍 I am new to this app and I recently found out that there is more to do on it. After I check that out I might edit this. If I can.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamSeptember 13, 2019Thank you so much! If there is anything we could help you with just send a message please with the Help and feedback menu fo the app, thanks!![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLuIkNCx-PLzmD3L_1YUDxBXW5DPJHuh1nC-Isa0PrvbRiXqQ=s32-rw-mo)I like pie*more\_vert*

February 15, 2021Deleting it because it constantly just decides to never go off despite having 3 alarms set. Have been late constantly over a few years just because this alarm randomly doesn't go off. Even when you go In to history it says last alarm 3 days ago and no explication why it didn't go off that day. Absolute shite. If this didn't happen it would be a great app.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamMarch 5, 2021Really sorry to hear that. Would you please send a message with the Help and feedback menu of the app? This is most probably related to battery optimizations an we'd love to try to help.

September 28, 2018Worked without fail in the two weeks I've been using it. The need to scam a bar code actually has me get you in the morning to open the light at the other side of my bedroom to stop the alarm from not shutting up, which is the first time am alarm makes me do that, so it's great. I would love to see a stopwatch or a timer added to the app, which would make it even more perfect, but as an alarm in and of itself it is great.Did you find this helpful?YesNoSmart Alarm Clock TeamSeptember 29, 2018Thank you so much for your great feedback! (you can add timer alarms if you select the Countdown Timer recurrence type - just send a message with the Help and feedback menu of the app please so we could help you)See all reviews

## An alarm clock with unlimited, fully customizable alarm profiles

Recurring alarms - on top of the basic settings, you can use advanced recurrence, such as
daily or weekly repeats, intervals, set expiration, etc. (ideal for shift workers working in
cycles)

One-time alarms - set any date

Countdown alarms - perfect for an afternoon siesta or zizz

## Each alarm has its own settings

Wake up and start your morning routine with your favorite song along with real-time weather
information

Use challenges (Math, Captcha, Wi-Fi, NFC) to prevent oversleeping - great for heavy
sleepers

Adjust snooze time on the fly - for the snoozy ones

Restrict alarms to locations

Many more features to tweak your alarms, yet you can familiarize yourself with it in a
timely manner

## Android Wear integration

Snooze or dismiss alarms right from your wrist. Adjust next alarm or add new one-time
alarms, using voice commands.

## Let you sleep on off-days

Ever been roused from a good, deep sleep on a public holiday, just because the alarm clock
wasn't turned off? AMdroid knows the public holidays for your country; alarms wonât go off
on these days (optional).

## Wake up during light sleep

Awakening from a good, deep sleep can cause enervation. Configure a gentle pre-alarm that
will go off before the main one. By utilizing sleep cycle calculation following your
biorhythm it can be scheduled automatically according to your sleep patterns. Lower the
volume and disable vibrating for this pre-alarm, so it'll only wake you if you are in light
sleep for a better morning routine start. This can help defend against sleepiness and
lethargy in the mornings. Wake up easily; be energetic and zestful!

## No more oversleep with this alarm clock

Can't wake up? Configure dismiss challenges to wake up timely. Use post alarm confirmation
to make sure you are awake and avoid oversleeping. Perfect alarm clock for heavy sleepers.

## Places

Make your alarm clock location-aware, so your alarms will only go off if you are in a
certain area. Heading out for a business trip or just sleep over somewhere else for the
night? Your morning routine will probably change, so AMdroid will temporarily disable your
regular alarm profile automatically.

## Sleep mode

To avoid oversleep you need to go to bed timely. AMdroid will let you know with a bedtime
(sleep advise) notification if it's time to fall asleep in order to wake up fresh and have a
better morning routine. When sleep mode is activated sleep cycle calculation can be started
to follow your sleep patterns and have an easier awakening in the morning. With Stats, you
can also track how much time you spend sleeping.

## Nothing better than an afternoon siesta

Tiredness overcame and feel drowsy? If you are sleepy or half asleep, use the countdown
alarm function as a timer for your afternoon doze. Set the timer, and the alarm will go off
if it has elapsed, and you won't oversleep. Awaken energized and lively.

## Stats

Ever wondered how much time you spend snoozing? AMdroid Smart Alarm Clock will show you
statistics, you can analyze and use to fine-tune your alarm settings.
