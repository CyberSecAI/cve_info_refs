Updated over 2 months agoTable of contents

**Overview**

**TeraCopy** is a file transfer utility designed to copy and move files efficiently within your Windows operating system. One common question users have is whether TeraCopy requires a network or internet connection to function properly.

## **Network Connection Requirements**

**File Operations**

‚Ä¢ **Local and Network Shares**: TeraCopy operates using the standard ReadFile and WriteFile Win32 APIs provided by Windows. This means it can copy and move files both on your local machine and over network shares that are accessible to the current user.

‚Ä¢ **User Permissions**: The application can only access network locations (such as shared folders on other computers) that the logged-in user has permission to access. It does not bypass or alter any network security settings or permissions.

## **Internet Access**

‚Ä¢ **Updater Component**: TeraCopy does not require an internet connection for its core functionality of copying and moving files. However, the internet is needed for the updater.exe component, which is part of the Advanced Installer package used by TeraCopy.

‚Ä¢ **Automatic Updates**: The updater.exe file checks for software updates to ensure you have the latest features and security patches.

‚Ä¢ **Optional Usage**: If your organization‚Äôs policies restrict internet access for applications, you can disable the automatic update feature or configure your firewall to block the updater.exe from accessing the internet.

## **Security Considerations**

‚Ä¢ **No Unauthorized Access**: TeraCopy does not grant any additional network access beyond what is available to the user in Windows Explorer.

‚Ä¢ **Data Transfer**: All data transfers occur under the same security context as the user, ensuring that standard network security protocols are upheld.

## **Recommendations**

‚Ä¢ **For Organizations**: Review and configure TeraCopy‚Äôs settings to align with your security requirements. Disable or control the updater component if internet access is restricted.

‚Ä¢ **For Users**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access any network shares you intend to use with TeraCopy.

An Invalid Vulnerability Report

 Updated over 2 months ago

It references two sources:

1. **[https://securityandstuff.com/posts/teracopy\_arbitrary\_read](https://securityandstuff.com/posts/teracopy_arbitrary_read/)** (no longer available)

The author reported that TeraCopy 3.9.7 allowed copying folders that regular users typically lack permissions to access. However, the TeraCopy service enforces a check for admin privileges. As demonstrated in the video, non-admin users are unable to access restricted files and folders.

2. **<https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/143984/TeraCopyService-3.1-Unquoted-Service-Path-Privilege-Escalation.html>**

Strangely, this CVE also links to a separate issue in TeraCopy 3.1 (released in 2017). The video at timestamp [0:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrOHtWWFhJI&t=18s) confirms that version 3.9.7 does not exhibit this vulnerability, as it was resolved in version 3.5b.
