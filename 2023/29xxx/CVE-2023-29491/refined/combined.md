(distros maintain "downstream" versions of the ncurses "upstream")

Ideally, a security patch should only include security relevant changes.
If a bunch of a documentation or miscellaneous changes are added, it
makes backporting difficult (i.e., the non-security relevant changes may
not be desired or cause the patch to not apply cleanly to old versions
of ncurses). The upstream patch is already made, but that's what I'd
recommend for future patches. If there's a regression as Alice suggests,
that might be a good opportunity to redo the patch format.

<http://ncurses.scripts.mit.edu/?p=ncurses.git;a=commit;h=eb51b1ea1f75a0ec17c9c5937cb28df1e8eeec56>

When you publish the CVE json5, you can references the patch URL and
relevant bug discussions to help downstream. Including the CVE number in
the patch commit is also quite helpful.

Thank you!

Are there any plans to disclose any proofs of concept to test these
issues? From the distro side these are not only useful to check which
ncurses snapshots we need to fix, but also for our QA teams to test the
update and detect regressions.

For example, we are not sure if the build option
`--disable-root-environ` does anything to mitigate the issues.

For what is worth, we have not been contacted, as far as I can tell.

Package        : ncurses
Version        : 6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-39537 CVE-2023-29491
Debian Bug     : 1034372

Issues were found in ncurses, a collection of shared libraries for
terminal handling, which could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2021-39537

    It has been discovered that the tic(1) utility is susceptible to a
    heap overflow on crafted input due to improper bounds checking.

CVE-2023-29491

    Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse and Emanuele Cozzi have discovered
    that when ncurses is used by a setuid application, a local user can
    trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed data in a
    terminfo database file found in $HOME/.terminfo or reached via the
    TERMINFO or TERM environment variables.

    In order to mitigate this issue, ncurses now further restricts
    programs running with elevated privileges (setuid/setgid programs).
    Programs run by the superuser remain able to load custom terminfo
    entries.

    This change aligns ncurses' behavior in buster-security with that of
    Debian Bullseye's latest point release (6.2+20201114-2+deb11u2).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
6.1+20181013-2+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your ncurses packages.

For the detailed security status of ncurses please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ncurses>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: RE: [EXTERNAL] Re: ncurses fixes upstream

Yes, now that the cat is out of the bag there's no point - you can find some POCs here (not every find is covered by a POC, FYI):
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XZiHbH7W7is8cwTu7DKrpwBTYuYfRZqE>

Note not all of them work on Linux - some are macOS focused too.

As for Taviso's remark - obviously using "iprog", "rf" or "if" capabilities can be used maliciously if an attacker is able to affect root's terminfo files (directly or with env-vars), but those capabilities are only used by a bunch of programs (e.g. reset, tput and others). Normally putting an "iprog" and calling another ncurses using binary (e.g. top) won't run that program.
To be honest, we focused on EoP scenarios, and specifically macOS. macOS is the most sensitive here, since "top" is a SUID binary and doesn't sanitize TERMINFO (or HOME, which can be used too). The bus we found are several memory corruption issues that happen during terminfo db parsing, as well as ncurses functions (e.g. tparm).

Are there any plans to disclose any proofs of concept to test these issues? From the distro side these are not only useful to check which ncurses snapshots we need to fix, but also for our QA teams to test the update and detect regressions.

For example, we are not sure if the build option `--disable-root-environ` does anything to mitigate the issues.

For what is worth, we have not been contacted, as far as I can tell.

Subject: ncurses fixes upstream

Hello oss-security,

Our team has worked with the maintainer of the ncurses library (used by several software packages in Linux) to fix several memory corruption vulnerabilities.
They are now fixed at commit 20230408 - see details here (<https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20230408>)
A CVE was assigned (CVE-2023-29491) - it's still under a "reserved" status.

How can we ensure those fixes get deployed upstream, in major Linux distributions?
We've reached out to Arch, RedHat, Canonical and other popular distros independently.

Thanks!
                             JBO

```
