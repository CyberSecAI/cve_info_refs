Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-29311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak. While not as severe as arbitrary code execution, memory leaks can cause denial-of-service conditions or expose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L). This implies that an attacker needs local access to the system or have the victim open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N).
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the victim must perform an action like opening a specially crafted file for the attack to succeed.
