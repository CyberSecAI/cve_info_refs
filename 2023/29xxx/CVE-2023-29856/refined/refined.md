{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is in the parsing of the HTTP request header with the query field as input within the `scandir.sgi` binary. There is no proper validation process in the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a Post-Authentication Buffer Overflow attack.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending more data than the fixed-length stack buffer can hold within the HTTP request header's query field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device and be authenticated. "
