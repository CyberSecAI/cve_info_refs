Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an arbitrary factory reset vulnerability found in the WAVLINK Wi-Fi APP. The specific cause of the vulnerability is not detailed within the content provided but stems from a flaw in how the application handles requests to the `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary Factory Reset:** The core weakness is the ability for an attacker to trigger a factory reset remotely without proper authorization or authentication. This suggests a lack of access control or insufficient validation of requests to the `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can force a factory reset on a device, disrupting its normal operation. The device would lose all user configurations and require manual setup.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be initiated remotely, meaning an attacker doesn't need physical access to the device or local network access.
*   **HTTP Request to `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi`:** The specific attack vector is through sending an HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi` endpoint with an access path HTTP status code equal to 200.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device which would include devices exposed to the Internet.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** Attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint path `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi`
* **HTTP Request Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected firmware version is RPT70HA1.x.
*   The web server used by the application is lighttpd/1.4.20.
