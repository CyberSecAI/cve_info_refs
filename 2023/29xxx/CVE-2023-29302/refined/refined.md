- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).  The attack requires a low level of privilege (PR:L) to be initiated. The attacker needs to induce a user to click on a crafted link (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing a payload that will be executed in the victim's browser.
