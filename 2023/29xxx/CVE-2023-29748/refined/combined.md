## About this app

*arrow\_forward*Yandex Navigator helps drivers plot the optimal route to their destination. The app takes traffic jams, accidents, road works, and other road events into account when plotting your route. Yandex Navigator will present you with up to three variants of your journey, starting with the fastest. If your selected journey takes you over toll roads, the app will warn you about this in advance.

Yandex. Navigator uses voice prompts to guide you along your way, and displays your route on your device‚Äôs screen. Additionally, you can always see how many minutes and kilometers you have to go.
You can use your voice to interact with Yandex Navigator so that you don't have to take your hands off the wheel. Just say "Hey, Yandex" and the app will start listening for your commands. For example, "Hey, Yandex, let's go to 1 Lesnaya Street" or "Hey, Yandex, take me to Domodedovo Airport". You can also let Navigator know about road events you encounter (such as "Hey, Yandex, there is an accident in the right lane") or search for locations on the map (by simply saying "Hey, Yandex, Red Square").
Save time by choosing recent destinations from your history. Look through your recent destinations and favorites from any of your devices‚Äîthey are saved in the cloud and available when and where you need them.
Yandex Navigator will guide you to your destinations in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Turkey.

Yandex Navigator is a navigation app, which doesn't have any functions related to healthcare or medicine.

The app suggests enabling the Yandex search widget for the notification panel.Updated onJan 9, 2025Travel & Local

November 11, 2024Happy user for 10+ years but app needs one fix: When you're driving on the highway, it wants you to use access roads, parallel roads all the time even though highway itself is empty and green.. Unnecessary notifications and directions all the time when you should really have to just follow the highway..5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoDirect Cursus Computer Systems Trading LLCNovember 11, 2024Currently, the app does not have the ability to disable the faster route suggestion.
