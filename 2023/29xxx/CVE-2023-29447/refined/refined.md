Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-29447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The KEPServerEX Configuration web server uses basic authentication to protect user credentials. This method transmits credentials in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Insufficiently protected credentials. The web server does not use encryption and sends the username and password in plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can obtain plaintext credentials by performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack via ARP spoofing. This could lead to unauthorized access and potentially further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack via ARP spoofing on the local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable KEPServerEX system. They also need the ability to perform ARP spoofing. User interaction is required for the attack to succeed. Specifically, the user must authenticate to the KEPServerEX Configuration web server while the attacker is conducting the MitM attack.
