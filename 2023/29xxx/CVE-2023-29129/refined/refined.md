- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mendix SAML module insufficiently verifies SAML assertions. This is due to an incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm. Specifically, this CVE addresses an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-25957 in a non-default configuration where encryption is disabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient verification of SAML assertions, leading to an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the application. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential manipulation of application data.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SAML assertions to the application. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user interaction.
