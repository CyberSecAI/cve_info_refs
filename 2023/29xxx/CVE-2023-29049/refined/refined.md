Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-29049:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the "upsell" widget on the portal page did not properly sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of proper input sanitization allows injection of arbitrary script code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers could inject malicious script code to achieve persistent code execution within a trusted domain. This could allow them to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.
*   Attackers could compromise user accounts by injecting script code through a compromised account, or temporary access to a legitimate account.
*   The exploitation could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based attack.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious script code into the "upsell" widget.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Low privileges are required.
*   User interaction is required (the attacker needs to lure users to a compromised account or have temporary access to inject the script).
*   The attacker needs access to an account within the vulnerable system, either compromised or legitimate.
