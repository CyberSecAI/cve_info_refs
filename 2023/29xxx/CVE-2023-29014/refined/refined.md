Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Goobi viewer core handles the `LOGID` parameter. Specifically, the application was not properly sanitizing or validating the `LOGID` parameter before using it in the application.

**Weaknesses:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application reflects the unsanitized `LOGID` parameter directly back to the user, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `LOGID` parameter. If a user clicks on this link, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This could allow the attacker to:
  - Steal cookies or session tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
  - Redirect the user to malicious websites.
  - Modify the content of the web page.
  - Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `LOGID` parameter.
- The user must be tricked into clicking this malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL and entice the victim to click the malicious link. This could be achieved via phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or any other method where a user can be manipulated into clicking a specific link.
- No direct access to the server is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows that the fix implemented involves adding a regular expression check to only allow the `logid` parameter to contain alphanumeric characters or hyphens: `logid.matches("[\\w-]+")`. This helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected via the `LOGID` parameter.
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 23.03 and was patched in version 23.03.
- The report was made by RUS-CERT.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
