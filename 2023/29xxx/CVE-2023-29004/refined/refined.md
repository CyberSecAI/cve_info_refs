- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `get_config` function of the `/app/modules/config/config.py` file. It insufficiently checks for path traversal, allowing the reading of files from absolute paths provided via the `config_file_name` parameter. This is due to an insufficient patch of CVE-2023-25802.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-36)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can obtain the content of arbitrary files within the file server, leading to confidentiality breach.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP request to `/app/options.py` with the `config_file_name` parameter set to an absolute file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request.
