Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code (Eval Injection). The `wikiId` URL parameter in `WikiManager.DeleteWiki` was not properly escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Eval Injection (CWE-95):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `wikiId` parameter, intended to be a simple identifier, is used in a context where it is dynamically evaluated, without proper sanitization/escaping. This allows an attacker to inject code that will be interpreted and executed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with view rights on `WikiManager.DeleteWiki` can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python, or Velocity code on the XWiki server. This effectively allows them to gain full access to the XWiki installation, potentially compromising the entire system.
*   **Full System Access:** By executing arbitrary code, attackers can read, modify, or delete data, install backdoors, and potentially gain control of the underlying server infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `wikiId` parameter and sending an HTTP GET request to the `WikiManager/DeleteWiki` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **View Rights:** The attacker needs to have view rights on the `WikiManager.DeleteWiki` page.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XWiki instance.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** Some knowledge about XWiki's macro syntax is needed to craft the exploit payload.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper escaping of the `wikiId` parameter in the `DeleteWiki.xml` file.
*   The injected payload uses the `async`, `groovy` macros to execute arbitrary code.
*   The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions >= 5.3-milestone-2
*   The fix involves proper escaping of the `wikiId` parameter using `$services.rendering.escape($escapetool.java($wikiId), 'xwiki/2.1')` before it is used in the error message.
