{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `mrled` function, which is used during the decoding process. This occurs when the decoded block size is inconsistent with the expected size, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Unvalidated input leading to out-of-bounds read"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash, and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted bzip3 compressed file designed to trigger the heap-buffer-overflow during decompression.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious bzip3 file to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "bzip3 versions prior to 1.3.0 are affected. The specific issue was identified in v1.2.2.",
    "fixed_versions": "The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.3.0 of bzip3.",
    "patch_information": "The fix is in commit `aae16d107f804f69000c09cd92027a140968cc9d`, which implements a size check before decoding a block. This check ensures that the old_size is not larger than the block_size + 31, which would cause the overflow."
