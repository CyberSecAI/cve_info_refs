Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an **inadequate authorization check** in the `/job/list` endpoint. The application fails to properly verify if the user is authorized to access the job list information, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The vulnerability is a form of IDOR. By manipulating the `appId` parameter in the request to the `/job/list` endpoint, an attacker can access information related to different applications they should not have access to. The application does not validate the user's permissions against the provided `appId`.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The application does not implement proper authorization checks to ensure that only users with the required privileges can access job list information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view the job list information of any application by manipulating the `appId`, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive application data.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Access to job information can potentially expose internal details, such as task names, scheduling configurations or internal data flows, which can be leveraged to craft more advanced attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can craft a malicious HTTP POST request to `/job/list` endpoint and specify any `appId` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's `/job/list` endpoint.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to understand and modify HTTP requests, specifically parameters in a POST body.
*   No prior authentication is required, as stated by the user, the access is done by simply changing the ID.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported against PowerJob.
*   The attack is carried out via a POST request to the `/job/list` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to manipulate the `appId` parameter in the JSON body of the request.
*   The reported request is as follows:

```
