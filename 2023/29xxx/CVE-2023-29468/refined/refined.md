- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TI WiLink WL18xx MCP driver does not limit the number of information elements (IEs) of type XCC_EXT_1_IE_ID or XCC_EXT_2_IE_ID that can be parsed in a management frame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to lack of input validation on the number of IEs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution by overwriting memory of the host processor executing the MCP driver. The confidentiality and integrity impact can range from Low to High depending on system characteristics.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted management frame with an excessive number of XCC_EXT_1_IE_ID or XCC_EXT_2_IE_ID type IEs via wireless communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device and have the ability to send malicious management frames.
