  configuration files](#MiniTOCBookMark2)

You can configure the TFTP server from its web interface.

**To configure the TFTP server**

1. Point your browser to the TFTP server and its port number (for
   example, [http://spyhunter:8086](http://spyhunter:8086/)).
   The **Authentication Required** dialog box appears.

![](polycom_phone_features_config_tr_files/image002.jpg)

2. In the **User Name** and **Password** boxes, type the
   TFTP server credentials and then click **Log In**. The
   **TFTP Server About** configuration page appears.

![](polycom_phone_features_config_tr_files/image004.jpg)

3. From the menu bar, click **Settings** and then,
   in the left navigation of the **Settings** page, click
   **Parameters**. The **TFTP Server Parameters**
   page appears.

4. In **Allowed Upload Extensions**, do one of the
   following:

+ To add an allowed extension for files that can upload to
  the TFTP server, click **Add Value**.
+ To delete an allowed extension, click **Del**
  on the appropriate line.

The default value is log.

**Note:** Specify
an allowed extension without any prefix or period. For example, specify
`*.log` as `log` to allow only `*.log`
files to be uploaded. If **Allowed Upload Extensions** values
are not set or are blank, the TFTP server accepts any file name when the
server is configured for write or read/write mode.

5. In **Allowed Upload Sub Directories**, do one of
   the following:

+ To specify the name of a subdirectory in the TFTP server
  root directory that can accept files uploaded from the phones,
  click **Add Value**.
+ To delete the name of an allowed subdirectory, click **Del**
  on the appropriate line.

The default value is blank.

**Note:** Directory
names can contain only upper or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
Spaces and punctuation are not allowed.

**Warning!**

Physically create the appropriate subdirectories on the TFTP server
and identify them here. Phone logs, configuration files, or contact
directories cannot be saved until the subdirectories exist. Allowed
subdirectory names must match the ones used in the `<Ethernet
address>.cfg` files for each phones. For more information,
see [Modify the phone
configuration files](#Modify_the_phone_configuration_files).

6. In **IP Filters**, do one of the following:

+ To specify a range of IP addresses that have access to the
  TFTP server, click **Add Value**. The address range
  format is: `X.X.X.X-X.X.X.X`.
+ To delete an allowed IP address range, click **Del**
  on the appropriate line.

The default value is blank.

**Note:** Addresses
outside the ranges provided are not allowed access. You can specify multiple
address ranges.

**Warning!**

If no values are specified, access is
not limited.

7. In **TFTP Mode**, select the mode the TFTP server
   runs in. The possible settings are:

| **Read** | TFTP server sends files, but does not accept TFTP uploads. This setting is the most secure mode. |
| --- | --- |
| **Read and Write** | TFTP server allows upload and download of files. |
| **Write** | TFTP server accepts TFTP uploads, but does not allow phones to download files. This mode would almost never be used for supporting IP phones. |

8. In TFTP Root Path, specify the directory the TFTP server uses
   as its home or root directory.

**Default value:** `C:\I3\IC\TFTPRoot`

The CIC install creates this registry value
and sets it to `[i3 install disk][i3 install directory]\TFTPRoot`
(example: `D:\i3\ic\TFTPRoot`) and creates the directory automatically.

9. Do one of the following:

+ To save changes to the TFTP server
  configuration, click **Apply Changes**. The changes
  are effective immediately.
+ To discard your changes to the
  TFTP server configuration, click **Cancel**.

## Modify the phone configuration files

To direct the phone logs, contact directories, and overrides files to
the appropriate TFTP server subdirectories, also modify each `<Ethernet
address>.cfg` file.

Using an XML editor, supply the appropriate directory names in these
attributes:

* `LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY`
* `OVERRIDES_DIRECTORY`
* `CONTACTS_DIRECTORY`

# TFTPlunder: an exploit for CVE-2023-29930

This is an exploit script for a blind file read / write vulnerability in the Genesys (formerly InIn) TFTP provisioning server.

## Vulnerability info

This vulnerability is due to unrestricted configuration options for the TFTP root path and file extensions. In other words, from the Admin interface, you can change the TFTP to any directory at all and upload or download whatever files you want.

(Note however that TFTP as a protocol does not allow for file listing, which is what makes this a *Blind* file read vulnerability.)

It is particularly compounded by the fact that the server by default uses hardcoded known credentials and does not force the user to change them.

Classification-wise, it has aspects of the following CWEs:

* CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
* CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
* CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

All known versions to date are vulnerable.

## Mitigation

The best mitigation for now is simply to update the Admin credentials to the TFTP configuration server.

## Using this exploit

I'd recommend using this with either a Jupyer notebook or the Python REPL loop, or for more advanced use cases, writing your own script and importing this file.
Just import the main python file, instantiate the class, and call get\_file and put\_file as you please.

```
$ python3
>>> from tftplunder import TFTPlunder
>>> tp=TFTPlunder("example.com")
>>> tp.get_file("C:/Windows/Panther/Unattended.xml")
>>> tp.get_file("C:/ProgramData/ntuser.pol")

```

etcetera

hint: see <https://github.com/jtpereyda/regpol> for help decoding ntuser.pol

and see lists such as <https://github.com/soffensive/windowsblindread/blob/master/windows-files.txt> for examples of other files to try.
