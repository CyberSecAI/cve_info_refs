- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for a security feature bypass due to insufficient restrictions on authentication attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a security feature bypass which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any prior privileges or user interaction. They can perform the attack remotely. The attack requires a high complexity.
