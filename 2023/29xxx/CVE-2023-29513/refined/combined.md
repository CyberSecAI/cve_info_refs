## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 8.0-rc-1

## Patched versions

15.0-rc-1, 14.10.1

## Description

### Impact

If guest has view right on any document. It's possible to create a new user using the `distribution/firstadminuser.wiki` in the wrong context.

To reproduce:

* On a wiki with view rights for guests but user registration disabled, open as guest /xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Btemplate+name%3D%22distribution%2Ffirstadminuser.wiki%22+%2F%7D%7D where is the URL of your XWiki installation.
* Enter username and password of your choice.
* Click "Register and login"

Starting with XWiki 14.5 (or CKEditor contrib extension 1.64.3) you need to include a valid CSRF token.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1 and 14.10.1.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround other than upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. On a wiki with view rights for guests but user registration disabled, open as guest <server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Btemplate+name%3D%22distribution%2Ffirstadminuser.wiki%22+%2F%7D%7D where <server> is the URL of your XWiki installation.
2. Enter username and password of your choice.
3. Click "Register and login"

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed that registration is disabled/the distribution wizard cannot be executed.

**Actual result:**

You are logged in with the chosen login data. Note that also the user validation is skipped.

This is exploiting the same vulnerable template as [~~XWIKI-19558~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19558 "Users can be created without validation even when registration is disabled") but via a different attack vector that I didn't know/expect when I reported and fixed that issue.
