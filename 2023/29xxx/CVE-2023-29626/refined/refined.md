The provided content relates to CVE-2023-29626.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cid` parameter in the Yoga Class Registration system is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist: boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user information, and potentially gain full control of the server. The vulnerability allows the attacker to steal all information about the server, which could be awful for all users of this system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `cid` parameter in a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and inject malicious SQL code into the `cid` parameter. No authentication or special user privileges are mentioned to be required.
