### **[instantflorian](/instantflorian)** commented [Mar 17, 2023](#issuecomment-1473335180)

| Thanks for reporting. The vulnerability is only accessable if a malicious user has a) backend access and b) is allowed to install languages. Fixing the issue would mean to apply conceptional changes to the whloe language management; so actually it is in the responsibility of the site administrator to grant access only to trustworthy users and only the areas they really need (e.g. editing contents but not installing modules, languages etc.). Nevertheless we will take this into consideration for a later version. |
