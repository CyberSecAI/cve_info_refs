August 6, 2021Kudos to the dev for creating a genuinely useful app. After getting many spam calls call I just wanted to be able to receive calls from my contact list & other calls to go to voicemail . I was disappointed that this isn't available in the default phone app on my phone. Thankfully the dev of this app provided a solution. I paid for the premium version as I like to support the work of good developers. I gave 4 stars as there are some UI changes and additional features that could be added.25 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoApplika GmbHAugust 6, 2021Hi and thanks.

January 2, 2025Recently I user one app "Multi Call Blocker" which has a winderful option. There are four options for every contact "Allow, Silent, Ignore, Reject". I like very much the IGNORE option because, the person who calls us can hear ringing sound but there is no INCOMING CALL on our phone's screen. Will you introduce this feature, please?Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbIKOhO4OGDOtqoWloVD8DKPkQe2z-QmKEjq7PNmxnBzisyA=s32-rw-mo)NotMy RealName*more\_vert*

December 16, 2024No matter what notification settings I select in the app, they get ignored. If you are using an program or playing a game, this stupid app will interrupt you by putting a huge notification and ads on your screen whenever it blocks a call. The entire point of this app is to avoid the irritation of spam calls. All this app does is replace the irritation from the spam call, to its own beeps, ads, and interruptions. Terrible design.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoApplika GmbHFebruary 20, 2023Hi, you can disable this feature from the app settings. Just go to the settings tab, select "Notifications" and disable the "Pop-up banner for blocked calls" option. For more information contact us at support@call-blocker.info, we will be happy to help you. Thank youSee all reviews

Great app. Blocks every call unless the number is on our contacts list. We have it set to do that and love it. Does exactly what we want it to do.

I love that my phone never rings with nonsense calls. Blocks everyone that are not in my contacts. Works like a charm.

### Tiffany Bowman

Absolutely love this app. I was averaging 40-50 robo calls and scam calls a day. Not a single one has made it past the app. My contacts and whitelisted people have no problems reaching me at all. All apps should work this good.

### Jim Huffman

I can't believe how silent my phone has become. And when it does ring, I know it is someone I know from my phonebook. And if a call comes in that is not in my phonebook the incoming call goes to voicemail, allowing me to call them back if I wish to do so. Very nice App!

Works like a treat. Other call blockers I've used still let the calls ring through. Not this one. You can whitelist your whole contact list so only those calls will ring through, and it shows you the numbers that tried to call so you can whitelist or blacklist them. I highly recommend this app.

### Manuel Vazquez

I feel like I have my life back. I was getting as many as 17 calls a day about car warranties and Medicare. Now I get maybe 1 and its blocked. I love it.

### L Dukro

I have tried many call blockers and "Call Blocker" is hands down the best I've used. It just works. No more unwanted calls from Auto Warranty salespeople, (for cars I no longer own), insurance salespeople, nothing, nada, nyet. I don't even hear phone ring. Legitimate calls go to voicemail where a voice message can be recorded. Spammers don't leave messages, so they waste THEIR time, not mine. I'm gladly upgrading. Dev deserves it. Best ever! Thank you!
