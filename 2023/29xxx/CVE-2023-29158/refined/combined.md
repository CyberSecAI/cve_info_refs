### 3.4 RESEARCHER

SUBNET Solutions reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

SUBNET Solutions has fixed these issues by enabling a file integrity check on uploaded images and anti-forgery tokens to prevent replay attacks. The fix was introduced in PowerSYSTEM Center update 12 as well as Update 8+Hotfix (both identified by release number 5.12.2305.10101, which can be located in Settings à Overview à Version).

SUBNET Solutions recommends users to follow the following workarounds:

* Users should verify that SVG files do not contain HTML elements or scripts and validate that JPG and PNG files are not SVG files.
* Users should verify network security rules to ensure that outbound connections to the internet are not possible.
* If the above cannot be performed or notifications are not required, disable email notifications for reports from PowerSYSTEM Center.
* Monitor user activity and ensure application control rules only allow preauthorized executables to run.
* Deny users to run other executables on client access servers (PowerSYSTEM Center front end access point).

CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).
