| Review Checklist Hello reviewers! üëã Please follow this checklist when reviewing this Pull Request. General  * Ensure that the Pull Request has a descriptive title. * If this is a change that users need to know about, please apply the `release notes (needs details)` label so that merging is blocked unless the summary release notes document is included. * If a test is added or modified, there should be a documentation on top of the test to explain what the expected behavior is what the test does.  If a new flag is being introduced:  * Is it really necessary to add this flag? * Flag names should be clear and intuitive (as far as possible) * Help text should be descriptive. * Flag names should use dashes (`-`) as word separators rather than underscores (`_`).  If a workflow is added or modified:  * Each item in `Jobs` should be named in order to mark it as `required`. * If the workflow should be required, the maintainer team should be notified.  Bug fixes  * There should be at least one unit or end-to-end test. * The Pull Request description should include a link to an issue that describes the bug.  Non-trivial changes  * There should be some code comments as to why things are implemented the way they are.  New/Existing features  * Should be documented, either by modifying the existing documentation or creating new documentation. * New features should have a link to a feature request issue or an RFC that documents the use cases, corner cases and test cases.  Backward compatibility  * Protobuf changes should be wire-compatible. * Changes to `_vt` tables and RPCs need to be backward compatible. * `vtctl` command output order should be stable and `awk`-able. * RPC changes should be compatible with vitess-operator * If a flag is removed, then it should also be removed from VTop, if used there. |

I see that the error code here is the correct one - `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Why does the client display `Unknown`?

Do we convert all RPC errors to Unknown errors? It just seems misleading to be claiming that it is an `unknown rpc error` when it is not.

Or is this deliberate obfuscation?

it depends (NOT\_FOUND gets converted to 404, for example), but that's something we can address separately if you feel it's an issue

|  |  | ## Summary |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Shard name validation in TopoServer |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Prior to v16.0.2, it was possible to create a shard name with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Shard names may no longer contain the forward slash ("/") character, and TopoServer's `CreateShard` method returns an error if given such a name. |

# Release of Vitess v16.0.2

## Known Issues

### Schema-initialization stuck on semi-sync ACKs while upgrading to `v16.0.2`

During upgrades from `<= v15.x.x` to `v16.0.2`, as part of `PromoteReplica` call, the schema-init realizes that there are schema diffs to apply and ends up writing to the database if [semi-sync](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/features/mysql-replication/#semi-sync) is enabled, all of these writes get blocked indefinitely.

Eventually, `PromoteReplica` fails, and this fails the entire PRS call.

A fix for this issue was merged on `release-16.0` in [PR#13441](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13441), read the [corresponding bug report to learn more](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13426).

This issue is fixed in `v16.0.3` and later patch releases.

### Broken downgrade from v17.x.x when super\_read\_only turned on by default

In `v17.x.x` `super_read_only` is turned on by default meaning that downgrading from `v17` to `v16.0.2` breaks due to `init_db.sql` needing write access.

This issue is fixed in `>= v16.0.3` thanks to [PR #13525](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13525)

## Major Changes

### Upgrade to `go1.20.3`

Vitess `v16.0.2` now runs on `go1.20.3`.

Below is a summary of this Go patch release. You can learn more [here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20).

> go1.20.3 (released 2023-04-04) includes security fixes to the go/parser, html/template, mime/multipart, net/http, and net/textproto packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler, the linker, the runtime, and the time package. See the Go 1.20.3 milestone on our issue tracker for details.

### EffectiveCallerId in Vtgate gRPC calls

A new flag `grpc-use-static-authentication-callerid` is added to gate the behavior introduced in [#12050](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12050).

Earlier, we used to automatically set immediateCallerID to user from static authentication context that overrode the EffectiveCallerId.

### Shard name validation in TopoServer

Prior to v16.0.2, it was possible to create a shard name with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations.

Shard names may no longer contain the forward slash ("/") character, and TopoServer's `CreateShard` method returns an error if given such a name.

| Overview of the Issue TopoServer's `CreateShard` does only minimal validation on the shard name; if you create a shard with a "/" character (e.g. `commerce/a/b`), but *without* a "-" character, it is assumed to be non-range-based sharding and is therefore valid. other methods and commands will parse this as a keyspace with name `commerce` and a shard named `a/b`, which breaks those commands. Reproduction Steps  1. use vtadmin to create a shard named `commerce/a/b` 2. Load vtadmin, keyspace tab shows nothing (even if you had other keyspaces previously)  Binary Version ``` `main`, `v16`, probably every version prior ``` Operating System and Environment details ``` n/a ``` Log Fragments *No response* |

# VTAdmin users that can create shards can deny access to other functions

Moderate

[deepthi](/deepthi)
published
GHSA-pqj7-jx24-wj7w
May 11, 2023

## Package

gomod

vitessio/vitess
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<16.0.2

## Patched versions

v16.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error.

Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work.

Creating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly.

### Patches

v16.0.2

### Workarounds

* Always use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin
* Disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC
* Delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server. For example, if you created a shard called `a/b` in keyspace `commerce`, and you are running etcd, it can be deleted by doing something like

```
% etcdctl --endpoints "http://${ETCD_SERVER}" del /vitess/global/keyspaces/commerce/shards/a/b/Shard

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Vitess

Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL
through generalized sharding.

By encapsulating shard-routing logic, Vitess allows application code and
database queries to remain agnostic to the distribution of data onto
multiple shards. With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your needs
grow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.

Vitess has been a core component of YouTube's database infrastructure
since 2011, and has grown to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes.

For more about Vitess, please visit [vitess.io](https://vitess.io).

Vitess has a growing community. You can view the list of adopters
[here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

#### Reporting a Problem, Issue, or Bug

To report a problem, the best way to get attention is to create a GitHub issue using proper severity level based on this [guide](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/SEVERITY.md).

For topics that are better discussed live, please join the [Vitess Slack](https://vitess.io/slack) workspace.
You may post any questions on the #general channel or join some of the special-interest channels.

Follow [Vitess Blog](https://blog.vitess.io/) for low-frequency updates like new features and releases.

#### Security

##### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

To report a security vulnerability, please email vitess-maintainers.

See [Security](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/v0.16.2/SECURITY.md) for a full outline of the security process.

##### Security Audit

A third party security audit was performed by Cure53. You can see the full report [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/v0.16.2/doc/VIT-01-report.pdf).

## Documentation [¬∂](#section-documentation "Go to Documentation")

### Overview [¬∂](#pkg-overview "Go to Overview")

test.go is a "Go script" for running Vitess tests. It runs each test in its own
Docker container for hermeticity and (potentially) parallelism. If a test fails,
this script will save the output in \_test/ and continue with other tests.

Before using it, you should have Docker 1.5+ installed, and have your user in
the group that lets you run the docker command without sudo. The first time you
run against a given flavor, it may take some time for the corresponding
bootstrap image (vitess/bootstrap:<flavor>) to be downloaded.

It is meant to be run from the Vitess root, like so:

```
$ go run test.go [args]

```

For a list of options, run:

```
$ go run test.go --help

```
