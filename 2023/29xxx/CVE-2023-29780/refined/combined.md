These nightlights are great. They’re Matter enabled, plug-in and use Wi-Fi. If everything in your smart home could be that easy. I’m controlling mine with Home Assistant, though they also offer a phone app if you’re not into HA. Super easy to get them on my network and into larger automations. Have them in my downstairs and upstairs hallways with an automation tied to motion, when the ambient light is low, turning on all of the nightlights until 30 seconds after the motion stops. Excellent at night it’s enough light to get around without being obnoxious to other sleepers. Also put one in the bathroom above the sink as a motion nightlight that also triggers the hot water recirculation pump for two minutes.

They’ve been rock solid so far. Since there are no batteries, they should last forever. Forever…

Dethpidkle Smart Color Night Light

I was looking to automate my fireplace and because I didn’t have enough current in the switch for a smart switch, I needed a solution that powered itself. Install was simple, setup took a bit of work but it was my fault, on a different Wi-Fi network, but once I figured that out it was a breeze. Integrates with the Alexa platform seamlessly.

I have a star window that faces east. Every night we leave it open to get the cool air in, and in the early morning our 88-year-old grandma would climb the stairs to close the curtain; otherwise, the morning sun gets pretty hot quickly. Now with this electric blind, grandma can easily use the old-fashioned remote control to close the curtain, no need to climb stairs. Although the product supports voice or app control, the old-fashioned way is more friendly for the elderly. Upon arrival, the top right corner of the blind is squeezed by the battery pack! I think (picture it, it’s not a big issue since you can’t see much damage after installation feature). However, their customer service is very good; they said they will mail me a new package and I don’t need to return the current one. For installation, I did the inside mount, and I think their provided screw and plastic anchor may not be the best combination. For inside mount, the top of the window should be wood and drywall; the anchor is only for drywall, I don’t think you can put the anchor in all the way (blocked by wood). I used drywall screw (e.g., longer screw without anchor) and it’s super easy to install. The user manual should also include a picture of the finished inside mount e.g., you only need to install the two round metal holders, and then you click in the blind. The two 90-degree holders are not for inside mount.

I recently added the ThirdReality Zigbee Contact Sensor to my smart home setup, and it has been an impressive addition. Compatible with Samsung SmartThings, it effortlessly integrates into my existing smart ecosystem. One notable advantage of this sensor is its use of regular batteries instead of coin batteries, providing both convenience and cost-effectiveness. The sensor reliably detects contact and accurately triggers actions as expected.

Alex Door and Window Sensor

Although this is a Zigbee device, there was no specific Hubitat driver for this sensor. After some trial and error, the “Generic Zigbee Glass Break Sensor” driver works perfectly with this sensor. The sensor itself has an audible alarm that can be turned on/off through dip switches, and 4 levels of shock sensitivity that can be adjusted through a further 2 dip switches. It came with a double-stick adhesive which was perfect to mount it under my kitchen cabinet. Now when I bang on the counter, it turns the kitchen lights on. Great little sensor.
