Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `cmd/go` tool of the Go programming language. It stems from the improper sanitization of linker flags passed through the `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive. The `go` command fails to correctly identify non-optional flags, treating them as optional. This allows an attacker to inject malicious flags, leading to arbitrary code execution during the build process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `go` command does not properly sanitize linker flags provided via the `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive.
*   **Incorrect Flag Handling:** Non-optional flags are incorrectly considered optional, allowing the injection of disallowed flags.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code during the build process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Malicious modules could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability during build.
*   **Data Disclosure, Modification or DoS:** As noted by NetApp, successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Modules:** An attacker can create a malicious Go module with a crafted `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive.
*   **"go get" command:**  When a user executes `go get` on the malicious module, the vulnerability is triggered during the build.
*   **Any command building untrusted code:** Any command which builds untrusted code that contains a malicious `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive may be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject code into the build process via a malicious module or code.
*   **Unsuspecting Victim:** The victim needs to build the attacker-controlled code. This can occur either during the retrieval of a malicious module, or through the building of other untrusted code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Go versions prior to 1.19.10 and Go 1.20.x before 1.20.5.
*   Both the `gc` and `gccgo` compilers are affected.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by linker flags specified via a `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive.
*   The vulnerability is publicly discussed.

This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical), indicating a high risk.
