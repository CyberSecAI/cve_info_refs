Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29519:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code within the "Attachment Selector" gadget of XWiki. Specifically, the `property` field of the attachment selector is vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Eval Injection:** The application is vulnerable to "Eval Injection" (CWE-95) because it dynamically evaluates user-controlled input. The `propValue` is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in a context where it is interpreted as code.
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is exploitable using Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious code in the `property` field of an attachment selector.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A registered user can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious code into the `property` field of an attachment selector within their dashboard.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful RCE can lead to privilege escalation, potentially granting the attacker administrative access.
- **Complete User Compromise:** An attacker can perform any actions the user can, view information the user can view, and modify information the user can modify.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Attachment Selector Gadget:** The vulnerability exists within the "Attachment Selector" gadget used in the XWiki dashboard.
- **`property` field:** The malicious payload is injected into the `property` field of the attachment selector.
- **CSRF Chaining:** The exploit can be facilitated by chaining CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities on the logout and login endpoints to redirect a victim to the attacker's account and payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the XWiki platform.
- **Dashboard Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a dashboard where they can add and configure the vulnerable "Attachment Selector" gadget.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know to target the `property` field.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-ui`
- The vulnerability was found by Ren√© de Sain (@renniepak).
- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a gadget called 'test' to the dashboard which has the malicious payload injected in the configuration options.
- The fix implemented involves escaping the `${propValue}` when used in the hidden input field.

**Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is patched in XWiki versions 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.2, and 15.0-rc-1.

**Workaround:** The vulnerability can be worked around by applying the changes from this commit: [5e8725b](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5e8725b4272cd3e5be09d3ca84273be2da6869c1).
