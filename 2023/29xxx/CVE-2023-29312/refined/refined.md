- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read issues (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to memory leaks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requires no special privileges (PR:N), and requires user interaction (UI:R) in the form of a user opening a malicious file or document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs a way to get a malicious file to the victim and have the victim open the file with the vulnerable software.
