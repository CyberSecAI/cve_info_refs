Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of included page references within the "IncludedPagesDocumentInformation" panel. Specifically, when a page includes a reference with a code block (e.g. using the {{display reference=...}} macro) containing script code such as Groovy, Python or Velocity, this code is executed when rendering the "IncludedPagesDocumentInformation" panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Eval Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input (page references) that are dynamically evaluated by the system. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code:** The system fails to neutralize or sanitize the injected script code, which is then directly evaluated, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with simple edit rights on a document can achieve full access to the XWiki installation by injecting and executing arbitrary code.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python, or Velocity code on the server. This gives the attacker full control over the XWiki installation.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Due to the ability to execute arbitrary code, the attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete any data on the system, install backdoors, or compromise the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the XWiki web interface, specifically by editing a document with the wiki editor.
*   **Malicious Macro Injection:** The attacker injects malicious script code within a `display reference` macro when editing a document's content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Edit Rights:** The attacker needs to have edit rights to any document within the XWiki installation.
*   **Basic Knowledge of XWiki Macros:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `display reference` macro in combination with script macros such as `groovy`.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploit doesn't require any specific user interaction. The attacker only needs to save a document with the malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the "IncludedPagesDocumentInformation" panel of the XWiki platform.
*   The issue is present in versions 14.0-rc-1 and prior to the patched versions 14.4.7 and 14.10.
*   The fix involves improved escaping of included page references in the mentioned panel.
