- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `editor.md` project does not filter markdown text, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts through user-provided input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization or filtering of user-supplied markdown text.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the `editor.md` application, potentially leading to malicious actions such as stealing cookies, session hijacking or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through markdown text input. An attacker can inject malicious code within the markdown text, which will then be executed by the `editor.md` when rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to input markdown text into the editor.md application.
