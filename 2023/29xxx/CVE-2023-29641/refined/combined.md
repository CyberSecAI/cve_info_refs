### **[PoppingSnack](/PoppingSnack)** commented [Mar 21, 2023](#issue-1633711624)

| This project does not filter the markdown text, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. For example, if "《img src=1 onerror=alert(1)》" is entered during text editing, the malicious script in the text will be executed by editor.md. If a user directly uses editor.md and does not filter text, the user may be attacked.
