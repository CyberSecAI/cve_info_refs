```json
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because affected versions of Laminas Diactoros accept a single line feed (LF / `\\n`) character at the end of a header name. This leads to syntactically invalid HTTP messages when serialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of newline characters in HTTP header names."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker controlling header names can craft invalid HTTP messages, potentially leading to application errors, invalid HTTP requests sent out by PSR-18 clients, or denial of service if a remote service's WAF blocks malformed requests.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can control the header names passed to Laminas Diactoros, injecting a newline character at the end."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the header names that are passed to Laminas Diactoros."
  }
