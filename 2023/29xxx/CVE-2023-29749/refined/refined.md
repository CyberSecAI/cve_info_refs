- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Yandex Navigator application exposes components that allow unauthorized applications to modify the data in its SharedPreference files. These files are loaded into memory during application startup and influence the behavior of certain features.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Insecure Shared Preferences:** The application's SharedPreference files, particularly those with names starting with `ru.yandex.yandexnavi.`, are modifiable by other applications.
  - **Exposed Components:** The application exposes components like `ru.yandex.common.clid.ClidService` that can be used to manipulate these SharedPreference files.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can modify application settings and disable functionalities such as the search box in the notification bar. This impacts the application's normal operation and allows unauthorized modification of application behavior.
    - **Arbitrary data modification:** Attackers can insert arbitrary data into the SharedPreference files which might store important configuration or user-related data. This can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption or further exploits.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - **Inter-app communication:** An attacker crafts a malicious application that sends intents to the vulnerable component (`ru.yandex.common.clid.ClidService`) in the Yandex Navigator app.
  - **Intent manipulation:** The malicious app sets specific intent extras, including the `preferences` key specifying the target SharedPreference file and a `bundle` containing the data to be modified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the same device as the vulnerable Yandex Navigator application.
  - The malicious app needs to be able to craft intents to communicate with exported components of the Yandex Navigator app.
