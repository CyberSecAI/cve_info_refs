- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), and the user interaction is required (UI:R). No privileges are needed (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access and convince a user to open a crafted file/document.
