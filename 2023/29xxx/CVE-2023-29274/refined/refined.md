- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). This occurs when the software reads memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer, resulting in undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L). No privileges are required (PR:N), but user interaction is needed (UI:R). The scope is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to entice a user to open a specially crafted file, triggering the out-of-bounds read. No special privileges are required to do so.
