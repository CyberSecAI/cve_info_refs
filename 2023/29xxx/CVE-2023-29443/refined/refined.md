- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A threat actor with the SDAdmin role can configure a malicious server to return a response with a malformed XML using the Reports integration API. This allows for the injection of an XML External Entity (XXE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the Reports integration API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to potentially access system files.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves configuring a malicious server to return a malformed XML response through the Reports integration API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the SDAdmin role in the affected application.
