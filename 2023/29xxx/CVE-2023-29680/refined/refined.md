The content is related to CVE-2023-29680.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tenda N301v6 router stores the password used to authenticate to the device using a weak encoding method (base64). Additionally, the firmware does not support HTTPS, leaving credentials vulnerable during transmission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak password encoding: The router uses base64 encoding to store and transmit the password, which is easily decoded.
- Lack of HTTPS: The absence of HTTPS support results in cleartext transmission of the encoded password, susceptible to interception.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the base64 encoded password by eavesdropping on network traffic.
- By decoding the password, the attacker gains full access to the router's administrative interface.
- The attacker can then change the router's settings, including the password, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition by disrupting network access.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same LAN or WLAN network as the target router.
- The attacker performs ARP spoofing to intercept communications between the router and a user.
- The attacker captures the HTTP request containing the base64 encoded password within the cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform ARP spoofing to redirect traffic.
- The attacker needs to be able to capture and analyze network traffic, for example with Wireshark.
