Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `since` parameter of the `XWiki.Notifications.Code.LegacyNotificationAdministration` page. This allows an attacker to inject XWiki syntax through the `since` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XWiki Syntax Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the `since` parameter isn't properly sanitized, allowing the injection of arbitrary XWiki syntax.
- **Unescaped User Input:** The application fails to properly escape user-supplied input before rendering it, leading to the execution of injected code.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The injection vulnerability leads to privilege escalation, as a user with only view rights can execute arbitrary code with programming rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from view rights to programming rights.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With programming rights, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** This vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the application. Attackers can access sensitive data, modify data, or render the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious XWiki syntax into the `since` parameter of a specific URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only view rights to the vulnerable page.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable XWiki instance.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction beyond loading the specially crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially present in a template used by the distribution wizard before being moved to the `LegacyNotificationAdministration` page.
- The fix involves escaping the `since` parameter value before using it in the page.
- The fix is available in XWiki versions 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8 and 14.10.3.
- Workarounds are provided for older versions by modifying specific files to add the missing escaping.
