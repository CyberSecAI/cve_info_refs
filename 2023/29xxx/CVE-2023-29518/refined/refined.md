Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper escaping of user-controlled input within the `Invitation.InvitationCommon` page in XWiki. Specifically, the page was processing and displaying user-provided content without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is code injection. By crafting a specific URL and manipulating the `sheet` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Groovy, Python, or Velocity code.
*   **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping or sanitization of the input before rendering it within the context of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with only view rights can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Full Access to XWiki Installation:** Successful exploitation can grant an attacker full control over the XWiki installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes malicious code within the `sheet` parameter.
*   **Publicly Accessible Page:** The `Invitation.InvitationCommon` page is installed by default and is potentially accessible to all users, including guests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **View Rights:** The attacker needs only view rights on the XWiki instance to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki installation to submit the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by navigating to a URL like `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/%5D%5D%20%7B%7Basync%20async%3D%22true%22%20cached%3D%22false%22%20context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln(%22Hello%20%22%20%2B%20%22from%20groovy!%22)%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D?sheet=Invitation.InvitationCommon&xpage=view&test=1`.
*   The `Invitation.InvitationCommon` page contains a rights object that grants view rights to all users and guests which could expand the scope of impact.
*   The fix involves improved escaping within the `Invitation.InvitationCommon.xml` file.
* The vulnerability is identified as CWE-95.

**Additional Notes**

The provided information includes a GitHub Security Advisory which confirms the vulnerability, affected versions, patched versions, and workarounds, further supporting the analysis.

The patch for the vulnerability primarily focuses on adding proper XML escaping for the localization strings, as well as escaping the document link in an error message related to loading invitation configuration. This indicates that the root of the issue was the lack of proper escaping in these specific locations, which allowed the injected code to be executed.
