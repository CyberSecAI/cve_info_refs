Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input on the "My-Blog" page, specifically in the article editor and blog detail sections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  A reflected XSS vulnerability exists on the article editor page located at `<http://localhost:8080/article/editor/1>`.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A stored XSS vulnerability exists on the blog detail page located at `<http://localhost:8080/article/1>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. When a user views the affected pages, the malicious script will be executed within their browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and gaining access to the victim's account.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data visible to the user.
  - **Malicious actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user, like modifying data or sending unauthorized requests.
  - **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage visible to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the input fields of the "My-Blog" page, particularly the article editor and the blog detail sections.
  - The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into fields (likely title, content, etc) which are then rendered on the vulnerable pages.
  - **Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is included in the URL and reflected back to the user when they visit the article editor page.
  - **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is saved in the database and then executed when another user views the blog detail page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable input fields to inject malicious scripts. For stored XSS they need to be able to save data which is rendered on the vulnerable pages.
- No special access beyond a regular user is needed for exploiting the stored XSS and reflected XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes screenshots illustrating the vulnerabilities, further confirming their existence.
- The provided URLs of vulnerable pages seem to be local testing environment.
