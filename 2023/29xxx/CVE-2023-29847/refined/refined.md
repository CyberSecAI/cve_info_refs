The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in AeroCMS v0.0.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the comment section ("Author" and "Content" fields) before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize user input before storing and displaying it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users (including administrators) who view the comments.
- This can lead to attacks like phishing, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the "comment_author" and "comment_content" parameters when submitting a comment.
- The injected script is then stored in the database, and executed when a user views the comment either on the public-facing post page or the admin comments section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit comments to a post within the application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
