Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The "Purchase Order Management-1.0" application allows users to submit input into files or upload files to the server without proper sanitization. This leads to file inclusion vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **File Inclusion:** The application is vulnerable to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application's ability to include files based on user-controlled input allows attackers to read and execute files on the server (LFI) or from external locations (RFI).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by including malicious files. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Server Takeover:** By exploiting the file inclusion vulnerability, attackers can gain control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, website defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure**: Attackers could potentially read sensitive data by including arbitrary files on the server through LFI vulnerabilities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** Attackers can manipulate URL parameters to specify the file path that the application includes.
*  **File Uploads:** Users can upload files to the server and then use LFI to execute them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of how file inclusion vulnerabilities work and how to manipulate HTTP requests.
*   **No Privilege Required:** The provided documentation specifically mentions "Unprivilege user interaction" meaning an attacker does not need privileged access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided github link contains a README.MD file which includes proof-of-concept code showing how an attacker can use PHP to either read sensitive files, or to rename the application's root directory.
* The brightsec.com content provides detailed explanations and examples of LFI and RFI vulnerabilities in different programming languages, including PHP, JSP, and SSI which are consistent with the information found in the github repository.
*  The github content also refers to a blog post from nu11secur1ty which provides more information about this specific vulnerability, which is not available here.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the file inclusion vulnerabilities present in the "Purchase Order Management-1.0" application based on the given content.
