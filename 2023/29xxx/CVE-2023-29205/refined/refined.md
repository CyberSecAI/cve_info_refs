Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29205:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `HTML macro` in XWiki not properly sanitizing script-related HTML tags. This lack of systematic neutralization allows users to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be stored within the wiki and executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `HTML macro` does not adequately sanitize user-provided HTML, allowing for the injection of script-related tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can potentially steal user session tokens, leading to account compromise.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Data Theft:** JavaScript can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information accessible to the user.
*   **Defacement:**  Attackers could modify the content of the wiki pages they have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Macro:** The vulnerability is exploited through the use of the `HTML macro` within the XWiki platform.
*   **WYSIWYG Editor:** The attack can be launched via any field using the WYSIWYG editor by inserting the HTML macro and the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with permissions to edit content where the WYSIWYG editor is used
*  **Knowledge of XWiki Syntax**: Attackers need to know the XWiki syntax to insert the `HTML macro`.
*   **Ability to Edit Content:** Attackers need to be able to edit fields that use the WYSIWYG editor.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple areas of XWiki, including user profile pages, blog pages, annotations, source editor, and FAQ pages.
*   The vulnerability was present in XWiki versions before 14.8RC1.
*   The fix involves systematically cleaning up the HTML macro output when the user does not have script rights.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 10.0.
*   The attack complexity is low, and no user interaction is required, increasing the severity of the vulnerability.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-29205 is correctly associated with the identified vulnerability in the XWiki platform.
