# Multiple instances of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) via HTML and raw macro

Critical

Apr 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 14.8RC1

## Patched versions

14.8RC1

## Description

### Impact

The HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user profile page.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch involve that the HTML macro are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have script right.

### Workarounds

There's no workaround for this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

I have managed to trigger stored XSS in v13.2 of XWiki in default configuration. This appears to affect any field using the WYSIWYG editor. I originally found it in v11 but tested the newest version and it works there too. Any user (or guest depending on security settings) can store JavaScript within WYSIWYG fields that they have permission to edit.

To achieve stored XSS, one can:

1. Edit a field that uses the WYSIWYG editor
2. click the "source" button
3. Enter the HTML macro {{html}}
4. Enter HTML containing an XSS payload (see proof of concept below)
5. Close the HTML macro with {{/html}}
6. Click "Save and View"

Test proof-of concept:

{{html}}<img src=a onerror="javascript:prompt(1)"/>{{/html}}

This string displays a JavaScript prompt box with the number 1 in it, though could run malicious JavaScript inside the user's session in an attempt to perform actions as them or steal tokens.

When quickly checking, I could trigger this on

* User profile page - About and Address fields
* Blog page / blog summary
* Annotation (CTRL+M)
* The source editor for XWiki pages
* The FAQ page
* (There are no-doubt more that I didn't try)

Screenshot of executing payload attached. Let me know if you need more details or videos or if the above will suffice
