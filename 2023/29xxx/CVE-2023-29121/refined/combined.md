Advisory on vulnerabilities
Enel X Waybox Pro & Plus 3.0 charger

We  inform  you  that  Enel  X  Waybox  Pro  and  Plus  charger  (3.0  versions)1  firmware  version  before
2.1.1.0_JB3VU096A  contains  security  vulnerabilities.  These  vulnerabilities  do  not  pose  any  risk  to
personal data.

We have promptly fixed these vulnerabilities through a remote firmware update to avoid any potential
attacks.

No further actions are required by you or end users to address these issues. All the Waybox connected
to internet received this fix automatically. If the Waybox is not connected to internet, download Enel
X Way mobile App from your app store and follow the instructions.

This document provides you with a description of all identified vulnerabilities and explains which type
of information a malicious attacker could have gained access to before they were fixed. We are not
aware of any real malicious attacks on any installed charger.

1.  History

These security vulnerabilities were discovered by PCAutomotive (Abdellah Benotsmane, Anna Breeva,
Artem Ivachev, Danila Parnishchev) and were confirmed by Enel X Way. Enel X Way and PCAutomotive
have exchanged in a constructive manner on the identified vulnerabilities. According to our tests, an
attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities on an unpatched charger could gain access to information stored
on the charger, bypass charging restrictions set by the device owner, and cause denial of service on
the charger. No personal data would be accessible during a potential attack.

We have promptly released new firmware that resolves all the identified vulnerabilities and we are
updating remotely all affected connected chargers. No actions are required by you or the end users.
