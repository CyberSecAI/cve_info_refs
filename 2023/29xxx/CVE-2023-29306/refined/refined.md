- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low level of attacker complexity (AC:L) and no privileges (PR:N). It requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request that will be reflected by the application and executed in the victim's browser. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
