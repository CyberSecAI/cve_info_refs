  "CVE-2023-29623": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `password` parameter in the login form.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's response, which can then be executed in the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, capture passwords, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to malicious websites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `password` parameter and enticing a user to visit the malicious URL."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit the crafted URL, or the attacker can post the malicious data as part of a login request.",
       "technical_details": "The `password` parameter is directly reflected in the HTML response, without any sanitization. The provided exploit demonstrates a POST request to `Login.php` with a malicious payload in the `password` parameter. The payload includes an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute, which executes JavaScript code when the image fails to load."
