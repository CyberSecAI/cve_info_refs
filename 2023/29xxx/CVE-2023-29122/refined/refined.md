- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect file ownership of privileged service's libraries. Access to service libraries is granted to accounts that should not have access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect file permissions and/or ownership, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker may potentially gain escalated privileges. The advisory states that an attacker could gain access to information, bypass charging restrictions and cause a denial of service, however the specific impact of this vulnerability on its own is limited to gaining access to service libraries.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation would likely occur through a compromised account or process that is able to access the incorrectly owned service libraries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need a foothold on the system that allows interaction with the service libraries.
