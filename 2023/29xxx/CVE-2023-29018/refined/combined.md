# Cluster-level Privilege Escalation

Moderate

[beeme1mr](/beeme1mr)
published
GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83
Apr 12, 2023

## Package

OpenFeature Operator
(Kubernetes)

## Affected versions

< 0.2.32

## Patched versions

0.2.32

## Description

### Impact

On a node controlled by an attacker or malicious user, the lax permissions configured on `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` can be used to further escalate the privileges of any service account in the cluster.

The increased privileges could be used to modify cluster state, leading to DoS, or read sensitive data, including secrets.

### Patches

The patch mitigates this issue by restricting the resources the `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` can modify.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-29018

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
