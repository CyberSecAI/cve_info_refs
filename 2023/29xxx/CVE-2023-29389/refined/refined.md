Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability, which seems to be related to CAN bus injection attacks, and the specific context surrounding keyless car theft:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is the lack of proper authentication and authorization of messages on the CAN bus, specifically those related to the immobilizer system in vehicles. The CAN bus, designed as a "trusted network" for internal communication, lacks security measures like encryption or message signing. The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject CAN messages without proper authentication, allowing an attacker to impersonate legitimate ECUs and manipulate the vehicle's systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated CAN Messages:** The CAN bus messages related to the immobilizer system are not authenticated or encrypted, making them vulnerable to spoofing. ECUs simply trust messages without verification.
*   **Lack of Security Features:** The CAN bus is a "trusted network" with no security measures. This design assumes no malicious actors on the network.
*   **Dominant-Override:** Attackers use a modified CAN transceiver to override the bus, preventing legitimate ECUs from communicating or raising errors, ensuring successful injection of malicious messages
*   **Vulnerable CAN Bus Access Points:** Easy physical access to the CAN bus through easily accessible areas such as headlight connectors facilitates the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Vehicle Theft:** By injecting fake "key validated" messages, attackers can bypass the immobilizer system, unlock doors and start the car without the physical key, leading to vehicle theft.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate other vehicle systems by injecting specific CAN messages, potentially affecting functions beyond just the immobilizer and door locks.
*   **Bypass Security Measures:** The dominant-override mechanism is able to defeat basic CAN security hardware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** Attackers require physical access to the vehicle's CAN bus wiring, which is often easily accessible (e.g., through headlight connectors).
*   **CAN Injection:** The attack involves injecting malicious CAN messages onto the target vehicle's CAN bus.
*   **Modified CAN Transceiver:** The attack uses a specialized CAN transceiver that can override normal CAN communication behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Knowledge:**  Attackers need knowledge of CAN bus communication, vehicle electronics, and how to craft valid CAN messages to spoof legitimate ECUs.
*   **Hardware Access:**  Attackers need access to specific hardware, including modified CAN transceivers and a microcontroller for message injection.
*   **Physical Proximity to the Vehicle:** Attackers must have physical access to the vehicle to connect their CAN injection device.
*   **Ability to bypass physical access controls:** such as by removing the front bumper or headlight housing to access the CAN bus.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content highlights that this issue is not specific to Toyota vehicles but is a widespread problem across the automotive industry due to the lack of robust CAN bus security.
*   It was revealed that an attack device exists inside a common bluetooth speaker which allows for a low profile and stealthy attack, this further increases the chance of this attack being successful.
*   The content also details how some manufacturers are working on implementing cryptographic message signing for CAN messages as a possible solution, however, many factors are complicating the adoption.
