Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a missing authorization check on the `/user/save` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to create new user accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication and authorization on the `/user/save` endpoint. This means the endpoint can be accessed without any credentials and without checking for any permissions, making it possible to create unauthorized user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Creation:** Attackers can create arbitrary user accounts. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Gaining unauthorized access to the system and sensitive data.
  - Disrupting system functionality by adding large numbers of accounts.
  - Using the created accounts to perform other malicious actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/user/save` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the user details. This is a direct request, and no prior authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the application, specifically to the exposed `/user/save` endpoint.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided request example includes setting a number of headers (e.g., Content-Type, Origin, Referer), but these don't appear necessary for the exploit to work. The core issue is the lack of authentication checks.
- A user in a comment mentions the issue may not be fixed in version 4.9.3.
