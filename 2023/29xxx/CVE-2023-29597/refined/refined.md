Based on the provided content, the following vulnerability information can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection in bloofox CMS version 0.5.2. Specifically, the `eid` parameter in the `/admin/index.php?mode=content&page=pages&action=edit&eid=1` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `eid` parameter.
- Lack of input sanitization or validation on the `eid` parameter. While other `_POST` data is filtered using `validate_text()`, the `eid` parameter does not have this protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information.
    - Data modification: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Complete compromise of the application and its underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `eid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker likely needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel. However, the specific authentication requirements are not detailed in the provided content.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes images of the vulnerable code and SQLMap results, further confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The suggested protection is to add the `validate_text()` filter to the `eid` parameter.
