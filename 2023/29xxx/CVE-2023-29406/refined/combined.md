Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.20.6 and 1.19.11, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: insufficient sanitization of Host header

  The HTTP/1 client did not fully validate the contents of the Host header. A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional headers or entire requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

  Includes security fixes for CVE-2023-29406 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/60374>

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.6>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.20.6` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Cherry and Joedian for the Go team

## Description

![@neild](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52544?u=41bff20219d93918578944360c3930f30df4693b&v=4&size=48)[neild](https://github.com/neild)opened [on May 23, 2023](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/60374#issue-1722591815)

The `net/http` client does not sufficiently sanitize or check the validity of the `Request.Host` field. A maliciously-crafted `Host` field can inject request headers or entire new requests into the sent request. For example, setting `Request.Host` to `"hostname\r\nX-Header: oops"` adds an `X-Header: oops` header to the request.

Whether this is a vulnerability or just a bug depends on whether the `Request.Host` field is expected to be secured against untrusted inputs. We don't document this one way or the other. Exploiting this in practice seems difficult, since it requires requests to be sent using an unsanitized and untrusted `Request.Host` value, so if this is a vulnerability it seems reasonable to treat it as PUBLIC track. Either way, we should fix it.

This is a continuation of [#11206](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11206), which reports the same issue but had an incomplete fix.

Thanks to [@bartekn](https://github.com/bartekn) for reporting this issue.
