# Update in Cybersecurity Guidebook of BIS on Permission Settings for Network Share

BOSCH-SA-988400-BT

## Advisory Information

* **Advisory ID:**  BOSCH-SA-988400-BT
* **CVE Numbers and CVSS v3.1 Scores:**
  + [CVE-2023-29241](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29241)
    - Base Score:  [8.1 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
* **Published:**  28 Jun 2023
* **Last Updated:**  28 Jun 2023

## Summary

In a recent survey of BIS installations worldwide Bosch identified that for some installations the security settings may not meet our recommended security standards. For this reason, we have updated our "Cybersecurity Guidebook".

Section 4.5 of the Cybersecurity Guidebook describes how to configure access permissions for a shared folder of the BIS installation. In an older version of the Cybersecurity Guidebook, one of the recommended access permissions is wrongly stated as "Network" group instead of "Network Service" group. This information is updated in the new version of the documentation, because executing the earlier instructions may unintentionally grant access permission to potentially unauthorized users.

This is not a software bug, just an update of the documentation targeted at installers. This document is included in BIS installation folder since version BIS 5.0. Previous BIS version do not contain the document, but validating the security setting is generally advised.

## Affected Products

* Bosch BIS
  + CVE-2023-29241
    - Version(s): 5.0

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

For BIS 5.0 please apply patch BIS\_5\_0\_21100\_0\_Patch1.zip. Follow the instructions in the Readme of the patch. The patch will install an updated Cybersecurity Guidebook in folder "Platform" under the installation folder. Then follow the configuration steps in section 4.5 as described.

For any previous BIS version we recommend to double-check the security settings. Please follow the mitigation section below.

### Mitigation

Installation of BIS automatically creates the "MgtS" shared folder, which is accessible to the "Everyone" group. It is recommended to restrict the access and provide the following users and groups with full access to the "\MgtS" shared folder:

* MgtS-Service user
* IIS-USR user
* System group
* Network Service group
* Administrators group
* BIS Users group (add all users of BIS to the group)

Double-check that the "Network" group is not part of the access groups. Following that, proceed to remove the access for "Everyone" group.
