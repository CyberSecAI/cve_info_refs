- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache Kylin Server Config web interface displays the content of the `kylin.properties` file, which may contain sensitive server-side credentials. When the Kylin service runs over HTTP, network sniffers can intercept the HTTP payload and access this file content.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Exposure of sensitive information: The `kylin.properties` file, potentially containing credentials, is displayed in the web interface without proper protection.
    - Lack of transport layer security: Running the service over HTTP exposes the network payload to eavesdropping.
    - Insufficient credential handling: Credentials may be stored in plain text within `kylin.properties`.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can obtain server-side credentials by sniffing the network traffic, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the Apache Kylin service and its data.

- **Attack vectors:** Network sniffing via an insecure protocol (HTTP) when accessing the Server Config web interface.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic between a client and the Kylin server when the Server Config web interface is accessed over an insecure protocol like HTTP.
