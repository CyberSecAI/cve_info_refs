- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unquoted search path or element in some Intel® Arc™ Control software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software uses an unquoted search path or element, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to escalation of privilege, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), and the attack complexity is high (AC:H).
