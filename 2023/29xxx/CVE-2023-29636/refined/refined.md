Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the reported vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it on the web page. Specifically, the blog article content and blog titles are vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the blog content or title. This code can then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages. This could result in:
   - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Potentially gaining access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are:
   1.  The blog article details page, where malicious JavaScript can be injected via the article content editing page.
    2. The blog management page, specifically the blog title column, where malicious Javascript can be injected via the blog title.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to submit content (e.g., as a blog post author or through some other method) to inject malicious code into the vulnerable fields. No particular privilege or access to the backend would be needed beyond the ability to input potentially malicious strings into the vulnerable fields.
