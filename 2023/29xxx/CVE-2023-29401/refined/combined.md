### **[motoyasu-saburi](/motoyasu-saburi)** commented [Apr 1, 2023](#issue-1650264355)

| I have contacted the maintainer 4-5 times via email, Snyk, etc., but have not received a reply, so I am raising an Issue. Description `gin` > `context.go` > `func FileAttachment` contains a vulnerability that allows the extension/file name to be tampered with when downloading files.  This is known as a Reflect File Download attack. <https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Hafif-Reflected-File-Download-A-New-Web-Attack-Vector.pdf>  This vulnerability allows a Threat Actor to replace what was `.txt` when uploading with `.sh`, etc. when (victim) downloading.  This is due to improper handling of the filename in the Content-Disposition response header. <https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/a889c58de78711cb9b53de6cfcc9272c8518c729/context.go#LL1059-L1059C86>  My calculations CVSS (v3):   * CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H * Score: 7.5   However, I think the impact of the actual situation is much lower than that of CVSS. How to reproduceEnv OS: macOSVentura(13.1) Go ver: 1.18.2 darwin/arm64 gin ver: v1.9.0 (The latest ver has not been corrected either, so the problem probably remains.) Browser: Chrome 111.0.5563.110 (arm64)  (Linux or MacOS is required. This is because Windows does not allow file names containing " (double-quote) .)   ---  1. Create File  ``` $ touch 'malicious.sh";dummy=.txt'  ```  2. Setup gin project  ``` $ mkdir myproject $ go mod init tidy $ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin  ```  3. Generate Vuln code  ``` $ vi main.go  ```  Edit Directory  ``` package main  import (   "github.com/gin-gonic/gin" )  func main() {   r := gin.Default()   r.GET("/download", func(c *gin.Context) {     dir := "/Users/{CHANGE_PROJECT_DIRECTRY}/"      // Although the file name is hard-coded, we assume that the file name is actually determined by the DB or user input.     filename := "malicious.sh\";dummy=.txt"     c.FileAttachment(dir + filename, filename)   })   r.Run() }   ```  4. Build & Run & Access  ``` $ go build ./main.go $ ./main  ```  Access: `http://localhost:8080/download`   ---   Return Response Header:  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="malicious.sh";dummy=.txt" Last-Modified: Tue, 19 Jul 2022 08:53:26 GMT Date: Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:17:43 GMT  Content-Disposition:  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="malicious.sh";dummy=.txt"  Download File: `malicious.sh` Cause & Fix The reason is that the filename in Content-Disposition is not escape / encoded.  If not escape / encoded ( `"` ), the filename field can be terminated arbitrarily, as shown in the PoC.  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="malicious.sh";dummy=.txt"  Therefore, the following escapes are required.   * `"` --> `\"` or `%22` * `\r` --> `\\r` or `%0D` * `\n` --> `\\n` or `%0A`   ( `\r`, `\n` was converted to space, so no problem.)  The requirements for encoding `filename` in `Content-Disposition` are described in RFC6266 and WhatWG html spec(multipart/form-data).  RFC 6266 (section 5) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266#section-5>  [Appendix D](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6266#appendix-D). Advice on Generating Content-Disposition Header Fields ... o Avoid including the percent character followed by two hexadecimal characters (e.g., %A9) in the filename parameter, since some existing implementations consider it to be an escape character, while others will pass it through unchanged. ... Avoid including the "" character in the quoted-string form of the filename parameter, as escaping is not implemented by some user agents, and "" can be considered an illegal path character.  What WG - html spec - multipart/form-data <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#multipart-form-data>  For field names and filenames for file fields, the result of the encoding in the previous bullet point must be escaped by replacing any 0x0A (LF) bytes with the byte sequence `%0A`, 0x0D (CR) with `%0D` and 0x22 (") with `%22`. The user agent must not perform any other escapes.  Golang also implements Content-Disposition escaping based on these requirements. (This implementation is a `Content-Disposition` implementation for `multipart/form-data`, so the situation is slightly different from the `HTTP Response` > `Content-Disposition` in this issue.) <https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e0e0c8fe9881bbbfe689ad94ca5dddbb252e4233/src/mime/multipart/writer.go#L144>   ---  Reference RFC 6266 (section 5) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266#section-5>  What WG - html spec > multipart/form-data : <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#multipart-form-data>  OWASP ASVS (Related issue): [OWASP/ASVS#1390](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues/1390)  Golang impliments: <https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e0e0c8fe9881bbbfe689ad94ca5dddbb252e4233/src/mime/multipart/writer.go#L144>  Spring (Java) Impliments: <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/4f8516e2c3ca420b1608840ab901bf9df7e4d5f1/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/http/ContentDisposition.java#L594-L617>  Symfony(PHP) Impliments: <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/123b1651c4a7e219ba59074441badfac65525efe/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/HeaderUtils.php#L187-L189>  This is my own article, but it summarizes the impact, etc. on this issue. <https://gist.github.com/motoyasu-saburi/1b19ef18e96776fe90ba1b9f910fa714> |

| Thank you so much [@thinkerou](https://github.com/thinkerou) .  If possible, I would appreciate it if you could enable the GitHub feature "Private vulnerability reporting,".  There are people ([@igibek](https://github.com/igibek)) in this Issue who, like me, are looking for a place to report vulnerabilities. [#3563](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/3563) |

Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API with much better performance -- up to 40 times faster. If you need smashing performance, get yourself some Gin.

Gin is a web framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).
If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.

**Gin's key features are:**

* Zero allocation router
* Speed
* Middleware support
* Crash-free
* JSON validation
* Route grouping
* Error management
* Built-in rendering
* Extensible

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Gin requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.22](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.0) or above.

### Getting Gin

With [Go's module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
```

Alternatively, use `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

### Running Gin

A basic example:

```
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
  r := gin.Default()
  r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
      "message": "pong",
    })
  })
  r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080 (for windows "localhost:8080")
}
```

To run the code, use the `go run` command, like:

```
$ go run example.go
```

Then visit [`0.0.0.0:8080/ping`](http://0.0.0.0:8080/ping) in your browser to see the response!

### See more examples

#### Quick Start

Learn and practice with the [Gin Quick Start](/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/docs/doc.md), which includes API examples and builds tag.

#### Examples

A number of ready-to-run examples demonstrating various use cases of Gin are available in the [Gin examples](https://github.com/gin-gonic/examples) repository.

## Documentation

See the [API documentation on go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

The documentation is also available on [gin-gonic.com](https://gin-gonic.com) in several languages:

* [English](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/)
* [简体中文](https://gin-gonic.com/zh-cn/docs/)
* [繁體中文](https://gin-gonic.com/zh-tw/docs/)

This can fix this specific situation (that enables RFD attack) but what about using [filePath#Clean](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Clean)?

I tried using that method,

but the `"` was not escaped (or URL Encoded), so The vulnerability was not fixed.

But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

Perhaps you are confusing the file name with the file path.

There may be some misunderstandings, so I will add to this.

---

The first thing to escape is the `filename`. Not `filepath`.

The second thing, The Filename escape requirements are then as follows

* `"` --> `%2F`, `\"`
* `\r` --> `%0D`, `\\r`
* `\n` --> `%0A`, `\\n`

The third thing,

This line is the process of "escaping the 'file name at download time' on the HTTP Response Header.

In other words, filepath is irrelevant.

(The part that actually reads the file is the following line (`filepath`) )

<https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556/files#diff-552f47512a00afe5fc6850cc9ddc830a6daeca162750e50aab4ed549685e0253R1063>

---

> But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

This is answered by the third matter mentioned above.

This tells the Request side to "download the file with this kind of file name".

It is not the file path to be read by the Server side.

Does this answer your question?

| Is there a reason we can't use `url.QueryEscape` here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  For my own implementation I had copied the implementation from Go http/multipart, so:  ``` var quoteEscaper = strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"")  func escapeQuotes(s string) string { 	return quoteEscaper.Replace(s) }  h.Set("Content-Disposition", fmt.Sprintf(`form-data; name="%s"; filename="%s"`, escapeQuotes(fieldname), escapeQuotes(filename))) ``` |

| [@jerbob92](https://github.com/jerbob92)  Is there a reason we can't use url.QueryEscape here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  Both will solve the security issue. First, the requirement for encoding by URL Encode is Whtat's WG > multipart/form-data requirements.  In this case, the requirement to "perform URL Encoding" is not (strictly) the same as that of What's WG, since this is a response.  On the other hand, there is no clear escape requirement specified in the RFC 6266 either. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6266#section-5>  After that, we checked about 80 systems of several services, WebFrameworks, Browsers, etc., and found that most of them use BackSlash encoding for response headers, so we chose BackSlash style escaping and implemented it this time.  (For example, Gmail file downloads would have been in backslash format.)  In my personal opinion, either is honestly fine, since the root cause is that the Content-Disposition specification is not strict. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tested some different things and couldn't get around this fix, so for the least invasive change, I would indeed go for the string replacer version, and not the `url.QueryEscape`. I would go with the `escapeQuotes` method from `http/multipart` just so that the logic is matched. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tried the escape trick too, but it didn't work, Chrome just transformed it into an underscore, so filename becomes `tampering_field.sh_`, so that's why I didn't see it as a real problem. But I think the current fix is the best solution. |

| [@appleboy](https://github.com/appleboy) is there anything we can do to help move this forward? It has been almost 2 months with this vulnerability and no fix, people get anxious, feeling unprotected. A suggestion from me would be that if you cannot do the review and merge, could you possibly delegate it to [@thinkerou](https://github.com/thinkerou)? Many thanks! |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2023-1737

* CVE-2023-29401, GHSA-2c4m-59x9-fr2g
* Affects:
  github.com/gin-gonic/gin
* Published: May 11, 2023
* Modified: May 20, 2024

The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent as a file named "setup.bat".
If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.

[CVE-2023-29401] CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check

## Description

The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent as a file named "setup.bat". If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.

This can fix this specific situation (that enables RFD attack) but what about using [filePath#Clean](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Clean)?

I tried using that method,

but the `"` was not escaped (or URL Encoded), so The vulnerability was not fixed.

But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

[@fabricioereche](https://github.com/fabricioereche)

Perhaps you are confusing the file name with the file path.

There may be some misunderstandings, so I will add to this.

---

The first thing to escape is the `filename`. Not `filepath`.

The second thing, The Filename escape requirements are then as follows

* `"` --> `%2F`, `\"`
* `\r` --> `%0D`, `\\r`
* `\n` --> `%0A`, `\\n`

The third thing,

This line is the process of "escaping the 'file name at download time' on the HTTP Response Header.

In other words, filepath is irrelevant.

(The part that actually reads the file is the following line (`filepath`) )

<https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556/files#diff-552f47512a00afe5fc6850cc9ddc830a6daeca162750e50aab4ed549685e0253R1063>

---

> But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

This is answered by the third matter mentioned above.

This tells the Request side to "download the file with this kind of file name".

It is not the file path to be read by the Server side.

Does this answer your question?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is there a reason we can't use `url.QueryEscape` here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  For my own implementation I had copied the implementation from Go http/multipart, so:  ``` var quoteEscaper = strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"")  func escapeQuotes(s string) string { 	return quoteEscaper.Replace(s) }  h.Set("Content-Disposition", fmt.Sprintf(`form-data; name="%s"; filename="%s"`, escapeQuotes(fieldname), escapeQuotes(filename))) ``` |

First, the requirement for encoding by URL Encode is Whtat's WG > multipart/form-data requirements.  In this case, the requirement to "perform URL Encoding" is not (strictly) the same as that of What's WG, since this is a response.  On the other hand, there is no clear escape requirement specified in the RFC 6266 either. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6266#section-5>  After that, we checked about 80 systems of several services, WebFrameworks, Browsers, etc., and found that most of them use BackSlash encoding for response headers, so we chose BackSlash style escaping and implemented it this time.  (For example, Gmail file downloads would have been in backslash format.)  In my personal opinion, either is honestly fine, since the root cause is that the Content-Disposition specification is not strict. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tested some different things and couldn't get around this fix, so for the least invasive change, I would indeed go for the string replacer version, and not the `url.QueryEscape`. I would go with the `escapeQuotes` method from `http/multipart` just so that the logic is matched. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tried the escape trick too, but it didn't work, Chrome just transformed it into an underscore, so filename becomes `tampering_field.sh_`, so that's why I didn't see it as a real problem. But I think the current fix is the best solution. |

| [@appleboy](https://github.com/appleboy) is there anything we can do to help move this forward? It has been almost 2 months with this vulnerability and no fix, people get anxious, feeling unprotected. A suggestion from me would be that if you cannot do the review and merge, could you possibly delegate it to [@thinkerou](https://github.com/thinkerou)? Many thanks! |

## Gin Web Framework does not properly sanitize filename parameter of Context.FileAttachment function

Moderate severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-2c4m-59x9-fr2g)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-2c4m-59x9-fr2g/dependabot)

## Package

gomod

github.com/gin-gonic/gin
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 1.3.1-0.20190301021747-ccb9e902956d, < 1.9.1

## Patched versions

1.9.1

## Description

The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of "setup.bat";x=.txt" will be sent as a file named "setup.bat".

If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

I tried using that method,

but the `"` was not escaped (or URL Encoded), so The vulnerability was not fixed.

But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

[@fabricioereche](https://github.com/fabricioereche)

Perhaps you are confusing the file name with the file path.

There may be some misunderstandings, so I will add to this.

---

The first thing to escape is the `filename`. Not `filepath`.

The second thing, The Filename escape requirements are then as follows

* `"` --> `%2F`, `\"`
* `\r` --> `%0D`, `\\r`
* `\n` --> `%0A`, `\\n`

The third thing,

This line is the process of "escaping the 'file name at download time' on the HTTP Response Header.

In other words, filepath is irrelevant.

(The part that actually reads the file is the following line (`filepath`) )

<https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556/files#diff-552f47512a00afe5fc6850cc9ddc830a6daeca162750e50aab4ed549685e0253R1063>

---

> But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

This is answered by the third matter mentioned above.

This tells the Request side to "download the file with this kind of file name".

It is not the file path to be read by the Server side.

Does this answer your question?

| Is there a reason we can't use `url.QueryEscape` here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  For my own implementation I had copied the implementation from Go http/multipart, so:  ``` var quoteEscaper = strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"")  func escapeQuotes(s string) string { 	return quoteEscaper.Replace(s) }  h.Set("Content-Disposition", fmt.Sprintf(`form-data; name="%s"; filename="%s"`, escapeQuotes(fieldname), escapeQuotes(filename))) ``` |

| [@jerbob92](https://github.com/jerbob92)  Is there a reason we can't use url.QueryEscape here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  Both will solve the security issue. First, the requirement for encoding by URL Encode is Whtat's WG > multipart/form-data requirements.  In this case, the requirement to "perform URL Encoding" is not (strictly) the same as that of What's WG, since this is a response.  On the other hand, there is no clear escape requirement specified in the RFC 6266 either. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6266#section-5>  After that, we checked about 80 systems of several services, WebFrameworks, Browsers, etc., and found that most of them use BackSlash encoding for response headers, so we chose BackSlash style escaping and implemented it this time.  (For example, Gmail file downloads would have been in backslash format.)  In my personal opinion, either is honestly fine, since the root cause is that the Content-Disposition specification is not strict. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tested some different things and couldn't get around this fix, so for the least invasive change, I would indeed go for the string replacer version, and not the `url.QueryEscape`. I would go with the `escapeQuotes` method from `http/multipart` just so that the logic is matched. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tried the escape trick too, but it didn't work, Chrome just transformed it into an underscore, so filename becomes `tampering_field.sh_`, so that's why I didn't see it as a real problem. But I think the current fix is the best solution. |

| [@appleboy](https://github.com/appleboy) is there anything we can do to help move this forward? It has been almost 2 months with this vulnerability and no fix, people get anxious, feeling unprotected. A suggestion from me would be that if you cannot do the review and merge, could you possibly delegate it to [@thinkerou](https://github.com/thinkerou)? Many thanks! |

# Empower software innovation, securely

We provide software supply chain management for enterprises.

## Open source is here to stay

Software development is evolving. 90% of modern applications use open source code for good reason—speed. But when open source components go unmaintained, they become liabilities that leave organizations open to security and licensing risks. Software supply chain attacks are up 742% per year over the past 3 years and enterprises need a way to protect themselves without slowing innovation.

> That’s why we invented software supply chain management.

## We empower fearless development

> We’ve invested in knowing more about the quality of open source than anyone else in the world.

### What we do

The Sonatype platform empowers speed and security in open source development. It gives organizations total control of their SDLC for more confidence in every piece of open source code, source code, and containerized code.

2000

enterprise customers served

### Who we help

We unite software developers, application security professionals, operators, engineering leaders, and legal teams to manage their open source components safely so that they can focus on innovation.

15 million

software developers served

### How we do it

Our intelligence engine combines machine learning and nearly 100 in-house expert data researchers to create faster, more in-depth and accurate information about open source than available anywhere else.

This can fix this specific situation (that enables RFD attack) but what about using [filePath#Clean](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Clean)?

I tried using that method,

but the `"` was not escaped (or URL Encoded), so The vulnerability was not fixed.

But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

[@fabricioereche](https://github.com/fabricioereche)

Perhaps you are confusing the file name with the file path.

There may be some misunderstandings, so I will add to this.

---

The first thing to escape is the `filename`. Not `filepath`.

The second thing, The Filename escape requirements are then as follows

* `"` --> `%2F`, `\"`
* `\r` --> `%0D`, `\\r`
* `\n` --> `%0A`, `\\n`

The third thing,

This line is the process of "escaping the 'file name at download time' on the HTTP Response Header.

In other words, filepath is irrelevant.

(The part that actually reads the file is the following line (`filepath`) )

<https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556/files#diff-552f47512a00afe5fc6850cc9ddc830a6daeca162750e50aab4ed549685e0253R1063>

---

> But since it's for file reading those quotes will be needed? File params would be readable with or without it, isn't?

This is answered by the third matter mentioned above.

This tells the Request side to "download the file with this kind of file name".

It is not the file path to be read by the Server side.

Does this answer your question?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is there a reason we can't use `url.QueryEscape` here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  For my own implementation I had copied the implementation from Go http/multipart, so:  ``` var quoteEscaper = strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"")  func escapeQuotes(s string) string { 	return quoteEscaper.Replace(s) }  h.Set("Content-Disposition", fmt.Sprintf(`form-data; name="%s"; filename="%s"`, escapeQuotes(fieldname), escapeQuotes(filename))) ``` |

| [@jerbob92](https://github.com/jerbob92)  Is there a reason we can't use url.QueryEscape here? Just like in the UTF-8 version?  Both will solve the security issue. First, the requirement for encoding by URL Encode is Whtat's WG > multipart/form-data requirements.  In this case, the requirement to "perform URL Encoding" is not (strictly) the same as that of What's WG, since this is a response.  On the other hand, there is no clear escape requirement specified in the RFC 6266 either. <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6266#section-5>  After that, we checked about 80 systems of several services, WebFrameworks, Browsers, etc., and found that most of them use BackSlash encoding for response headers, so we chose BackSlash style escaping and implemented it this time.  (For example, Gmail file downloads would have been in backslash format.)  In my personal opinion, either is honestly fine, since the root cause is that the Content-Disposition specification is not strict. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tested some different things and couldn't get around this fix, so for the least invasive change, I would indeed go for the string replacer version, and not the `url.QueryEscape`. I would go with the `escapeQuotes` method from `http/multipart` just so that the logic is matched. |

| [@motoyasu-saburi](https://github.com/motoyasu-saburi) I tried the escape trick too, but it didn't work, Chrome just transformed it into an underscore, so filename becomes `tampering_field.sh_`, so that's why I didn't see it as a real problem. But I think the current fix is the best solution. |

| [@appleboy](https://github.com/appleboy) is there anything we can do to help move this forward? It has been almost 2 months with this vulnerability and no fix, people get anxious, feeling unprotected. A suggestion from me would be that if you cannot do the review and merge, could you possibly delegate it to [@thinkerou](https://github.com/thinkerou)? Many thanks! |
