Adobe Acrobat Reader versions 23.003.20244 (and earlier) and 20.005.30467 (and earlier) are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that could lead to Application denial-of-service. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability if the default PowerShell Set-ExecutionPolicy is set to Unrestricted, making the attack complexity high. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.
