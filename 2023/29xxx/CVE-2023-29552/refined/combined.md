# slpscan - service location protocol scanner

## intro

This is a research tool, created for looking deeper into SLP at the internet.
Due current events we decided to publish a version of it, to support defenders and researchers tackle the current ESXi exploitation scheme.

## usage

Show all supported functions

```
./slpscan.py -m ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SLPv1 Modes                    Operation       Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Show supported probes

```
./slpscan.py -P?

SLP Request               | Brief                              | Devices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
svc_type_req_holder_v1    | example pkt, svc_type_req_v1       |
svc_attr_req_holder_v1    | example request, svc_attr_req_v1   |
svc_req_holder_v2         | example pkt, svc_req_v2            |
svc_type_req_holder_v2    | example pkt, svc_type_req_v2       |
svc_attr_req_holder_v2    | example pkt, svc_attr_req_v2       |
VMWARE_SVC_Request_https  | service:https                      |

```

For SLP identification against ESXi Hosts use the probe published within the release:

```
./slpscan.py -l <ip> -P VMWARE_SVC_Request_https

```

If you have a datacenter and need to check a big list of hosts use the -L option.

If you have a specific probe you can easily add it to the probe json file in the libs directory. There are already several examples to do so.

General help:

```

                     [-P PROBE_MODE] [-d PKT_DELAY] [-T TIMEOUT] [-o OUTFILE] [-oj OUTFILE_JSON]

The ESXi team has investigated these vulnerabilities and determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed by performing the steps detailed in the resolution section of this article. This workaround is meant to be a temporary solution only and customers are advised to deploy the patches documented in the aforementioned VMSAs.

**Warning**:

This workaround is applicable ONLY to ESXi. Do not apply this workaround to other VMware products.

**Functionality Impacts:**

With the workaround, CIM clients which uses SLP to find CIM servers over port #427 will not be able to locate the service.

There is no requirement to reboot the ESXi host to disable/enable the service

#### Resolution

To implement the workaround perform the following steps:

       1 Login to the ESXi hosts using an SSH session (such as putty)

2 Stop the SLP service on the ESXi host with this command:

/etc/init.d/slpd stop

**Note**: The SLP service can only be stopped when the service is not in use. Use the following command to view the operational state of Service Location Protocol Daemon:

esxcli system slp stats get

3 Run the following command to disable the SLP service:

esxcli network firewall ruleset set -r CIMSLP -e 0

To make this change persist across reboots:

chkconfig slpd off

To check if the change is applied across reboots:

chkconfig --list | grep slpd

*output: slpd off*

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512273899654)

To remove the workaround perform the following steps:

1. Run the following command to enable the ruleset of SLP service:

esxcli network firewall ruleset set -r CIMSLP -e 1

2. Run the following command to change the current startup information of slpd service:

chkconfig slpd on

Run the following command to check if the change is applied after running the above step (Step 2#):

chkconfig --list | grep slpd

*output:*slpd on

3. Run the following command to start the SLP service:

/etc/init.d/slpd start

4. Disable and enable the CIM agent, see [How to disable or enable the CIM agent on the ESX/ESXi host](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/313877)

Later versions of ESXi report the SLPD service in the vCenter GUI

        1. To check if you can update the SLP service via the vSphere client, login to the vCenter

        2 Select the ESXi host and click on "Configure"  -- "Services". Look for SLP in the list
            If SLP is not listed, then use the process detailed above

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512276587924)

        3 Select SLPD and click on "Stop" and then click "Ok"

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512273460105)
           4 Select " Edit Startup Policy" and select "Start and stop manually". Click Ok

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512276788978)

             5 Reverse the steps above to re-enable the service

# SLPLOAD

Testtool for amplification factor of slpd daemon.

## Usage

### Show all modes

With the -m? option you can list all supported modes.

```
./slpload.py -m?
Supported modes:

        one-shot - load one-time data into svc
        load-test - try to load as much data as possible to service and calc ampfactor
        check - check data in default registry

```

### Test the maximum size of remote slpd buffer

Load test until remote buffer is filled. The command sets the buffer fillup to 1250bytes, registered lifetime to 10000 seconds and a timeout of 2s.

./slpload.py -T 10000 -s 1250 -t 2 -l 192.168.0.109 -m load-test

### Send one fillup request only, 512 bytes payload, 1 second timeout and 60 seconds registered lifetime

```
./slpload.py -T 60 -s 512 -t 1 -l 192.168.0.110 -m one-shot
[+] Preparing packet
[+] Sending packet Register V2...
[+] Registration accepted.
[+] Loaded up with 579 bytes

```

### Check remote registered data

```
./slpload.py -l 192.168.0.110 -m check
[+] Sending service type  request v2...
[+] Data Buffer:
b'\x02\n\x00\x02C\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x83\xf8\x00\x02en\x00\x00\x02/service:VMwareInfrastructure,service:wbem:https,slpLoadTest://alF4yQIL:31337/Y40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3ut'
[!] Host: 192.168.0.110 Buffer Size: 579 Ampfactor: 19.96551724137931

```

## Outro

On some devices / SLP implementations, the daemon stops filling the buffer after a certain point and either maintains the size or reverts to some default value.
For a DoS amplification attack and in order to optimize the amplification to the maximum an attacker just has to adjust the payload size for the device he is populating.

May the packets be with you.

                  Service Location Protocol, Version 2

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
   discovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,
   computers using the Internet need little or no static configuration
   of network services for network based applications.  This is
   especially important as computers become more portable, and users
   less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system
   administration.

[1](#section-1). Introduction

   The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides a flexible and scalable
   framework for providing hosts with access to information about the
   existence, location, and configuration of networked services.
   Traditionally, users have had to find services by knowing the name of
   a network host (a human readable text string) which is an alias for a
   network address.  SLP eliminates the need for a user to know the name
   of a network host supporting a service.  Rather, the user supplies
   the desired type of service and a set of attributes which describe
   the service.  Based on that description, the Service Location
   Protocol resolves the network address of the service for the user.

   SLP provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for applications in
   local area networks.  Applications are modeled as clients that need
   to find servers attached to any of the available networks within an
   enterprise.  For cases where there are many different clients and/or
   services available, the protocol is adapted to make use of nearby
   Directory Agents that offer a centralized repository for advertised
   services.

   This document updates SLPv1 [[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)], correcting protocol errors,
   adding some enhancements and removing some requirements.  This
   specification has two parts.  The first describes the required
   features of the protocol.  The second describes the extended features
   of the protocol which are optional, and allow greater scalability.

[1.1](#section-1.1). Applicability Statement

   SLP is intended to function within networks under cooperative
   administrative control.  Such networks permit a policy to be
   implemented regarding security, multicast routing and organization of
   services and clients into groups which are not be feasible on the
   scale of the Internet as a whole.

   SLP has been designed to serve enterprise networks with shared
   services, and it may not necessarily scale for wide-area service
   discovery throughout the global Internet, or in networks where there
   are hundreds of thousands of clients or tens of thousands of
   services.

[2](#section-2). Terminology

      User Agent (UA)
                A process working on the user's behalf to establish
                contact with some service.  The UA retrieves service
                information from the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA) A process working on the behalf of one or more
                services to advertise the services.

      Directory Agent (DA) A process which collects service
                advertisements.  There can only be one DA present per
                given host.

      Service Type Each type of service has a unique Service Type
                string.

      Naming Authority The agency or group which catalogues given
                Service Types and Attributes.  The default Naming
                Authority is IANA.

      Scope A set of services, typically making up a logical
                administrative group.

      URL A Universal Resource Locator [[8](#ref-8)].

[2.1](#section-2.1). Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](/doc/html/rfc2119)  [[9](#ref-9)].

      Syntax        Syntax for string based protocols follow the
                    conventions defined for ABNF [[11](#ref-11)].

      Strings       All strings are encoded using the UTF-8 [[23](#ref-23)]
                    transformation of the Unicode [[6](#ref-6)] character set and
                    are NOT null terminated when transmitted.  Strings
                    are preceded by a two byte length field.

      <string-list> A comma delimited list of strings with the
                    following syntax:

                       string-list = string / string `,' string-list

   In format diagrams, any field ending with a \ indicates a variable
   length field, given by a prior length field in the protocol.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

[3](#section-3). Protocol Overview

   The Service Location Protocol supports a framework by which client
   applications are modeled as 'User Agents' and services are advertised
   by 'Service Agents.'  A third entity, called a 'Directory Agent'
   provides scalability to the protocol.

   The User Agent issues a 'Service Request' (SrvRqst) on behalf of the
   client application, specifying the characteristics of the service
   which the client requires.  The User Agent will receive a Service
   Reply (SrvRply) specifying the location of all services in the
   network which satisfy the request.

   The Service Location Protocol framework allows the User Agent to
   directly issue requests to Service Agents.  In this case the request
   is multicast.  Service Agents receiving a request for a service which
   they advertise unicast a reply containing the service's location.

      +------------+ ----Multicast SrvRqst----> +---------------+
      | User Agent |                            | Service Agent |
      +------------+ <----Unicast SrvRply------ +---------------+

   In larger networks, one or more Directory Agents are used.  The
   Directory Agent functions as a cache.  Service Agents send register
   messages (SrvReg) containing all the services they advertise to
   Directory Agents and receive acknowledgements in reply (SrvAck).
   These advertisements must be refreshed with the Directory Agent or
   they expire.  User Agents unicast requests to Directory Agents
   instead of Service Agents if any Directory Agents are known.

 +-------+ -Unicast SrvRqst-> +-----------+ <-Unicast SrvReg- +--------+
 | User  |                    | Directory |                   |Service |
 | Agent |                    |   Agent   |                   | Agent  |
 +-------+ <-Unicast SrvRply- +-----------+ -Unicast SrvAck-> +--------+

   User and Service Agents discover Directory Agents two ways.  First,
   they issue a multicast Service Request for the 'Directory Agent'
   service when they start up.  Second, the Directory Agent sends an
   unsolicited advertisement infrequently, which the User and Service
   Agents listen for.  In either case the Agents receive a DA
    Advertisement (DAAdvert).

        +---------------+ --Multicast SrvRqst-> +-----------+
        |    User or    | <--Unicast DAAdvert-- | Directory |
        | Service Agent |                       |   Agent   |
        +---------------+ <-Multicast DAAdvert- +-----------+

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   Services are grouped together using 'scopes'.  These are strings
   which identify services which are administratively identified.  A
   scope could indicate a location, administrative grouping, proximity
   in a network topology or some other category.  Service Agents and
   Directory Agents are always assigned a scope string.

   A User Agent is normally assigned a scope string (in which case the
   User Agent will only be able to discover that particular grouping of
   services).  This allows a network administrator to 'provision'
   services to users.  Alternatively, the User Agent may be configured
   with no scope at all.  In that case, it will discover all available
   scopes and allow the client application to issue requests for any
   service available on the network.

   +---------+   Multicast  +-----------+   Unicast   +-----------+
   | Service | <--SrvRqst-- |   User    | --SrvRqst-> | Directory |
   |  Agent  |              |   Agent   |             |   Agent   |
   | Scope=X |   Unicast    | Scope=X,Y |   Unicast   |  Scope=Y  |
   +---------+ --SrvRply--> +-----------+ <-SrvRply-- +-----------+

   In the above illustration, the User Agent is configured with scopes X
   and Y. If a service is sought in scope X, the request is multicast.
   If it is sought in scope Y, the request is unicast to the DA.
   Finally, if the request is to be made in both scopes, the request
   must be both unicast and multicast.

   Service Agents and User Agents may verify digital signatures provided
   with DAAdverts.  User Agents and Directory Agents may verify service
   information registered by Service Agents.  The keying material to use
   to verify digital signatures is identified using a SLP Security
   Parameter Index, or SLP SPI.

   Every host configured to generate a digital signature includes the
   SLP SPI used to verify it in the Authentication Block it transmits.
   Every host which can verify a digital signature must be configured
   with keying material and other parameters corresponding with the SLP
   SPI such that it can perform verifying calculations.

   SAs MUST accept multicast service requests and unicast service
   requests.  SAs MAY accept other requests (Attribute and Service Type
   Requests).  SAs MUST listen for multicast DA Advertisements.

   The features described up to this point are required to implement.  A
   minimum implementation consists of a User Agent, Service Agent or
   both.

   There are several optional features in the protocol.  Note that DAs
   MUST support all these message types, but DA support is itself

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   optional to deploy on networks using SLP. UAs and SAs MAY support
   these message types.  These operations are primarily for interactive
   use (browsing or selectively updating service registrations.)  UAs
   and SAs either support them or not depending on the requirements and
   constraints of the environment where they will be used.

  Service Type Request   A request for all types of service on the
                         network.  This allows generic service browsers
                         to be built.

  Service Type Reply     A reply to a Service Type Request.

  Attribute Request      A request for attributes of a given type of
                         service or attributes of a given service.

  Attribute Reply        A reply to an Attribute Request.

  Service Deregister     A request to deregister a service or some
                         attributes of a service.

  Service Update         A subsequent SrvRqst to an advertisement.
                         This allows individual dynamic attributes to
                         be updated.

  SA Advertisement       In the absence of Directory Agents, a User
                         agent may request Service Agents in order
                         to discover their scope configuration.  The
                         User Agent may use these scopes in requests.

   In the absence of Multicast support, Broadcast MAY be used.  The
   location of DAs may be staticly configured, discovered using SLP as
   described above, or configured using DHCP. If a message is too large,
   it may be unicast using TCP.

   A SLPv2 implementation SHOULD support SLPv1 [[22](#ref-22)].  This support
   includes:

    1. SLPv2 DAs are deployed, phasing out SLPv1 DAs.

    2. Unscoped SLPv1 requests are considered to be of DEFAULT scope.
       SLPv1 UAs MUST be reconfigured to have a scope if possible.

    3. There is no way for an SLPv2 DA to behave as an unscoped SLPv1
       DA. SLPv1 SAs MUST be reconfigured to have a scope if possible.

    4. SLPv2 DAs answer SLPv1 requests with SLPv1 replies and SLPv2
       requests with SLPv2 replies.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

    5. SLPv2 DAs use registrations from SLPv1 and SLPv2 in the same
       way.  That is, incoming requests from agents using either version
       of the protocol will be matched against this common set of
       registered services.

    6. SLPv2 registrations which use Language Tags which are greater
       than 2 characters long will be inaccessible to SLPv1 UAs.

    7. SLPv2 DAs MUST return only service type strings in SrvTypeRply
       messages which conform to SLPv1 service type string syntax, ie.
       they MUST NOT return Service Type strings for abstract service
       types.

    8. SLPv1 SrvRqsts and AttrRqsts by Service Type do not match Service
       URLs with abstract service types.  They only match Service URLs
       with concrete service types.

   SLPv1 UAs will not receive replies from SLPv2 SAs and SLPv2 UAs will
   not receive replies from SLPv1 SAs.  In order to interoperate UAs and
   SAs of different versions require a SLPv2 DA to be present on the
   network which supports both protocols.

   The use of abstract service types in SLPv2 presents a backward
   compatibility issue for SLPv1.  It is possible that a SLPv1 UA will
   request a service type which is actually an abstract service type.
   Based on the rules above, the SLPv1 UA will never receive an abstract
   Service URL reply.  For example, the service type 'service:x' in a
   SLPv1 AttrRqst will not return the attributes of 'service:x:y://orb'.
   If the request was made with SLPv2, it would return the attributes of
   this service.

[4](#section-4). URLs used with Service Location

   A Service URL indicates the location of a service.  This URL may be
   of the service: scheme [[13](#ref-13)] (reviewed in [section 4.1](#section-4.1)), or any other
   URL scheme conforming to the URI standard [[8](#ref-8)], except that URLs
   without address specifications SHOULD NOT be advertised by SLP. The
   service type for an 'generic' URL is its scheme name.  For example,
   the service type string for "http://www.srvloc.org" would be "http".

   Reserved characters in URLs follow the rules in [RFC 2396](/doc/html/rfc2396) [[8](#ref-8)].

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

[4.1](#section-4.1). Service: URLs

   Service URL syntax and semantics are defined in  [[13](#ref-13)].  Any network
   service may be encoded in a Service URL.

   This section provides an introduction to Service URLs and an example
   showing a simple application of them, representing standard network
   services.

   A Service URL may be of the form:

      "service:"<srvtype>"://"<addrspec>

   The Service Type of this service: URL is defined to be the string up
   to (but not including) the final `:'  before <addrspec>, the address
   specification.

   <addrspec> is a hostname (which should be used if possible) or dotted
   decimal notation for a hostname, followed by an optional `:'  and
   port number.

   A service: scheme URL may be formed with any standard protocol name
   by concatenating "service:" and the reserved port [[1](#ref-1)] name.  For
   example, "service:tftp://myhost" would indicate a tftp service.  A
   tftp service on a nonstandard port could be
   "service:tftp://bad.glad.org:8080".

   Service Types SHOULD be defined by a "Service Template" [[13](#ref-13)], which
   provides expected attributes, values and protocol behavior.  An
   abstract service type (also described in [[13](#ref-13)]) has the form

      "service:<abstract-type>:<concrete-type>".

   The service type string "service:<abstract-type>" matches all
   services of that abstract type.  If the concrete type is included
   also, only these services match the request.  For example:  a SrvRqst
   or AttrRqst which specifies "service:printer" as the Service Type
   will match the URL service:printer:lpr://hostname and
   service:printer:http://hostname.  If the requests specified
   "service:printer:http" they would match only the latter URL.

   An optional substring MAY follow the last `.'  character in the
   <srvtype> (or <abstract-type> in the case of an abstract service type
   URL). This substring is the Naming Authority, as described in [Section](#section-9.6)
   [9.6](#section-9.6).  Service types with different Naming Authorities are quite
   distinct.  In other words, service:x.one and service:x.two are
   different service types, as are service:abstract.one:y and
   service:abstract.two:y.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

[4.2](#section-4.2). Naming Authorities

   A Naming Authority MAY optionally be included as part of the Service
   Type string.  The Naming Authority of a service defines the meaning
   of the Service Types and attributes registered with and provided by
   Service Location.  The Naming Authority itself is typically a string
   which uniquely identifies an organization.  IANA is the implied
   Naming Authority when no string is appended.  "IANA" itself MUST NOT
   be included explicitly.

   Naming Authorities may define Service Types which are experimental,
   proprietary or for private use.  Using a Naming Authority, one may
   either simply ignore attributes upon registration or create a local-
   use only set of attributes for one's site.  The procedure to use is
   to create a 'unique' Naming Authority string and then specify the
   Standard Attribute Definitions as described above.  This Naming
   Authority will accompany registration and queries, as described in
   Sections [8.1](#section-8.1) and [8.3](#section-8.3).  Service Types SHOULD be registered with IANA
   to allow for Internet-wide interoperability.

   SLP stores URLs in protocol elements called URL Entries, which
   associate a length, a lifetime, and possibly authentication
   information along with the URL. URL Entries, defined as shown above,
   are used in Service Replies and Service Registrations.

[5](#section-5). Service Attributes

   A service advertisement is often accompanied by Service Attributes.
   These attributes are used by UAs in Service Requests to select
   appropriate services.

   The allowable attributes which may be used are typically specified by
   a Service Template  [[13](#ref-13)] for a particular service type.  Services
   which are advertised according to a standard template MUST register
   all service attributes which the standard template requires.  URLs
   with schemes other than "service:" MAY be registered with attributes.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   Non-standard attribute names SHOULD begin with "x-", because no
   standard attribute name will ever have those initial characters.

   An attribute list is a string encoding of the attributes of a
   service.  The following ABNF [[11](#ref-11)] grammar defines attribute lists:

   attr-list = attribute / attribute `,' attr-list
   attribute = `(' attr-tag `=' attr-val-list `)' / attr-tag
   attr-val-list = attr-val / attr-val `,' attr-val-list
   attr-tag = 1*safe-tag
   attr-val = intval / strval / boolval / opaque
   intval = [-]1*DIGIT
   strval = 1*safe-val
   boolval = "true" / "false"
   opaque = "\FF" 1*escape-val
   safe-val = ; Any character except reserved.
   safe-tag = ; Any character except reserved, star and bad-tag.
   reserved = `(' / `)' / `,' / `\' / `!'  / `<' / `=' / `>' / `~' / CTL
   escape-val = `\' HEXDIG HEXDIG
   bad-tag = CR / LF / HTAB / `_'
    star = `*'

   The <attr-list>, if present, MUST be scanned prior to evaluation for
   all occurrences of the escape character `\'.  Reserved characters
   MUST be escaped (other characters MUST NOT be escaped).  All escaped
   characters must be restored to their value before attempting string
   matching.  For Opaque values, escaped characters are not converted -
   they are interpreted as bytes.

      Boolean      Strings which have the form "true" or "false" can
                   only take one value and may only be compared with
                   '='.  Booleans are case insensitive when compared.

      Integer      Strings which take the form [-] 1*<digit> and fall
                   in the range "-2147483648" to "2147483647" are
                   considered to be Integers.  These are compared using
                   integer comparison.

      String       All other Strings are matched using strict lexical
                   ordering (see [Section 6.4](#section-6.4)).

      Opaque       Opaque values are sequences of bytes.  These are
                   distinguished from Strings since they begin with
                   the sequence "\FF".  This, unescaped, is an illegal
                   UTF-8 encoding, indicating that what follows is a
                   sequence of bytes expressed in escape notation which
                   constitute the binary value.  For example, a '0' byte
                   is encoded "\FF\00".

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   A string which contains escaped values other than from the reserved
   set of characters is illegal.  If such a string is included in an
   <attr-list>, <tag-list> or search filter, the SA or DA which receives
   it MUST return a PARSE_ERROR to the message.

   A keyword has only an <attr-tag>, and no values.  Attributes can have
   one or multiple values.  All values are expressed as strings.

   When values have been advertised by a SA or are registered in a DA,
   they can take on implicit typing rules for matching incoming
   requests.

   Stored values must be consistent, i.e., x=4,true,sue,\ff\00\00 is
   disallowed.  A DA or SA receiving such an <attr-list> MUST return an
   INVALID_REGISTRATION error.

[6](#section-6). Required Features

   This section defines the minimal implementation requirements for SAs
   and UAs as well as their interaction with DAs.  A DA is not required
   for SLP to function, but if it is present, the UA and SA MUST
   interact with it as defined below.

   A minimal implementation may consist of either a UA or SA or both.
   The only required features of a UA are that it can issue SrvRqsts
   according to the rules below and interpret DAAdverts, SAAdverts and
   SrvRply messages.  The UA MUST issue requests to DAs as they are
   discovered.  An SA MUST reply to appropriate SrvRqsts with SrvRply or
   SAAdvert messages.  The SA MUST also register with DAs as they are
   discovered.

   UAs perform discovery by issuing Service Request messages.  SrvRqst
   messages are issued, using UDP, following these prioritized rules:

    1. A UA issues a request to a DA which it has been configured with
       by DHCP.

    2. A UA issues requests to DAs which it has been statically
       configured with.

    3. UA uses multicast/convergence SrvRqsts to discover DAs, then uses
       that set of DAs.  A UA that does not know of any DAs SHOULD retry
       DA discovery, increasing the waiting interval between subsequent
       attempts exponentially (doubling the wait interval each time.)
       The recommended minimum waiting interval is CONFIG_DA_FIND
       seconds.

Guttman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 12]

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

    4. A UA with no knowledge of DAs sends requests using multicast
       convergence to SAs.  SAs unicast replies to UAs according to the
       multicast convergence algorithm.

   UAs and SAs are configured with a list of scopes to use according to
   these prioritized rules:

    1. With DHCP.

    2. With static configuration.  The static configuration may be
       explicitly set to NO SCOPE for UAs, if the User Selectable Scope
       model is used.  See [section 11.2](#section-11.2).

    3. In the absence of configuration, the agent's scope is "DEFAULT".

   A UA MUST issue requests with one or more of the scopes it has been
   configured to use.

   A UA which has been statically configured with NO SCOPE LIST will use
   DA or SA discovery to determine its scope list dynamically.  In this
   case it uses an empty scope list to discover DAs and possibly SAs.
   Then it uses the scope list it obtains from DAAdverts and possibly
   SAAdverts in subsequent requests.

   The SA MUST register all its services with any DA it discovers, if
   the DA advertises any of the scopes it has been configured with.  A
   SA obtains information about DAs as a UA does.  In addition, the SA
   MUST listen for multicast unsolicited DAAdverts.  The SA registers by
   sending SrvReg messages to DAs, which reply with SrvReg messages to
   indicate success.  SAs register in ALL the scopes they were
   configured to use.

[6.1](#section-6.1). Use of Ports, UDP, and Multicast

   DAs MUST accept unicast requests and multicast directory agent
   discovery service requests (for the service type "service:directory-
   agent").

   SAs MUST accept multicast requests and unicast requests both.  The SA
   can distinguish between them by whether the REQUEST MCAST flag is set
   in the SLP Message header.

   The Service Location Protocol uses multicast for discovering DAs and
   for issuing requests to SAs by default.

   The reserved listening port for SLP is 427.  This is the destination
   port for all SLP messages.  SLP messages MAY be transmitted on an
   ephemeral port.  Replies and acknowledgements are sent to the port

Guttman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 13]

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   from which the request was issued.  The default maximum transmission
   unit for UDP messages is 1400 bytes excluding UDP and other headers.

   If a SLP message does not fit into a UDP datagram it MUST be
   truncated to fit, and the OVERFLOW flag is set in the reply message.
   A UA which receives a truncated message MAY open a TCP connection
   (see [section 6.2](#section-6.2)) with the DA or SA and retransmit the request, using
   the same XID. It MAY also attempt to make use of the truncated reply
   or reformulate a more restrictive request which will result in a
   smaller reply.

   SLP Requests messages are multicast to The Administratively Scoped
   SLP Multicast [[17](#ref-17)] address, which is 239.255.255.253.  The default
   TTL to use for multicast is 255.

   In isolated networks, broadcasts will work in place of multicast.  To
   that end, SAs SHOULD and DAs MUST listen for broadcast Service
   Location messages at port 427.  This allows UAs which do not support
   multicast the use of Service Location on isolated networks.

   Setting multicast TTL to less than 255 (the default) limits the range
   of SLP discovery in a network, and localizes service information in
   the network.

[6.2](#section-6.2). Use of TCP

   A SrvReg or SrvDeReg may be too large to fit into a datagram.  To
   send such large SLP messages, a TCP (unicast) connection MUST be
   established.

   To avoid the need to implement TCP, one MUST insure that:

    -  UAs never issue requests larger than the Path MTU. SAs can omit
       TCP support only if they never have to receive unicast requests
       longer than the path MTU.

    -  UAs can accept replies with the 'OVERFLOW' flag set, and make use
       of the first result included, or reformulate the request.

    -  Ensure that a SA can send a SrvRply, SrvReg, or SrvDeReg in
       a single datagram.  This means limiting the size of URLs,
       the number of attributes and the number of authenticators
       transmitted.

   DAs MUST be able to respond to UDP and TCP requests, as well as
   multicast DA Discovery SrvRqsts.  SAs MUST be able to respond to TCP
   unless the SA will NEVER receive a request or send a reply which will
   exceed a datagram in size (e.g., some embedded systems).

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   A TCP connection MAY be used for a single SLP transaction, or for
   multiple transactions.  Since there are length fields in the message
   headers, SLP Agents can send multiple requests along a connection and
   read the return stream for acknowledgments and replies.

   The initiating agent SHOULD close the TCP connection.  The DA SHOULD
   wait at least CONFIG_CLOSE_CONN seconds before closing an idle
   connection.  DAs and SAs SHOULD close an idle TCP connection after
   CONFIG_CLOSE_CONN seconds to ensure robust operation, even when the
   initiating agent neglects to close it.  See [Section 13](#section-13) for timing
   rules.

[6.3](#section-6.3). Retransmission of SLP messages

   Requests which fail to elicit a response are retransmitted.  The
   initial retransmission occurs after a CONFIG_RETRY wait period.
   Retransmissions MUST be made with exponentially increasing wait
   intervals (doubling the wait each time).  This applies to unicast as
   well as multicast SLP requests.

   Unicast requests to a DA or SA should be retransmitted until either a
   response (which might be an error) has been obtained, or for
   CONFIG_RETRY_MAX seconds.

   Multicast requests SHOULD be reissued over CONFIG_MC_MAX seconds
   until a result has been obtained.  UAs need only wait till they
   obtain the first reply which matches their request.  That is,
   retransmission is not required if the requesting agent is prepared to
   use the 'first reply' instead of 'as many replies as possible within
   a bounded time interval.'

   When SLP SrvRqst, SrvTypeRqst, and AttrRqst messages are multicast,
   they contain a <PRList> of previous responders.  Initially the
   <PRList> is empty.  When these requests are unicast, the <PRList> is
   always empty.

   Any DA or SA which sees its address in the <PRList> MUST NOT respond
   to the request.

   The message SHOULD be retransmitted until the <PRList> causes no
   further responses to be elicited or the previous responder list and
   the request will not fit into a single datagram or until
   CONFIG_MC_MAX seconds elapse.

   UAs which retransmit a request use the same XID. This allows a DA or
   SA to cache its reply to the original request and then send it again,
   should a duplicate request arrive.  This cached information should
   only be held very briefly.  XIDs SHOULD be randomly chosen to avoid

   duplicate XIDs in requests if UAs restart frequently.

[6.4](#section-6.4). Strings in SLP messages

   The escape character is a backslash (UTF-8 0x5c) followed by the two
   hexadecimal digits of the escaped character.  Only reserved
   characters are escaped.  For example, a comma (UTF-8 0x29) is escaped
   as `\29', and a backslash `\' is escaped as `\5c'.  String lists used
   in SLP define the comma to be the delimiter between list elements, so
   commas in data strings must be escaped in this manner.  Backslashes
   are the escape character so they also must always be escaped when
   included in a string literally.

   String comparison for order and equality in SLP MUST be case
   insensitive inside the 0x00-0x7F subrange of UTF-8 (which corresponds
   to ASCII character encoding).  Case insensitivity SHOULD be supported
   throughout the entire UTF-8 encoded Unicode [[6](#ref-6)] character set.

   The case insensitivity rule applies to all string matching in SLPv2,
   including Scope strings, SLP SPI strings, service types, attribute
   tags and values in query handling, language tags, previous responder
   lists.  Comparisons of URL strings, however, is case sensitive.

   White space (SPACE, CR, LF, TAB) internal to a string value is folded
   to a single SPACE character for the sake of string comparisons.
   White space preceding or following a string value is ignored for the
   purposes of string comparison.  For example, "  Some String  "
   matches "SOME    STRING".

   String comparisons (using comparison operators such as `<=' or `>=')
   are done using lexical ordering in UTF-8 encoded characters, not
   using any language specific rules.

   The reserved character `*' may precede, follow or be internal to a
   string value in order to indicate substring matching.  The query
   including this character matches any character sequence which
   conforms to the letters which are not wildcarded.

[6.4.1](#section-6.4.1). Scope Lists in SLP

   Scope Lists in SLPv2 have the following grammar:

   scope-list = scope-val / scope-val `,' scope-list
   scope-val = 1*safe
    safe = ; Any character except reserved.
   reserved = `(' / `)' / `,' / `\' / `!'  / `<' / `=' / `>' / `~' / CTL
         / `;' / `*' / `+'
   escape-val = `\' HEXDIG HEXDIG

Guttman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 16]
```

---

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   Scopes which include any reserved characters must replace the escaped
   character with the escaped-val format.

[7](#section-7). Errors

   If the Error Code in a SLP reply message is nonzero, the rest of the
   message MAY be truncated.  No data is necessarily transmitted or
   should be expected after the header and the error code, except
   possibly for some optional extensions to clarify the error, for
   example as in section D.1.

   Errors are only returned for unicast requests.  Multicast requests
   are silently discarded if they result in an error.

   LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED = 1: There is data for the service type in
         the scope in the AttrRqst or SrvRqst, but not in the requested
         language.
   PARSE_ERROR = 2: The message fails to obey SLP syntax.
   INVALID_REGISTRATION = 3: The SrvReg has problems -- e.g., a zero
         lifetime or an omitted Language Tag.
   SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED = 4: The SLP message did not include a scope in
         its <scope-list> supported by the SA or DA.
   AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN = 5: The DA or SA receives a request for an
         unsupported SLP SPI.
   AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT = 6: The DA expected URL and ATTR
         authentication in the SrvReg and did not receive it.
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED = 7: The DA detected an authentication error in
         an Authentication block.
   VER_NOT_SUPPORTED = 9: Unsupported version number in message header.
   INTERNAL_ERROR = 10: The DA (or SA) is too sick to respond.
   DA_BUSY_NOW = 11: UA or SA SHOULD retry, using exponential back off.
   OPTION_NOT_UNDERSTOOD = 12: The DA (or SA) received an unknown option
         from the mandatory range (see [section 9.1](#section-9.1)).
   INVALID_UPDATE = 13: The DA received a SrvReg without FRESH set, for
         an unregistered service or with inconsistent Service Types.
   MSG_NOT_SUPPORTED = 14: The SA received an AttrRqst or SrvTypeRqst
         and does not support it.
   REFRESH_REJECTED = 15: The SA sent a SrvReg or partial SrvDereg to a
         DA more frequently than the DA's min-refresh-interval.

[8](#section-8). Required SLP Messages

   All length fields in SLP messages are in network byte order.  Where '
   tuples' are defined, these are sequences of bytes, in the precise
   order listed, in network byte order.

   SLP messages all begin with the following header:

       or broadcasting requests.  Reserved bits MUST be 0.
     - Next Extension Offset is set to 0 unless extensions are used.
       The first extension begins at 'offset' bytes, from the message's
       beginning.  It is placed after the SLP message data.  See
       [Section 9.1](#section-9.1) for how to interpret unrecognized SLP Extensions.
     - XID is set to a unique value for each unique request.  If the
       request is retransmitted, the same XID is used.  Replies set
       the XID to the same value as the xid in the request.  Only
       unsolicited DAAdverts are sent with an XID of 0.
     - Lang Tag Length is the length in bytes of the Language Tag field.
     - Language Tag conforms to [[7](#ref-7)].  The Language Tag in a reply MUST
       be the same as the Language Tag in the request.  This field must

   In order for a Service to match a SrvRqst, it must belong to at least
   one requested scope, support the requested service type, and match
   the predicate.  If the predicate is present, the language of the
   request (ignoring the dialect part of the Language Tag) must match
   the advertised service.

   <PRList> is the Previous Responder List.  This <string-list> contains
   dotted decimal notation IP (v4) addresses, and is iteratively
   multicast to obtain all possible results (see [Section 6.3](#section-6.3)).  UAs
   SHOULD implement this discovery algorithm.  SAs MUST use this to
   discover all available DAs in their scope, if they are not already
   configured with DA addresses by some other means.

   A SA silently drops all requests which include the SA's address in
   the <PRList>.  An SA which has multiple network interfaces MUST check
   if any of the entries in the <PRList> equal any of its interfaces.
   An entry in the PRList which does not conform to an IPv4 dotted
   decimal address is ignored:  The rest of the <PRList> is processed
   normally and an error is not returned.

   Once a <PRList> plus the request exceeds the path MTU, multicast
   convergence stops.  This algorithm is not intended to find all
   instances; it finds 'enough' to provide useful results.

   The <scope-list> is a <string-list> of configured scope names.  SAs
   and DAs which have been configured with any of the scopes in this
   list will respond.  DAs and SAs MUST reply to unicast requests with a

   SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error if the <scope-list> is omitted or fails to
   include a scope they support (see [Section 11](#section-11)).  The only exceptions
   to this are described in [Section 11.2](#section-11.2).

   The <service-type> string is discussed in [Section 4](#section-4).  Normally, a
   SrvRqst elicits a SrvRply.  There are two exceptions:  If the
   <service-type> is set to "service:directory-agent", DAs respond to
   the SrvRqst with a DAAdvert (see [Section 8.5](#section-8.5).)  If set to
   "service:service-agent", SAs respond with a SAAdvert (see [Section](#section-8.6)
   [8.6](#section-8.6).)  If this field is omitted, a PARSE_ERROR is returned - as this
   field is REQUIRED.

   The <predicate> is a LDAPv3 search filter [[14](#ref-14)].  This field is
   OPTIONAL. Services may be discovered simply by type and scope.
   Otherwise, services are discovered which satisfy the <predicate>.  If
   present, it is compared to each registered service.  If the attribute
   in the filter has been registered with multiple values, the filter is
   compared to each value and the results are ORed together, i.e.,
   "(x=3)" matches a registration of (x=1,2,3); "(!(Y=0))" matches
   (y=0,1) since Y can be nonzero.  Note the matching is case
   insensitive.  Keywords (i.e., attributes without values) are matched
   with a "presence" filter, as in "(keyword=*)".

   An incoming request term MUST have the same type as the attribute in
   a registration in order to match.  Thus, "(x=33)" will not match '
   x=true', etc.  while "(y=foo)" will match 'y=FOO'.
   "(|(x=33)(y=foo))" will be satisfied, even though "(x=33)" cannot be
   satisfied, because of the `|' (boolean disjunction).

   Wildcard matching MUST be done with the '=' filter.  In any other
   case, a PARSE_ERROR is returned.  Request terms which include
   wildcards are interpreted to be Strings.  That is, (x=34*) would
   match 'x=34foo', but not 'x=3432' since the first value is a String
   while the second value is an Integer; Strings don't match Integers.

   Examples of Predicates follow.  <t> indicates the service type of the
   SrvRqst, <s> gives the <scope-list> and <p> is the predicate string.

      <t>=service:http  <s>=DEFAULT  <p>=  (empty string)
               This is a minimal request string.  It matches all http
               services advertised with the default scope.

      <t>=service:pop3  <s>=SALES,DEFAULT  <p>=(user=wump)
               This is a request for all pop3 services available in
               the SALES or DEFAULT scope which serve mail to the user
               `wump'.

      <t>=service:backup  <s>=BLDG 32  <p>=(&(q<=3)(speed>=1000))
               This returns the backup service which has a queue length
               less than 3 and a speed greater than 1000.  It will
               return this only for services registered with the BLDG 32
               scope.

      <t>=service:directory-agent  <s>=DEFAULT  <p>=
               This returns DAAdverts for all DAs in the DEFAULT scope.

   DAs are discovered by sending a SrvRqst with the service type set to
   "service:directory-agent".  If a predicate is included in the
   SrvRqst, the DA SHOULD respond only if the predicate can be satisfied
   with the DA's attributes.  The <scope-list> MUST contain all scopes
   configured for the UA or SA which is discovering DAs.

   The <SLP SPI> string indicates a SLP SPI that the requester has been
   configured with.  If this string is omitted, the responder does not
   include any Authentication Blocks in its reply.  If it is included,
   the responder MUST return a reply which has an associated
   authentication block with the SLP SPI in the SrvRqst.  If no replies
   may be returned because the SLP SPI is not supported, the responder
   returns an AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN error.

   present.  A service reply with zero URL entries MUST NOT be sent in
   response to a multicast or broadcast service request (instead, if
   there was no match found or an error processing the request, the
   service reply should not be generated at all).

   If the reply overflows, the UA MAY simply use the first URL Entry in

   URL Authenticator (see [Section 9.2](#section-9.2)).

   An authentication block is returned in the URL Entries, including the

   The <entry> is a URL Entry (see [section 4.3](#section-4.3)).  The Lifetime defines
   how long a DA can cache the registration.  SAs SHOULD reregister
   before this lifetime expires (but SHOULD NOT more often than once per
   second).  The Lifetime MAY be set to any value between 0 and 0xffff
   (maximum, around 18 hours).  Long-lived registrations remain stale
   longer if the service fails and the SA does not deregister the
   service.

   The <service-type> defines the service type of the URL to be
   registered, regardless of the scheme of the URL. The <scope-list>
   MUST contain the names of all scopes configured for the SA, which the
   DA it is registering with supports.  The default value for the
   <scope-list> is "DEFAULT" (see [Section 11](#section-11)).

   The SA MUST register consistently with all DAs.  If a SA is
   configured with scopes X and Y and there are three DAs, whose scopes
   are "X", "Y" and "X,Y" respectively, the SA will register the with
   all three DAs in their respective scopes.  All future updates and
   deregistrations of the service must be sent to the same set of DAs in

   the same scopes the service was initially registered in.

   The <attr-list>, if present, specifies the attributes and values to
   be associated with the URL by the DA (see [Section 5](#section-5)).

   A SA configured with the ability to sign service registrations MUST
   sign each of the URLs and Attribute Lists using each of the keys it
   is configured to use, and the DA it is registering with accepts.
   (The SA MUST acquire DAAdverts for all DAs it will register with to
   obtain the DA's SLP SPI list and attributes, as described in [Section](#section-8.5)
   [8.5](#section-8.5)).  The SA supplies a SLP SPI in each authentication block
   indicating the SLP SPI configuration required to verify the digital
   signature.  The format of the digital signatures used is defined in
   [section 9.2.1](#section-9.2.1).

   Subsequent registrations of previously registered services MUST
   contain the same list of SLP SPIs as previous ones or else DAs will
   reject them, replying with an AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT error.

   A registration with the FRESH flag set will replace *entirely* any
   previous registration for the same URL in the same language.  If the

   The Error Code is set to 0 when the DAAdvert is multicast.  If the
   DAAdvert is being returned due to a unicast SrvRqst (ie.  a request
   without the REQUEST MCAST flag set) the DA returns the same errors a
   SrvRply would.

   The <scope-list> of the SrvRqst must either be omitted or include a
   scope which the DA supports.  The DA Stateless Boot Timestamp
   indicates the state of the DA (see [section 12.1](#section-12.1)).

   The DA MAY include a list of its attributes in the DAAdvert.  This
   list SHOULD be kept short, as the DAAdvert must fit into a datagram
   in order to be multicast.

   A potential scaling problem occurs in SLPv2 if SAs choose too low a
   Lifetime.  In this case, an onerous amount of reregistration occurs
   as more services are deployed.  SLPv2 allows DAs to control SAs
   frequency of registration.  A DA MAY reissue a DAAdvert with a new
   set of attributes at any time, to change the reregistration behavior
   of SAs.  These apply only to subsequent registrations; existing
   service registrations with the DA retain their registered lifetimes.

   If the DAAdvert includes the attribute "min-refresh-interval" it MUST
   be set to a single Integer value indicating a number of seconds.  If
   this attribute is present SAs MUST NOT refresh any particular service
   advertisement more frequently than this value.  If SrvReg with the

   particular service are received more often than the value for the
   DA's advertised "min-refresh-interval" attribute the DA SHOULD reject
   the message and return a REFRESH_REJECTED error in the SrvAck.

   The URL is "service:directory-agent://"<addr> of the DA, where <addr>
   is the dotted decimal numeric address of the DA. The <scope-list> of
   the DA MUST NOT be NULL.

   The SLP SPI List is the list of SPIs that the DA is capable of
   verifying.  SAs MUST NOT register services with authentication blocks
   for those SLP SPIs which are not on the list.  DAs will reject
   service registrations which they cannot verify, returning an
   AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN error.

   The format of DAAdvert signatures is defined in [Section 9.2.1](#section-9.2.1).

   The SLP SPI which is used to verify the DAAdvert is included in the
   Authentication Block.  When DAAdverts are multicast, they may have to
   transmit multiple DAAdvert Authentication Blocks.  If the DA is
   configured to be able to generate signatures for more than one SPI,
   the DA MUST include one Authentication Block for each SPI.  If all
   these Authentication Blocks do not fit in a single datagram (to
   multicast or broadcast) the DA MUST send separate DAAdverts so that
   Authentication Blocks for all the SPIs the DA is capable of
   generating are sent.

   If the DAAdvert is being sent in response to a SrvRqst, the DAAdvert
   contains only the authentication block with the SLP SPI in the
   SrvRqst, if the DA is configured to be able to produce digital
   signatures using that SLP SPI. If the SrvRqst is unicast to the DA
   (the REQUEST MCAST flag in the header is not set) and an unsupported
   SLP SPI is included, the DA replies with a DAAdvert with the Error
   Code set to an AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN error.

   UAs SHOULD be configured with SLP SPIs that will allow them to verify
   DA Advertisements.  If the UA is configured with SLP SPIs and
   receives a DAAdvert which fails to be verified using one of them, the
   UA MUST discard it.

[8.6](#section-8.6). Service Agent Advertisement

   User Agents MUST NOT solicit SA Advertisements if they have been
   configured to use a particular DA, if they have been configured with
   a <scope-list> or if DAs have been discovered.  UAs solicit SA
   Advertisements only when they are explicitly configured to use User
   Selectable scopes (see [Section 11.2](#section-11.2)) in order to discover the scopes
   that SAs support.  This allows UAs without scope configuration to
   make use of either DAs or SAs without any functional difference

   The SAAdvert MAY include a list of attributes the SA supports.  This
   attribute list SHOULD be kept short so that the SAAdvert will not
   exceed the path MTU in size.

   The URL is "service:service-agent://"<addr> of the SA, where <addr>
   is the dotted decimal numeric address of the SA. The <scope-list> of
   the SA MUST NOT be null.

   The SAAdvert contains one SAAdvert Authentication block for each SLP
   SPI the SA can produce Authentication Blocks for.  If the UA can
   verify the Authentication Block of the SAAdvert, and the SAAdvert
   fails to be verified, the UA MUST discard it.

   The features described in this section are not mandatory.  Some are
   useful for interactive use of SLP (where a user rather than a program
   will select services, using a browsing interface for example) and for

   Extension IDs are assigned in the following way:

   0x0000-0x3FFF Standardized.  Optional to implement.  Ignore if
         unrecognized.
   0x4000-0x7FFF Standardized.  Mandatory to implement.  A UA or SA
         which receives this option in a reply and does not understand
         it MUST silently discard the reply.  A DA or SA which receives
         this option in a request and does not understand it MUST return
         an OPTION_NOT_UNDERSTOOD error.
   0x8000-0x8FFF For private use (not standardized).  Optional to
         implement.  Ignore if unrecognized.
   0x9000-0xFFFF Reserved.

   The three byte offset to next extension indicates the position of the
   next extension as offset from the beginning of the SLP message.

   The offset value is 0 if there are no extensions following the
   current extension.

   If the offset is 0, the length of the current Extension Data is
   determined by subtracting total length of the SLP message as given in
   the SLP message header minus the offset of the current extension.

   Extensions defined in this document are in Section D.  See [section 15](#section-15)
   for procedures that are required when specifying new SLP extensions.

   Authentication blocks are returned with certain SLP messages to
   verify that the contents have not been modified, and have been
   transmitted by an authorized agent.  The authentication data
   (contained in the Structured Authentication Block) is typically case
   sensitive.  Even though SLP registration data (e.g., attribute
   values) are typically are not case sensitive, the case of the
   registration data has to be preserved by the registering DA so that
   UAs will be able to verify the data used for calculating digital
   signature data.

   The Block Structure Descriptor (BSD) identifies the format of the
   Authenticator which follows.  BSDs 0x0000-0x7FFF will be maintained
   by IANA. BSDs 0x8000-0x8FFF are for private use.

   The Authentication Block Length is the length of the entire block,
   starting with the BSD.

   The Timestamp is the time that the authenticator expires (to prevent
   replay attacks.)  The Timestamp is a 32-bit unsigned fixed-point
   number of seconds relative to 0h on 1 January 1970.  SAs use this
   value to indicate when the validity of the digital signature expires.
   This Timestamp will wrap back to 0 in the year 2106.  Once the value
   of the Timestamp wraps, the time at which the Timestamp is relative
   to resets.  For example, after 06h28 and 16 seconds 5 February 2106,
   all Timestamp values will be relative to that epoch date.

   The SLP Security Parameters Index (SPI) string identifies the key
   length, algorithm parameters and keying material to be used by agents
   to verify the signature data in the Structured Authentication Block.
   The SLP SPI string has the same grammar as the <scope-val> defined in
   [Section 6.4.1](#section-6.4.1).

   Reserved characters in SLP SPI strings must be escaped using the same
   convention as used throughout SLPv2.

   SLP SPIs deployed in a site MUST be unique.  An SLP SPI used for
   BSD=0x0002 must not be the same as used for some other BSD.

   All SLP agents MUST implement DSA [[20](#ref-20)] (BSD=0x0002).  SAs MUST
   register services with DSA authentication blocks, and they MAY
   register them with other authentication blocks using other
   algorithms.  SAs MUST use DSA authentication blocks in SrvDeReg
   messages and DAs MUST use DSA authentication blocks in unsolicited
   DAAdverts.

[9.2.1](#section-9.2.1). SLP Message Authentication Rules

   The sections below define how to calculate the value to apply to the
   algorithm identified by the BSD value.  The components listed are
   used as if they were a contiguous single byte aligned buffer in the
   order given.

      URL

          The first SLP SPI is the SLP SPI in the Authentication
          Block.  This SLP SPI indicates the keying material and other
          parameters to use to verify the DAAdvert.  The SLP SPI List is

[9.2.2](#section-9.2.2) DSA with SHA-1 in Authentication Blocks

   BSD=0x0002 is defined to be DSA with SHA-1.  The signature
   calculation is defined by [[20](#ref-20)].  The signature format conforms to
   that in the X.509 v3 certificate:

    1. The signature algorithm identifier (an OID)
    2. The signature value (an octet string)
    3. The certificate path.

   All data is represented in ASN.1 encoding:

        id-dsa-with-sha1 ID  ::=  {
                        iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) x9-57 (10040)
                        x9cm(4) 3 }

   i.e., the ASN.1 encoding of 1.2.840.10040.4.3 followed immediately
   by:

        Dss-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
                        r       INTEGER,
                        s       INTEGER  }

   i.e., the binary ASN.1 encoding of r and s computed using DSA and
   SHA-1.  This is followed by a certificate path, as defined by X.509
   [[10](#ref-10)], [[2](#ref-2)], [[3](#ref-3)], [[4](#ref-4)], [[5](#ref-5)].

   Authentication Blocks for BSD=0x0002 have the following format.  In
   the future, BSDs may be assigned which have different formats.

      0                   1                   2                   3

[9.3](#section-9.3). Incremental Service Registration

   Incremental registrations update attribute values for a previously
   registered service.  Incremental service registrations are useful
   when only a single attribute has changed, for instance.  In an
   incremental registration, the FRESH flag in the SrvReg header is NOT
   set.

   The new registration's attributes replace the previous
   registration's, but do not affect attributes which were included
   previously and are not present in the update.

Guttman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 30]
```

---

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   For example, suppose service:x://a.org has been registered with
   attributes A=1, B=2, C=3.  If an incremental registration comes for
   service:x://a.org with attributes C=30, D=40, then the attributes for
   the service after the update are A=1, B=2, C=30, D=40.

   Incremental registrations MUST NOT be performed for services
   registered with Authentication Blocks.  These must be registered with
   ALL attributes, with the FRESH flag in the SrvReg header set.  DAs
   which receive such registration messages return an
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED error.

   If the FRESH flag is not set and the DA does not have a prior
   registration for the service, the incremental registration fails with
   error code INVALID_UPDATE.

   The SA MUST use the same <scope-list> in an update message as was
   used in the prior registration.  If this is not done, the DA returns
   a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error.  In order to change the scope of a
   service advertisement it MUST be deregistered first and reregistered
   with a new <scope-list>.

   The SA MUST use the same <service-type> in an update message as was
   used in a prior registration of the same URL. If this is not done,
   the DA returns an INVALID_UPDATE error.

[9.4](#section-9.4). Tag Lists

   Tag lists are used in SrvDeReg and AttrReq messages.  The syntax of a
   <tag-list> item is:

   tag-filter = simple-tag / substring
   simple-tag = 1*filt-char
   substring = [initial] any [final]
   initial = 1*filt-char
     any = `*' *(filt-char `*')
   final = 1*filt-char
   filt-char = Any character excluding <reserved> and <bad-tag> (see
         grammar in [Section 5](#section-5)).

   Wild card characters in a <tag-list> item match arbitrary sequences
   of characters.  For instance "*bob*" matches "some bob I know",
   "bigbob", "bobby" and "bob".

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The <PRList> list and <scope-list> are interpreted as in [Section 8.1](#section-8.1).

   The Naming Authority string, if present in the request, will limit
   the reply to Service Type strings with the specified Naming
   Authority.  If the Naming Authority string is absent, the IANA
   registered service types will be returned.  If the length of the
   Naming Authority is set to 0xFFFF, the Naming Authority string is
   omitted and ALL Service Types are returned, regardless of Naming
   Authority.

   returned following the service type string and a `.'  character.
   Service types with the IANA Naming Authority do not include a Naming

[10.3](#section-10.3). Attribute Request

   The Attribute Request (AttrRqst) allows a UA to discover attributes
   of a given service (by supplying its URL) or for an entire service
   type.  The latter feature allows the UA to construct a query for an
   available service by selecting desired features.  The UA may request
   that all attributes are returned, or only a subset of them.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The <PRList>, <scope-list> and <SLP SPI> string are interpreted as in
   [Section 8.1](#section-8.1).

   The URL field can take two forms.  It can simply be a Service Type
   (see [Section 4.1](#section-4.1)), such as "http" or "service:tftp".  In this case,
   all attributes and the full range of values for each attribute of all
   services of the given Service Type is returned.

   The URL field may alternatively be a full URL, such as
   "service:printer:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft" or
   "nfs://max.net/znoo".  In this, only the registered attributes for
   the specified URL are returned.

   The <tag-list> field is a <string-list> of attribute tags, as defined
   in [Section 9.4](#section-9.4) which indicates the attributes to return in the
   AttrRply.  If <tag-list> is omitted, all attributes are returned.
   <tag-list> MUST be omitted and a full URL MUST be included when
   attributes when a SLP SPI List string is included, otherwise the DA
   will reply with an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED error.

   The format of the <attr-list> and the Authentication Block is as
   specified for SrvReg (see [Section 9.2.1](#section-9.2.1)).

   Attribute replies SHOULD be returned with the original case of the
   string registration intact, as they are likely to be human readable.
   In the case where the AttrRqst was by service type, all attributes
   defined for the service type, and all their values are returned.

   Although white space is folded for string matching, attribute tags
   and values MUST be returned with their original white space
   preserved.

   Only one copy of each attribute tag or String value should be
   returned, arbitrarily choosing one version (with respect to upper and
   lower case and white space internal to the strings):  Duplicate
   attributes and values SHOULD be removed.  An arbitrary version of the
   string value and tag name is chosen for the merge.  For example:
   "(A=a a,b)" merged with "(a=A   A,B)" may yield "(a=a a,B)".

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   An attribute Authentication Block is returned if an authentication
   block with the SLP SPI in the AttrRqst can be returned.  Note that
   the <attr-list> returned from a DA with an Authentication Block MUST
   be identical to the <attr-list> registered by a SA, in order for the
   authentication verification calculations to be possible.

   A SA or DA only returns an Attribute Authentication Block if the
   AttrRqst included a full URL in the request and no tag list.

   If an SLP SPI is specified in a unicast request (the REQUEST MCAST
   flag in the header is not set) and the SA or DA cannot return an
   Authentication Block with that SLP SPI, an AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN
   error is returned.  The # of Attr Auths field is set to 0 if there no
   Authentication Block is included, or 1 if an Authentication Block
   follows.

[10.6](#section-10.6). Service Deregistration

   A DA deletes a service registration when its Lifetime expires.
   Services SHOULD be deregistered when they are no longer available,
   rather than leaving the registrations to time out.

   The <scope-list> is a <string-list> (see [section 2.1](#section-2.1)).

   The SA MUST retry if there is no response from the DA, see [Section](#section-12.3)
   [12.3](#section-12.3).  The DA acknowledges a SrvDeReg with a SrvAck.  Once the SA
   receives an acknowledgment indicating success, the service and/or
   attributes are no longer advertised by the DA. The DA deregisters the
   service or service attributes from every scope specified in the
   SrvDeReg which it was previously registered in.

   The SA MUST deregister all services with the same scope list used to
   register the service with a DA. If this is not done in the SrvDeReg
   message, the DA returns a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error.  The Lifetime
   field in the URL Entry is ignored for the purposes of the SrvDeReg.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   The <tag-list> is a <string-list> of attribute tags to deregister as
   defined in [Section 9.4](#section-9.4).  If no <tag-list> is present, the SrvDeReg
   deregisters the service in all languages it has been registered in.
   If the <tag-list> is present, the SrvDeReg deregisters the attributes
   whose tags are listed in the tag spec.  Services registered with
   Authentication Blocks MUST NOT include a <tag-list> in a SrvDeReg
   message:  A DA will respond with an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED error in
   this case.

   If the service to be deregistered was registered with an
   authentication block or blocks, a URL authentication block for each
   of the SLP SPIs registered must be included in the SrvDeReg.
   Otherwise, the DA returns an AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT error.  If the
   message fails to be verified by the DA, an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
   error is returned by the DA.

[11](#section-11). Scopes

   Scopes are sets of services.  The primary use of Scopes is to provide
   the ability to create administrative groupings of services.  A set of
   services may be assigned a scope by network administrators.  A client
   seeking services is configured to use one or more scopes.  The user
   will only discover those services which have been configured for him
   or her to use.  By configuring UAs and SAs with scopes,
   administrators may provision services.  Scopes strings are case
   insensitive.  The default SCOPE string is "DEFAULT".

   Scopes are the primary means an administrator has to scale SLP
   deployments to larger networks.  When DAs with NON-DEFAULT scopes are
   present on the network, further gains can be had by configuring UAs
   and SAs to have a predefined non-default scope.  These agents can
   then perform DA discovery and make requests using their scope.  This
   will limit the number of replies.

[11.1](#section-11.1). Scope Rules

   SLP messages which fail to contain a scope that the receiving Agent
   is configured to use are dropped (if the request was multicast) or a
   SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error is returned (if the request was unicast).
   Every SrvRqst (except for DA and SA discovery requests), SrvReg,
   AttrRqst, SrvTypeRqst, DAAdvert, and SAAdvert message MUST include a
   <scope-list>.

   A UA MUST unicast its SLP messages to a DA which supports the desired
   scope, in preference to multicasting a request to SAs.  A UA MAY
   multicast the request if no DA is available in the scope it is
   configured to use.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

[11.2](#section-11.2). Administrative and User Selectable Scopes

   All requests and services are scoped.  The two exceptions are
   SrvRqsts for "service:directory-agent" and "service:service-agent".
   These MAY have a zero-length <scope-list> when used to enable the
   user to make scope selections.  In this case UAs obtain their scope
   list from DAAdverts (or if DAs are not available, from SAAdverts.)

   Otherwise, if SAs and UAs are to use any scope other than the default
   (i.e., "DEFAULT"), the UAs and SAs are configured with lists of
   scopes to use by system administrators, perhaps automatically by way
   of DHCP option 78 or 79 [[21](#ref-21)].  Such administrative scoping allows
   services to be provisioned, so that users will only see services they
   are intended to see.

   User configurable scopes allow a user to discover any service, but
   require them to do their own selection of scope.  This is similar to
   the way AppleTalk [[12](#ref-12)] and SMB [[19](#ref-19)] networking allow user selection
   of AppleTalk Zone or workgroups.

   Note that the two configuration choices are not compatible.  One
   model allows administrators control over service provision.  The
   other delegates this to users (who may not be prepared to do any
   configuration of their system).

[12](#section-12). Directory Agents

   DAs cache service location and attribute information.  They exist to
   enhance the performance and scalability of SLP. Multiple DAs provide
   further scalability and robustness of operation, since they can each
   store service information for the same SAs, in case one of the DAs
   fails.

   A DA provides a centralized store for service information.  This is
   useful in a network with several subnets or with many SLP Agents.
   The DA address can be dynamically configured with UAs and SAs using
   DHCP, or by using static configuration.

   SAs configured to use DAs with DHCP or static configuration MUST
   unicast a SrvRqst to the DA, when the SA is initialized.  The SrvRqst
   omits the scope list and sets the service type of the request to
   "service:directory-agent".  The DA will return a DAAdvert with its
   attributes, SLP SPI list, and other parameters which are essential
   for proper SA to DA communication.

   Passive detection of DAs by SAs enables services to be advertised
   consistently among DAs of the same scope.  Advertisements expire if
   not renewed, leaving only transient stale registrations in DAs, even

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   in the case of a failure of a SA.

   A single DA can support many UAs.  UAs send the same requests to DAs
   that they would send to SAs and expect the same results.  DAs reduce
   the load on SAs, making simpler implementations of SAs possible.

   UAs MUST be prepared for the possibility that the service information
   they obtain from DAs is stale.

[12.1](#section-12.1). Directory Agent Rules

   When DAs are present, each SA MUST register its services with DAs
   that support one or more of its scope(s).

   UAs MUST unicast requests directly to a DA (when scoping rules
   allow), hence avoiding using the multicast convergence algorithm, to
   obtain service information.  This decreases network utilization and
   increases the speed at which UAs can obtain service information.

   DAs MUST flush service advertisements once their lifetime expires or
   their URL Authentication Block "Timestamp" of expiration is past.

   DAAdverts MUST include DA Stateless Boot Timestamp, in the same
   format as the Authentication Block (see [Section 9.2](#section-9.2)).  The Timestamp
   in the Authentication Block indicates the time at which all previous
   registrations were lost (i.e., the last stateless reboot).  The
   Timestamp is set to 0 in a DAAdvert to notify UAs and SAs that the DA
   is going down.  DAs MUST NOT use equal or lesser Boot Timestamps to
   previous ones, if they go down and restart without service
   registration state.  This would mislead SAs to not reregister with
   the DA.

   DAs which receive a multicast SrvRqst for the service type
   "service:directory-agent" MUST silently discard it if the <scope-
   list> is (a) not omitted and (b) does not include a scope they are
   configured to use.  Otherwise the DA MUST respond with a DAAdvert.

   DAs MUST respond to AttrRqst and SrvTypeRqst messages (these are
   OPTIONAL only for SAs, not DAs.)

[12.2](#section-12.2). Directory Agent Discovery

   UAs can discover DAs using static configuration, DHCP options 78 and
   79, or by multicasting (or broadcasting) Service Requests using the
   convergence algorithm in [Section 6.3](#section-6.3).

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   See [Section 6](#section-6) regarding unsolicited DAAdverts.  [Section 12.2.2](#section-12.2.2)
   describes how SAs may reduce the number of times they must reregister
   with DAs in response to unsolicited DAAdverts.

   DAs MUST send unsolicited DAAdverts once per CONFIG_DA_BEAT. An
   unsolicited DAAdvert has an XID of 0.  SAs MUST listen for DAAdverts,
   passively, as described in [Section 8.5](#section-8.5).  UAs MAY do this.  If they do
   not listen for unsolicited DAAdverts, however, they will not discover
   DAs as they become available.  UAs SHOULD, in this case, do periodic
   active DA discovery, see [Section 6](#section-6).

   A URL with the scheme "service:directory-agent" indicates the DA's
   location as defined in [Section 8.5](#section-8.5).  For example:
   "service:directory-agent://foobawooba.org".

   The following sections suggest timing algorithms which enhance the
   scalability of SLP.

[12.2.1](#section-12.2.1). Active DA Discovery

   After a UA or SA restarts, its initial DA discovery request SHOULD be
   delayed for some random time uniformly distributed from 0 to
   CONFIG_START_WAIT seconds.

   The UA or SA sends the DA Discovery request using a SrvRqst, as
   described in [Section 8.1](#section-8.1).  DA Discovery requests MUST include a
   Previous Responder List.  SrvRqsts for Active DA Discovery SHOULD NOT
   be sent more than once per CONFIG_DA_FIND seconds.

   After discovering a new DA, a SA MUST wait a random time between 0
   and CONFIG_REG_ACTIVE seconds before registering their services.

[12.2.2](#section-12.2.2). Passive DA Advertising

   A DA MUST multicast (or broadcast) an unsolicited DAAdvert every
   CONFIG_DA_BEAT seconds.  CONFIG_DA_BEAT SHOULD be specified to
   prevent DAAdverts from using more than 1% of the available bandwidth.

   All UAs and SAs which receive the unsolicited DAAdvert SHOULD examine
   its DA stateless Boot Timestamp.  If it is set to 0, the DA is going
   down and no further messages should be sent to it.

   If a SA detects a DA it has never encountered (with a nonzero
   timestamp,) the SA must register with it.  SAs MUST examine the
   DAAdvert's timestamp to determine if the DA has had a stateless
   reboot since the SA last registered with it.  If so it registers with
   the DA. SAs MUST wait a random interval between 0 and
   CONFIG_REG_PASSIVE before beginning DA registration.

[12.3](#section-12.3). Reliable Unicast to DAs and SAs

   If a DA or SA fails to respond to a unicast UDP message in
   CONFIG_RETRY seconds, the message should be retried.  The wait
   interval for each subsequent retransmission MUST exponentially
   increase, doubling each time.  If a DA or SA fails to respond after
   CONFIG_RETRY_MAX seconds, the sender should consider the receiver to
   have gone down.  The UA should use a different DA. If no such DA
   responds, DA discovery should be used to find a new DA. If no DA is
   available, multicast requests to SAs are used.

[12.4](#section-12.4). DA Scope Configuration

   By default, DAs are configured with the "DEFAULT" scope.
   Administrators may add other configured scopes, in order to support
   UAs and SAs in non default scopes.  The default configuration MUST
   NOT be removed from the DA unless:

    -  There are other DAs which support the "DEFAULT" scope, or

    -  All UAs and SAs have been configured with non-default scopes.

   Non-default scopes can be phased-in as the SLP deployment grows.
   Default scopes should be phased out only when the non-default scopes
   are universally configured.

   If a DA and SA are coresident on a host (quite possibly implemented
   by the same process), configuration of the host is considerably
   simplified if the SA supports only scopes also supported by the DA.
   That is, the SA SHOULD NOT advertise services in any scopes which are
   not supported by the coresident DA. This means that incoming requests
   can be answered by a single data store; the SA and DA registrations
   do not need to be kept separately.

[12.5](#section-12.5). DAs and Authentication Blocks

   DAs are not configured to sign service registrations or attribute
   lists.  They simply cache services registered by Service Agents.  DAs
   MUST NOT accept registrations including authentication blocks for SLP
   SPIs which it is not configured with, see [Section 8.5](#section-8.5).

   A DA protects registrations which are made with authentication blocks
   using SLP SPIs it is configured to use.  If a service S is
   registered, a subsequent registration (which will replace the
   adertisement) or a deregistration (which will remove it) MUST include
   an Authentication Block with the corresponding SLP SPI, see [Section](#section-8.3)
   [8.3](#section-8.3) and [Section 10.6](#section-10.6).

   Example:

   A DA is configured to be able to verify Authentication Blocks with
   SLP SPIs "X,Y", that is X and Y.

   An SA registers a service with an Authentication Block with SPI "Z".
   The DA stores the registration, but discards the Authentication
   Block.  If a UA requests a service with an SLP SPI string "Z", the DA
   will respond with an AUTHENTICATION_UNKNOWN error.

   An SA registers a service S with Authentication Blocks including SLP
   SPIs "X" and "Y".  If a UA requests a service with an SLP SPI string
   "X" the DA will be able to return S (if the service type, language,
   scope and predicate of the SrvRqst match S) The DA will also return
   the Authentication Block with SLP SPI set to "X".  If the DA receives
   a subsequent SrvDeReg for S (which will remove the advertisement) or
   a subsequent SrvReg for S (which will replace it), the message must
   include two URL Authentication Blocks, one each for SPIs "X" and "Y".
   If either of these were absent, the DA would return an
   AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT error.

[14](#section-14). Optional Configuration

      Broadcast Only
               Any SLP agent SHOULD be configurable to use broadcast
               only.  See Sections [6.1](#section-6.1) and [12.2](#section-12.2).

      Predefined DA
               A UA or SA SHOULD be configurable to use a predefined DA.

      No DA Discovery
               The UA or SA SHOULD be configurable to ONLY use
               predefined and DHCP-configured DAs and perform no active
               or passive DA discovery.

      Multicast TTL
               The default multicast TTL is 255.  Agents SHOULD be
               configurable to use other values.  A lower value will
               focus the multicast convergence algorithm on smaller
               subnetworks, decreasing the number of responses and
               increases the performance of service location.  This
               may result in UAs obtaining different results for the
               identical requests depending on where they are connected
               to the network.

      Timing Values
               Time values other than the default MAY be configurable.
               See [Section 13](#section-13).

      Scopes
               A UA MAY be configurable to support User Selectable
               scopes by omitting all predefined scopes.  See
               [Section 11.2](#section-11.2).  A UA or SA MUST be configurable to use
               specific scopes by default.  Additionally, a UA or SA
               MUST be configurable to use specific scopes for requests
               for and registrations of specific service types.  The
               scope or scopes of a DA MUST be configurable.  The
               default value for a DA is to have the scope "DEFAULT" if
               not otherwise configured.

      DHCP Configuration
               DHCP options 78 and 79 may be used to configure SLP. If
               DA locations are configured using DHCP, these SHOULD
               be used in preference to DAs discovered actively or
               passively.  One or more of the scopes configured using
               DHCP MUST be used in requests.  The entire configured
               <scope-list> MUST be used in registration and DA
               configuration messages.

      Service Template
               UAs and SAs MAY be configured by using Service Templates.
               Besides simplifying the specification of attribute
               values, this also allows them to enforce the inclusion
               of 'required' attributes in SrvRqst, SrvReg and SrvDeReg
               messages.  DAs MAY be configured with templates to
               allow them to WARN UAs and SAs in these cases.  See
               [Section 10.4](#section-10.4).

      SLP SPI for service discovery
               Agents SHOULD be configurable to support SLP SPIs using
               the following parameters:  BSD=2 (DSA with SHA-1) and
               a public key identified by the SLP SPI String.  In

               SLP Agents may be able to obtain public keys and
               cryptographic parameters corresponding to the names used
               in SLP SPI Strings.

               Note that if the SLP SPI string chosen is identical
               to a scope string, it is effectively the same as a
               Protected Scope in SLPv1.  Namely, every SA advertising
               in that scope would be configured with the same Private
               Key.  Every DA and UA of that scope would be configured
               with the appropriate Public Key to verify signatures
               produced by those SAs.  This is a convenient way to
               configure SLP deployments in the absence of a Public Key
               Infrastructure.  Currently, it would be too difficult to
               manage the keying of UAs and DAs if each SA had its own
               key.

      SLP SPI for Directory Agent discovery
               Agents SHOULD be configurable to support SLP SPIs as
               above, to be used when discovering DAs.  This SPI SHOULD
               be sent in SrvRqsts to discover DAs and be used to verify
               multicast DAAdvert messages.

      SA and DA Private Key
               SAs and DAs which can generate digital signatures require
               a Private Key and a corresponding SLP SPI indentifier
               to include in the Authentication Block.  The SLP SPI
               identifies the Public Key to use to verify the digital
               signature in the Authentication Block.

[15](#section-15). IANA Considerations

   SLP includes four sets of identifiers which may be registered with
   IANA. The policies for these registrations (See [[18](#ref-18)]) are noted in
   each case.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   The Block Structure Descriptor (BSD) identifies the format of the
   Authenticator which follows.  BSDs 0x8000-0x8FFF are for Private Use.

   Further Block Structured Descriptor (BSD) values, from the range
   0x0003-0x7FFF may be standardized in the future by submitting a
   document which describes:

      -     The data format of the Structured Authenticator block.

      -     Which cryptographic algorithm to use (including a reference
            to a technical specification of the algorithm.)

      -     The format of any keying material required for
            preconfiguring UAs, DAs and SAs.  Also include any
            considerations regarding key distribution.

      -     Security considerations to alert others to the strengths and
            weaknesses of the approach.

   The IANA will assign Cryptographic BSD numbers on the basis of IETF
   Consenus.

   New function-IDs, in the range 12-255, may be standardized by the
   method of IETF Consensus.

   New SLP Extensions with types in the range 2-65535 may be registered
   following review by a Designated Expert.

   New error numbers in the range 15-65535 are assigned on the basis of
   a Standards Action.

   Protocol elements used with Service Location Protocol may also
   require IANA registration actions.  SLP is used in conjunction with
   "service:" URLs and Service Templates [[13](#ref-13)].  These are standardized
   by review of a Designated Expert and a mailing list (See [[13](#ref-13)].)

[16](#section-16). Internationalization Considerations

   SLP messages support the use of multiple languages by providing a
   Language Tag field in the common message header (see [Section 8](#section-8)).

   Services MAY be registered in multiple languages.  This provides
   attributes so that users with different language skills may select
   services interactively.

   Attribute tags are not translated.  Attribute values may be
   translated unless the Service Template [[13](#ref-13)] defines the attribute
   values to be 'literal'.

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   A service which is registered in multiple languages may be queried in
   multiple languages.  The language of the SrvRqst or AttrRqst is used
   to satisfy the request.  If the requested language is not supported,
   a LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED error is returned.  SrvRply and AttrRply
   messages are always in the same language of the request.

   A DA or SA MAY be configured with translations of Service Templates
   [[13](#ref-13)] for the same service type.  This will allow the DA or SA to
   translate a request (say in Italian) to the language of the service
   advertisement (say in English) and then translate the reply back to
   Italian.  Similarly, a UA MAY use templates to translate outgoing
   requests and incoming replies.

   The dialect field in the Language Tag MAY be used:  Requests which
   can be fulfilled by matching a language and dialect will be preferred
   to those which match only the language portion.  Otherwise, dialects
   have no effect on matching requests.

[17](#section-17). Security Considerations

   SLP provides for authentication of service URLs and service
   attributes.  This provides UAs and DAs with knowledge of the
   integrity of service URLs and attributes included in SLP messages.
   The only systems which can generate digital signatures are those
   which have been configured by administrators in advance.  Agents
   which verify signed data may assume it is 'trustworthy' inasmuch as
   administrators have ensured the cryptographic keying of SAs and DAs
   reflects 'trustworthiness.'

   Service Location does not provide confidentiality.  Because the
   objective of this protocol is to advertise services to a community of
   users, confidentiality might not generally be needed when this
   protocol is used in non-sensitive environments.  Specialized schemes
   might be able to provide confidentiality, if needed in the future.
   Sites requiring confidentiality should implement the IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) [[3](#ref-3)] to provide confidentiality for Service
   Location messages.

   If Agents are not configured to generate Authentication Blocks and
   Agents are not configured to verify them, an adversary might easily
   use this protocol to advertise services on servers controlled by the
   adversary and thereby gain access to users' private information.
   Further, an adversary using this protocol will find it much easier to
   engage in selective denial of service attacks.  Sites that are in
   potentially hostile environments (e.g., are directly connected to the
   Internet) should consider the advantages of distributing keys
   associated with SLP SPIs prior to deploying the sensitive directory
   agents or service agents.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   SLP is useful as a bootstrap protocol.  It may be used in
   environments in which no preconfiguration is possible.  In such
   situations, a certain amount of "blind faith" is required:  Without
   any prior configuration it is impossible to use any of the security
   mechanisms described above.  SLP will make use of the mechanisms
   provided by the Security Area of the IETF for key distribution as
   they become available.  At this point it would only be possible to
   gain the benefits associated with the use of Authentication Blocks if
   cryptographic information and SLP SPIs can be preconfigured with the
   end systems before they use SLP.

   SLPv2 enables a number of security policies with the mechanisms it
   includes.  A SLPv2 UA could, for instance, reject any SLP message
   which did not carry an authentication block which it could verify.
   This is not the only policy which is possible to implement.

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

[A](#appendix-A). Appendix:  Changes to the Service Location Protocol from v1 to v2

   SLP version 2 (SLPv2) corrects race conditions present in SLPv1 [[22](#ref-22)].
   In addition, authentication has been reworked to provide more
   flexibility and protection (especially for DA Advertisements).  SLPv2
   also changes the formats and definition of many flags and values and
   reduces the number of 'required features.'  SLPv2 clarifies and
   changes the use of 'Scopes', eliminating support for 'unscoped
   directory agents' and 'unscoped requests'.  SLPv2 uses LDAPv3
   compatible string encodings of attributes and search filters.  Other
   changes (such as Language and Character set handling) adopt practices
   recommended by the Internet Engineering Steering Group.

   Effort has been made to make SLPv2 operate the same whether DAs are
   present or not.  For this reason, a new message (the SAAdvert) has
   been added.  This allows UAs to discover scope information in the
   absence of administrative configuration and DAs.  This was not
   possible in SLPv1.

   SLPv2 is incompatible in some respects with SLPv1.  If a DA which
   supports both SLPv1 and SLPv2 with the same scope is present,
   services advertised by SAs using either version of the protocol will
   be available to both SLPv1 and SLPv2 UAs.  SLPv1 DAs SHOULD be phased
   out and replace with SLPv2 DAs which support both versions of the
   protocol.

   SLPv1 allows services to be advertised and requested without a scope.
   Further, DAs can be configured without a scope.  This is incompatible
   with SLPv2 and presents scalability problems.  To facilitate this
   forward migration, SLPv1 agents MUST use scopes for all registrations
   and requests.  SLPv1 DAs MUST be configured with a scope list.  This
   constitutes a revision of [RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165) [[22](#ref-22)].

[B](#appendix-B). Appendix:  Service Discovery by Type:  Minimal SLPv2 Features

   Service Agents may advertise services without attributes.  This will
   enable only discovery of services by type.  Service types discovered
   this way will have a Service Template [[13](#ref-13)] defined which specifies
   explicitly that no attributes are associated with the service
   advertisement.  Service types associated with Service Templates which
   specify attributes MUST NOT be advertised by SAs which do not support
   attributes.

   While discovery of service by service type is a subset of the
   features possible using SLPv2 this form of discovery is consistent
   with the current generation of products that allow simple browsing of
   all services in a 'zone' or 'workgroup' by type.  In some cases,
   attribute discovery, security and feature negotiation is handled by

Guttman, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 48]

```

[RFC 2608](/doc/html/rfc2608)         Service Location Protocol, Version 2          June 1999

   application layer protocols - all that is required is the basic
   discovery of services that support a certain service.

   UAs requesting only service of that service type would only need to
   support service type and scope fields of the Service Request.  UAs
   would still perform DA discovery and unicast SLPv2 SrvRqst messages
   to DAs in their scope once they were discovered instead of
   multicasting them.

   SAs would also perform DA discovery and use a SLPv2 SrvReg to
   register all their advertised services with SLPv2 DAs in their scope.
   These advertisements would needless to say contain no attribute
   string.

   These minimal SAs could ignore the Language Tag in requests since
   SrvRqst messages would contain no attributes, hence no strings would
   be internationalized.  Further, any non-null predicate string would
   fail to match a service advertisement with no attributes, so these
   SAs would not have to parse and interpret search filters.  Overflow
   will never occur in SrvRqst, SrvRply or SrvReg messages so TCP
   message handling would not have to be implemented.  Finally, all
   AttrRqst messages could be dropped by the SA, since no attributes are
   supported.

[C](#appendix-C). Appendix:  DAAdverts with arbitrary URLs

   Using Active DA Discovery, a SrvRqst with its service type field set
   to "service:directory-agent".  DAs will respond with a DAAdvert
   containing a URL with the "service:directory-agent:" scheme.  This is
   the same DAAdvert that such a DA would multicast in unsolicited DA
   advertisements.

   A UA or SA which receives an unsolicited DAAdvert MUST examine the
   URL to determine if it has a recognized scheme.  If the UA or SA does
   not recognize the DAAdvert's URL scheme, the DAAdvert is silently
   discarded.  This document specifies only how to use URLs with the
   "service:directory-agent:" scheme.

   This provides the possibility for forward compatibility with future
   versions of SLP and enables other services to advertise their ability
   to serve as a clearinghouse for service location information.

   For example, if LDAPv3 [[15](#ref-15)] is used for service registration and
   discovery by a set of end systems, they could interpret a LDAP URL
   [[16](#ref-16)] to passively discover the LDAP server to use for this purpose.
   This document does not specify how this is done:  SLPv2 agents
   without further support would simply discard this DAAdvert.

   Required attributes and the format of the IDVer string are defined by
   [[13](#ref-13)].

   If a SA or DA receives a SrvRqst or a SrvReg which fails to include a
   Required Attribute for the requested Service Type (according to the
   Service Template), it MAY return the Required Attribute Extension in
   addition to the reply corresponding to the message.  The sender
   SHOULD reissue the message with a search filter including the
   attributes listed in the returned Required Attribute Extension.
   Similarly, the Required Attribute Extension may be returned in
   response to a SrvDereg message that contains a required attribute
   tag.

   The Template IDVer String is the name and version number string of
   the Service Template which defines the given attribute as required.
   It SHOULD be included, but can be omitted if a given SA or DA has
   been individually configured to have 'required attributes.'

   The Required Attribute <tag-list> MUST NOT include wild cards.

**Editor's Note: On November 8, 2023, CISA added CVE-2023-29552 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities [list](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).**

Researchers from Bitsight and Curesec have jointly discovered a high-severity vulnerability — tracked as CVE-2023-29552 — in the Service Location Protocol (SLP), a legacy Internet protocol. **Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could leverage vulnerable instances to launch massive Denial-of-Service (DoS) amplification attacks with a factor as high as 2200 times, potentially making it one of the largest amplification attacks ever reported**. In February 2023, we identified over 2,000 global organizations and over 54,000 SLP instances — including VMware ESXi Hypervisor, Konica Minolta printers, Planex Routers, IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM), SMC IPMI, and others — that attackers could potentially leverage to launch DoS attacks on unsuspecting organizations around the world.

Given the criticality of the vulnerability and the potential consequences resulting from exploitation, Bitsight coordinated public disclosure efforts with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and impacted organizations. Bitsight also engaged with denial of service teams at major IT service management companies to help with remediation. CISA conducted extensive outreach to potentially impacted vendors.

* Technical details regarding CVE-2023-29552 are available [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29552).
* The CISA Current Activity Alert is available [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/04/25/abuse-service-location-protocol-may-lead-dos-attacks).

![SLP Blog BitSight and CISA Logo](/sites/default/files/2023/04/21/Bitsight%20and%20CISA%20logos.png)

## What is the Service Location Protocol (SLP)?

SLP is a protocol that was created in 1997 through [RFC 2165](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2165.html) to provide a dynamic configuration mechanism for applications in local area networks. SLP allows systems on a network to find each other and communicate with each other. It does this by using a directory of available services, which can include things like printers, file servers, and other network resources. SLP works by having a system register itself with a directory agent, which then makes that system's services available to other systems on the network. Daemons providing SLP are bound to the default port 427, both UDP and TCP.

SLP was not intended to be made available to the public Internet. According to RFC 2165, "Service Location provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for applications in local area networks. It is not a global resolution system for the entire Internet; rather, it is intended to serve enterprise networks with shared services." However, the protocol has been found in a variety of instances connected to the Internet. A recent internet-wide scan revealed more than 54,000 SLP-speaking instances online, belonging to organizations across many sectors and geographies.

![SLP Blog 54000 SLP Speaking systems online](/sites/default/files/2023/04/21/vulnerable%20IPs%20by%20Sector.png)

Researchers have identified security vulnerabilities affecting implementations of SLP for many years. VMware has issued [multiple advisories](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/76372) warning users about vulnerabilities affecting SLP in their ESXi products and disabled SLP by default in ESXi software releases since 2021. In recent months, ransomware gangs have leveraged an [issue](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-esxiargs-ransomware-attack-targets-vmware-esxi-servers-worldwide/) in SLP implementations in campaigns targeting vulnerable organizations. In February 2023, VMware [warned](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vmware-warns-admins-to-patch-esxi-servers-disable-openslp-service/) customers to install the latest security updates and disable OpenSLP service because it was being targeted in a large-scale campaign of ransomware attacks against internet-exposed and vulnerable ESXi servers.

## What vulnerability was discovered?

Researchers from Bitsight and Curesec jointly discovered CVE-2023-29552 (CVSS 7.5). If exploited, CVE-2023-29552 allows an attacker to leverage vulnerable instances to launch a DoS attack — sending massive amounts of traffic to a victim — via a reflection amplification attack.

DoS attacks have made headlines in recent years, causing significant financial, reputational, and operational harm. With attacks [predicted](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html) to double from 2018 to the end of 2023, organizations continue to fall victim to service disruptions. In fact, small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) [spend](https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-research/kaspersky-lab-study-average-cost-of-enterprise-ddos-attack-totals-2m/) an average of $120,000 as a result of a DoS attack, while larger organizations may face larger financial losses due to relatively higher costs of disruption. Large, multinational enterprises are not immune to these attacks – Amazon Web Services (AWS), GitHub, and even nation states have [fallen victim](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/famous-ddos-attacks/) to DoS attacks.

### How does a typical reflection DoS amplification attack work?

In a typical reflection DoS amplification attack, the attacker usually sends small requests to a server with a spoofed source IP address that corresponds to the victim's IP address. The server then replies to the victim's IP address, sending much larger responses than the requests, generating large amounts of traffic to the victim’s system. The attacker is simply tricking systems on the Internet — not necessarily owned by the target — to send mass amounts of traffic to the target.

### What does a reflection DoS amplification attack leveraging CVE-2023-29552 look like?

Reflection coupled with service registration significantly amplifies the amount of traffic sent to the victim. The typical reply packet size from an SLP server is between 48 and 350 bytes. Assuming a 29 byte request, the amplification factor — or the ratio of reply to request magnitudes — is roughly between 1.6X and 12X in this situation. However, SLP allows an unauthenticated user to register arbitrary new services, meaning an attacker can manipulate both the content and the size of the server reply, resulting in a maximum amplification factor of over 2200X due to the roughly 65,000 byte response given a 29 byte request. This extremely high amplification factor allows for an under-resourced threat actor to have a significant impact on a targeted network and/or server via a reflection DoS amplification attack.

#### Typical reflection DoS amplification attack:

* Step 1: The attacker finds an SLP server on UDP port 427.
* Step 2: The attacker spoofs a request to that service with the victim's IP as the origin.
* Step 3: The attacker repeats step two as long as the attack is ongoing.

Client request:

![SLP Blog client request image](/sites/default/files/2023/04/21/client%20request.png)

Server reply:

![SLP Blog server request image](/sites/default/files/2023/04/21/Server-reply.png)

During this attack, the requests made and the response differ in size. The bigger the response in relation to the request, the higher the amplification factor. With SLP, it is possible to forge Service Type Request messages, requesting all naming authorities and the default scope. This makes the server reply with all service type lists it provides.

Amplification factor: between 1.6X and 12X.

#### Reflection DoS amplification attack leveraging CVE-2023-29552:

* Step 1: The attacker finds an SLP server on UDP port 427.
* Step 2: The attacker registers services until SLP denies more entries..
* Step 3: The attacker spoofs a request to that service with the victim's IP as the origin.
* Step 4: The attacker repeats step three as long as the attack is ongoing.

The setup phase of the attack only needs to happen once to fill the server response buffer. The attacker can manipulate both the content and size of the server reply by registering arbitrary new services. During the attack, the interaction between the attacker and the server would look like a service registration loop until the server buffer is full, followed by arbitrary spoofed requests.

Below is the Wireshark log capturing the complete communication between an attacker and a server, where the attacker is attempting to fill the response buffer. The registration requests are highlighted in green, and the server replies are highlighted in red. As each request is made, it is important to observe that the reassembled UDP packets are increasing in size. Depending on the software and/or system being used, the size of the reply can potentially reach the practical limit of a single UDP packet, which is typically 65,536 bytes.

![wireshark log CVE-2023-29552 complete communication capture](/sites/default/files/2023/04/24/wireshark%20log%20CVE-2023-29552%20complete%20communication%20capture.png)

Amplification factor: maximum of approximately 2200X. By comparison, the 2020 DoS attack on AWS was executed with a similar reflection amplification attack using CLDAP, relying on a maximum amplification factor of 55X.

To see the amplification in action, see the video below:

### What products are affected?

CVE-2023-29552 affects all SLP implementations tested by Bitsight and Curesec. We detected more than 54,000 SLP-speaking instances and more than 670 different product types, including VMware ESXi Hypervisor, Konica Minolta printers, Planex Routers, IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM), SMC IPMI, and many others.

There are many SLP speaking instances which makes it a challenge to exhaustively fingerprint all instances affected by the issue. There are some SLP implementations that do not allow for registration of new services, leaving the amplification factor to a smaller fixed value. However, most of the implementations that we have seen and tested do allow and are vulnerable to registration of spoofed services, thus enabling the massive 2200X amplification factor.

## Organizational impact is broad

Over 2,000 organizations were identified as having vulnerable instances. Attackers could potentially leverage these vulnerable instances to launch a DoS attack targeting the system owners and/or other organizations.

The top 10 countries with the most organizations having vulnerable instances are:

![SLP Blog Service Location Protocol Vuln By Country](/sites/default/files/2023/04/21/Service%20Location%20Protocol%20Vuln%20By%20Country.png)

### Fortune 1000 organizations with vulnerable instances

Many Fortune 1000 organizations were identified as having vulnerable instances. Fortune 1000 impact spans many sectors, including finance, insurance, technology, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, and transportation.

## How to protect against CVE-2023-29552

To protect against CVE-2023-29552, **SLP should be disabled on all systems running on untrusted networks, like those directly connected to the Internet**. If that is not possible, then firewalls should be configured to filter traffic on UDP and TCP port 427. This will prevent external attackers from accessing the SLP service.

### Take action now

CVE-2023-29552 is a threat that can potentially impact business continuity and result in financial loss, even if an attacker has limited resources. Organizations must implement appropriate security measures to safeguard their networks and servers from being used in such attacks. One effective way to protect against SLP vulnerabilities is by implementing robust network security controls such as firewalls.

It is equally important to enforce strong authentication and access controls, allowing only authorized users to access the correct network resources, with access being closely monitored and audited. Organizations should also have an [incident response](/blog/5-steps-creating-incident-response-plan) plan in place that clearly outlines procedures for mitigating SLP vulnerabilities, as well as procedures for communicating with users and stakeholders in case of an incident.

Implementing strong security measures and access controls can reduce the risk of falling victim or unwillingly participating in these types of attacks, while incident response plans can mitigate the effects of such an attack.

Ampliﬁcation Hell: Revisiting
Network Protocols for DDoS Abuse

Christian Rossow

{ﬁrstname.lastname}@rub.de

Abstract—In distributed reﬂective denial-of-service (DRDoS)
attacks, adversaries send requests to public servers (e.g., open
recursive DNS resolvers) and spoof the IP address of a victim.
These servers,
in turn, ﬂood the victim with valid responses
and – unknowingly – exhaust its bandwidth. Recently, attackers
launched DRDoS attacks with hundreds of Gb/s bandwidth of this
kind. While the attack technique is well-known for a few protocols
such as DNS, it is unclear if further protocols are vulnerable to
similar or worse attacks.

In this paper, we revisit popular UDP-based protocols of
network services, online games, P2P ﬁlesharing networks and
P2P botnets to assess their security against DRDoS abuse. We
ﬁnd that 14 protocols are susceptible to bandwidth ampliﬁcation
and multiply the trafﬁc up to a factor 4670. In the worst case,
attackers thus need only 0.02% of the bandwidth that they want
their victim(s) to receive, enabling far more dangerous attacks
than what is known today. Worse, we identify millions of public
hosts that can be abused as ampliﬁers.

We then analyze more than 130 real-world DRDoS attacks.
For this, we announce bait services to monitor their abuse and
analyze darknet as well as network trafﬁc from large ISPs. We
use trafﬁc analysis to detect both, victims and ampliﬁers, showing
that attackers already started to abuse vulnerable protocols other
than DNS. Lastly, we evaluate countermeasures against DRDoS
attacks, such as preventing spooﬁng or hardening protocols and
service conﬁgurations. We shows that carefully-crafted DRDoS
attacks may evade poorly-designed rate limiting solutions. In
addition, we show that some attacks evade packet-based ﬁltering
techniques, such as port-, content- or length-based ﬁlters.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, an attacker with ﬁnan-
cial, political or purely destructive motivation disrupts a service
of a victim by adding an excessively high load to the victim’s
service(s). There are several forms of DoS attacks [30, 18],
most of which are well-documented and used by attackers to
disturb services for years. For example, attackers target victims
with distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks and instruct infected PCs
that are part of a malicious botnets [4]. Similarly, attackers
can exhaust application-layer resources, such as the maximum
number of database sessions of a web application [30].

In distributed reﬂective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks,
an adversary aims to exhaust
the victim’s bandwidth. He
abuses the fact that public servers of UDP-based network
protocols respond to requests without further validating the
identity (i.e., the IP address) of the sender. DRDoS offers many
desired attack features for an adversary: (i) He disguises his
identity, as victims receive backscatter trafﬁc from ampliﬁers,
i.e., systems that can be abused to send trafﬁc to the victim on
the attacker’s behalf; (ii) The simultaneous abuse of multiple
ampliﬁers permits a highly-distributed DoS attack to be con-
ducted from a single Internet uplink. (iii) The trafﬁc reﬂected
to the victim is signiﬁcantly larger in bandwidth than the trafﬁc
an attacker has to send to the ampliﬁers.

Adversaries abused the high potential of massive DRDoS
attacks recently. In May 2012, attackers targeted a real-time
ﬁnancial exchange platform with a 167 Gb/s DRDoS at-
tack [15]. In March 2013, attackers launched 300 Gb/s DRDoS
attack against Spamhaus.org [16]. In August 2013, presumably
politically-motivated attackers brought down GreenNet, an
ISP hosting human rights groups, with a 100 Gb/s DRDoS
attack [36]. In these known examples, attackers abused open
DNS resolvers to amplify their attack trafﬁc. The attacker(s)
issued specially-crafted ANY requests to thousands of open
resolvers and speciﬁed the victim’s IP address as packet
source. In turn, after successful name resolution, the resolvers
sent several-kilobyte-large responses to the victim, exceeding
its bandwidth capacity. With these attacks, DNS has been
practically proven to be vulnerable to DRDoS abuse. One of
the reasons for this vulnerability are the recent deployment
of EDNS0 and DNSSEC, which signiﬁcantly increases the
DNS response sizes [5]. As a consequence, developers and
administrators increasingly harden DNS servers against abuse,
e.g., by closing millions of open resolvers and limiting the
request rate per client [38]. However, DNS is not the only
widely-deployed service, and little is known about angles for
ampliﬁcation of other popular network protocols.

In this paper, we revisit UDP-based network protocols and
evaluate if they are vulnerable to ampliﬁcation attacks. We
identify and describe ampliﬁcation vectors in 14 protocols of
various services, including network services (such as NTP,
SNMP, SSDP and NetBios), legacy services (CharGen and
QOTD), peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁlesharing networks (BitTorrent
and Kad), game servers (Quake 3 and Steam) and P2P-
based botnets. Many of these protocols have been designed
decades ago way before DRDoS attacks emerged. As we
show, attackers can abuse these protocols to multiply their
attack bandwidth by factors from 3.8 (BitTorrent, NetBios)

II. THREAT MODEL

Our threat model are distributed and reﬂective denial-of-
service (DRDoS) attacks, in which an attacker A aims to con-
sume all available bandwidth of a victim V . Reﬂective means
that A does not directly send trafﬁc to V , but instead uses
systems that reﬂect the attack trafﬁc to V (so called ampliﬁers).
Distributed accounts for the fact that A abuses thousands of
ampliﬁers and V thus faces thousands of attack sources. The
victim V is any Internet-connected host (i.e., server or client)
with a single uplink, usually (but not necessarily) identiﬁed by
a single IPv4 address.

A controls an Internet gateway that can send IP packets
with spoofed source addresses. This assumption is reasonable
despite the fact that IP spooﬁng is considered a bad habit and is
discouraged [21]. As of July 2013, the Spoofer Project listed
that 25% of the Autonomous Systems world-wide allow IP
spooﬁng [1]. Our threat model becomes more severe the higher
the bandwidth available to A, but we do not make assumptions
about the bandwidth an attacker can use.

A further knows at least one UDP-based protocol P for
which he can craft requests that a server (a potential ampliﬁer)
for P will answer. We assume that A can obtain a set of
ampliﬁers (MP ) that respond to valid requests of protocol
P . As we will show, obtaining MP is typically not a high
burden to attackers, as attackers can easily understand most
network protocols by reading public documentation or open
source code. In this work, we focus on protocols for which the
responses are larger than the requests. Attacks become worse
the higher this imbalance is, as A can then actually amplify
(and not only reﬂect) its trafﬁc.

We further restrict A such that he cannot control or
conﬁgure the ampliﬁers in any way, i.e., he can only use
services offered to anybody. To be speciﬁc, for the P2P botnets
we analyze, A can not command the bots.

up to 4670 (NTP). In combination with source IP address
spooﬁng, this adds severe loads to designated DRDoS victims.
For each protocol, we explore the set of potential ampliﬁers,
for example, by scanning the Internet for open services, by
crawling P2P networks, or by requesting game server lists from
master servers. We show that millions of potential ampliﬁers
are available for six vulnerable protocols – ideal for attackers
that aim to distribute attacks over many trafﬁc sources.

We then use a three-fold approach to understand if attackers
abuse these vulnerable protocols. (i) We deploy bait services
for these protocols and monitor how they are abused by attack-
ers. (ii) We analyze if attackers scan for potential ampliﬁers
by looking at the scanning noise of two darknets. (iii) We
propose a light-weight method to detect DRDoS attacks via
trafﬁc analysis and deploy it at a large ISP. Our evaluation of
more than 130 real-world DRDoS attacks shows that DNS is
still the most popular DRDoS protocol, but we also already
witnessed attacks abusing CharGen, SNMP and Quake 3.

Fearing that adversaries will soon discover other powerful
ampliﬁcation vectors like NTP or SSDP, we describe and
evaluate countermeasures. We show that for some of the
protocols, existing attack detection techniques, such as port-,
content- or length-based ﬁltering approaches will fail, as none
of these attributes is characteristic in the attack trafﬁc. In ad-
dition, we show that request rate limiting does not sufﬁciently
protect against carefully-crafted DRDoS attacks that abuse
millions of ampliﬁers. To foster security of future protocols
and their implementations, we also discuss how protocols can
be hardened and give positive examples that are presumably
immune to DRDoS attacks.

The following list summarizes our contributions:

1) We discover that 14 network protocols can be abused
to launch DRDoS attacks that amplify the attack
trafﬁc by the order of up to three magnitudes. We
found thousands, and for six protocols even millions
of ampliﬁers, allowing for highly distributed attacks.

2) We propose methods to detect real-world DRDoS
attacks, such as bait services that are monitored for
abuse and using trafﬁc analysis to identify DRDoS
victims and ampliﬁers. We analyze more than 130
real-world attacks, showing that DRDoS attacks
bother network operators on a daily basis.

3) We describe and evaluate DRDoS countermeasures
and discuss methods (not) to use to harden network
protocols and vulnerable implementations.

Fig. 1: Our threat model: An attacker sends requests to ampliﬁers with
the victim’s IP address as IP packet source. In turn, the ampliﬁers send
(potentially multiple) large responses to the victim.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we describe our threat model. In Section III, we show
popular network protocols that are vulnerable to ampliﬁcation.
We search for real-world attacks abusing these protocols in
Section IV. We evaluate countermeasues in Section V, discuss
our ﬁndings and future work in Section VII and conclude our
work in Section VIII.

Figure 1 illustrates our threat model. A sends small requests
to three heterogeneous ampliﬁers that all run services that
are vulnerable to an ampliﬁcation attack. A speciﬁes V ’s IP
address as source for the request sent to MP , causing the
ampliﬁers to send their responses to V — although V never
asked for it. In case of ampliﬁcation vulnerabilities in P , MP
typically sends responses which are signiﬁcantly larger than
the requests, causing bandwidth congestion at V .

VictimAttackerAmplifiersOther types of DDoS attacks are outside the scope of this
work, such as exhausting TCP connections or slowing down
application-layer services. Note that we focus on IPv4 only,
but our results should be similar in IPv6 networks.

To summarize, our threat model represents a typical setting
of underground DDoS services. In fact, the most severe DR-
DoS attacks so far followed exactly this setting [16, 15, 36].
In this work, we seek to understand if we can expect similar
or even worse attacks in the future.

III. AMPLIFICATION VULNERABILITIES

In DRDoS attacks, two main factors determine the impact
of an attack. First, attackers strive to abuse network proto-
cols that not only reﬂect trafﬁc, but that also amplify the
attack bandwidth. Second, the number of ampliﬁers and their
aggregated attack bandwidth constrains the bandwidth of an
DRDoS attack. In this section, we show which popular network
protocols are attractive to attackers in this regard.

A. Protocol Overview

One of the key characteristics of DRDoS attacks is that
attackers abuse network protocols in which i) small requests
lead to relatively large responses and ii) where reﬂection of
trafﬁc with spoofed IP source addresses is possible due to the
lack of a proper handshake. As such, we exclude all TCP-
based protocols from our analysis, as IP address spooﬁng is
restricted to the start of the TCP handshake. Although the TCP
handshake fulﬁls the reﬂection criterion, it does not allow for
easy ampliﬁcation (since a TCP ACK is not larger than a TCP
SYN packet). However, we show that 14 popular UDP-based
network protocols are suitable candidates for DRDoS attacks.

TABLE I: Overview of the analyzed network protocols grouped into
ﬁve categories: network services, legacy protocols, P2P ﬁle sharing,
multiplayer games and P2P-based botnets. The Port(s) column de-
scribes the typical UDP listening port for the service or speciﬁes any
if ports are chosen randomly.

Table I categorizes the 14 protocols that we analyzed into
ﬁve groups. The ﬁrst group consists of popular protocols used
for network services, such as time synchronization, host dis-
covery or device monitoring. We added two legacy protocols,
Character Generation (CharGen, RFC 864) and Quote of the
Day (QOTD, RFC 865), to the second group. The third group
comprises two protocols of P2P-based ﬁle sharing networks. In
group four, we added two game server engines that are used for
various game implementations. In the last group, we explore

3

how P2P-based botnets [26] can be abused for DRDoS attacks,
i.e., even for somebody not being the botmaster. This non-
exhaustive list represents the protocols that we found are most
relevant for our analysis. We excluded a few protocols from
our analysis for which we did not ﬁnd ampliﬁcation vectors,
such as the ECHO and ISAKMP protocols – these protocols
do, however, allow non-ampliﬁed trafﬁc reﬂection attacks.

B. Ampliﬁer Enumeration

In this section, we enumerate the ampliﬁers per protocol,
i.e., the set of public hosts that may be abused for ampliﬁcation
attacks. In case of DNS, dedicated projects already track the
number of open resolvers that could be used to launch DRDoS
attacks using DNS. However, for the majority of the other
protocols,
the number of potential ampliﬁers is unknown.
The more ampliﬁers are available, the harder it becomes to
identify or alert attack sources and the higher is the maximum
attack bandwidth. We use three techniques to enumerate the
ampliﬁers for the 14 analyzed protocols: scanning, crawling
and querying master servers.

For network services, we assume that they run on their
standardized UDP port and we scan the Internet for available
ampliﬁers. To save resources and limit the noise of our scans,
we scan a random sample of 106 IP addresses out of the set of
all 2.6 billion advertized IPv4 addresses. We then extrapolate
the total number of ampliﬁers from the number of ampliﬁers
found during our partial scan. In our experiments, we used a
synchronous 150 MBit/s Internet connection for scanning, and
each scan ﬁnished in 65 seconds on average. Implementing
an optimized and complete scanner is out of the scope of this
work. As shown by Durumeric et al. [8], an attacker could
speed up this process and complete a /0 IPv4 scan for one
protocol in less than two hours by using a 1 Gb/s uplink and
a more efﬁcient scanner implementation. Similarly, Dainotti et
al. observed botnets that complete /0 stealthy scans [6]. This
shows that, in practice, scanning is no burden to attackers.

In the case of P2P protocols (both malicious and benign
networks), we enumerate the ampliﬁers by an iterative search
through peer list exchanges, a process often referred to as
crawling. Crawling requires detailed knowledge about the P2P
protocols and message structures. If available, we studied the
source code of popular protocol implementations (e.g., eMule
for Kad or libtorrent for BitTorrent), or manually reverse
engineered protocol implementations otherwise (e.g., for the
P2P-based bots). We obtained an initial set of ten bootstrapping
peers from public resources or the protocol implementations.
We then iteratively query the set of known peers to retrieve
their neighboring peers. Such peer list exchanges are an inher-
ent protocol feature of all P2P networks. Note that crawling
typically only identiﬁes Internet-facing peers, which is exactly
the set of ampliﬁers we are interested in. That is, we include
only peers that at least once responded to our requests, by
which we exclude all peers behind a ﬁrewall or NAT gateway.

In order to cope with the effects of IP address churn, we
terminated the crawling process after one hour. For a detailed
description of our crawler implementation we refer to our
crawling scheme described in our work on measuring the size
of P2P-based botnets [26]. Given that we terminated our crawls
after one our, we hypothesize that our P2P crawling results rep-
resent lower bounds for the actual number of ampliﬁers. This

would follow our detailed analysis of P2P botnet crawls [26].
We conﬁrmed this hypothesis by observing that our crawler
was still learning new peers (identiﬁed by previously unseen
identiﬁers, if available) when terminating the process.

Lastly, for the game server protocols, we leverage the fact
that game servers register at a master server, which we query
to obtain a list of available game servers. Although typical,
registration at the master server is not mandatory, i.e., the
number of actual game servers is probably slightly higher than
the set of servers obtained from the master server. We validated
the retrieved server lists by cross-checking them with the set
of servers displayed in-game and with online game server
browsers. We also included game servers that are password-
protected, as password protection in this case is irrelevant for
the scenario that we will describe.

In the speciﬁc case of DNS, we measure two types of
ampliﬁers. First, we scan the Internet for open resolvers, i.e.,
public resolvers that serve recursive name lookups to any
client. Again, as this is not important for our threat model,
we also include resolvers that returned incorrect resource
records [27]. Second, we give lower bounds for the number
of authoritative name servers. We cannot scan for authoritative
name servers, though, as we do not know the zones a server is
authoritative for. However, an attacker can crawl the Internet
(e.g., web sites) for domains and then determine the author-
itative name servers for these domains. Instead of crawling
ourselves, we use the public dataset of the Common Crawl
project1. We then recursively resolve each domain name and
track all authoritative name servers.

We performed the measurements during weekdays between
1pm and 3pm GMT. Table II shows our results per protocol.
We rounded the numbers for the scanning measurements to
indicate that accuracy is lost by extrapolating the scanning
results. While open DNS resolvers rank highest, also SSDP,
NTP, NetBios, SNMP and BitTorrent reveal millions of po-
tential ampliﬁers. Of the 255,819 authoritative DNS name
servers, we found that at least 1404 deploy DNSSEC. The
two legacy protocols, CharGen and QOTD, offer signiﬁcantly
fewer ampliﬁers. For the P2P networks, we ignore all peers that
cannot be abused as ampliﬁers, e.g., because they are behind
a NAT gateway or ﬁrewalled, and crawled for an hour only.
The numbers are thus a subset of all peers in a network, which
also explains the difference to previous measurements on P2P
botnet sizes [26]. Still, the P2P networks span thousands, and
BitTorrent even millions of potential ampliﬁers.

Lastly, we measured how long it takes for an attacker to
obtain 1000 and 100,000 ampliﬁers per protocol, respectively.
For scanning, we assume that a /0 scan for a UDP-based
protocol ﬁnishes in two hours [8] and calculate the time to
ﬁnd a subset of ampliﬁers accordingly. For the P2P networks
we measure when – relative to the time when starting a crawl
– a peer responds to us the ﬁrst time.

Table II shows that the time needed to acquire a reasonable
number of ampliﬁers is negligible in most protocols. For
example, it takes about a minute to acquire 100,000 BitTor-
rent ampliﬁers, and scanning for the same number of hosts
completes in less than four minutes for SNMP, NTP, DNSOR

or SSDP. Only for protocols with fewer ampliﬁers, such as
QOTD or CharGen, even ﬁnding a small subset of ampliﬁers
takes several minutes. Moreover, for DNSNS, crawling the web
for domains (a step we omitted) and recursively resolving the
domains takes hours. However, overall, this shows that attack-
ers can assemble a set of recent ampliﬁers as a preparation for
a DRDoS attack in no time.

C. Ampliﬁcation Factors

In this section, we evaluate the potential ampliﬁcation fac-
tors of the 14 protocols in Table I. In a ﬁrst step, we analyzed
each of the protocols to ﬁnd potential vectors of ampliﬁcation.
For the network service protocols, we studied the respective
RFC documents and popular open source implementations. We
dissected the two P2P ﬁle sharing protocols by examining
several open source client implementations, such as eMule,
libtorrent or Vuze. For the game servers, we found possible
attack vectors in the public API documentation provided by
the game vendors. Lastly, we reverse-engineered the network
protocols of the three bot binaries to understand the encryption
schemes and different request types of the proprietary P2P
protocols.

As a measure for ampliﬁcation, we deﬁne the bandwidth
ampliﬁcation factor (BAF) as the bandwidth multiplier in
terms of number of UDP payload bytes that an ampliﬁer sends
to answer a request, compared to the number of UDP payload
bytes of the request, i.e.:

BAF =

len(U DP payload) ampliﬁer to victim
len(U DP payload) attacker to ampliﬁer

(1)

We chose not to include Ethernet, IP, or UDP headers in this
calculation so that our measurements remain valid even if the
upper protocol layers change in the future, such as during the
migration from IPv4 to IPv6.

In addition, we measure the packet ampliﬁcation factor
(PAF) as the packet multiplier in terms of number of IP packets
that an ampliﬁer sends to answer a request. More formally, we
deﬁne the PAF as:

P AF =

number of packets ampliﬁer to victim
number of packets attacker to ampliﬁer

TABLE III: Bandwidth ampliﬁer factors per protocols. all shows the
average BAF of all ampliﬁers, 50% and 10% show the average BAF
when using the worst 50% or 10% of the ampliﬁers, respectively.

For each protocol, we aim to identify the request-response
scenario with the highest bandwidth ampliﬁcation factor. We
then send the corresponding request to all ampliﬁers that we
identify in Section III-B and measure the average response
size. While the BAF mainly depends on the protocol, it also
depends on the speciﬁc ampliﬁer instance and its protocol
implementation. In fact, an attacker can ﬁrst measure the
BAF per ampliﬁer and – in the actual attack – use only the
subset of ampliﬁers with the highest BAFs. We thus also
included two further BAF measures that show the BAF if the
attacker focuses on abusing the most severe 50% or 10% of
the ampliﬁers, respectively. Table III summarizes our results.
The PAF in Table III shows the PAF that we measured when
using all (and not a subset of) ampliﬁers.

In the following, we will describe the maximum ampliﬁ-

cation scenarios and our measurement results per protocol:

1) SNMP v2: We found that SNMP v22 supports the
GetBulk operation, in which a device returns a list of SNMP
identiﬁers that can be monitored. In the legitimate use case, this
request can be used to iterate all monitoring values. An attacker
can abuse this feature to amplify trafﬁc by factor 6.3. The
exact response size is determined by the number and length of
identiﬁers in the returned item list. If an attacker abuses only
the 10% subset of the ampliﬁers that reply with the largest
payload, the BAF increases to 11.3.

2) NTP: We found that NTP servers support the monlist
request, which most NTP server implementations accept in
its short form of only 8 bytes. Upon receiving a monlist
request, an NTP server shares its recent clients in up to 100
UDP datagrams with 440 bytes payload each. One response
datagram speciﬁes statistics for NTP clients (such as the
client’s IP address, its NTP version and the number of requests)
who contacted this NTP server – a useful debugging feature
in the legitimate use case. The total response length depends
on the number client statistics a server shares upon request.
On average, monlist requests amplify the request trafﬁc by
factor 556.9–4670.0, the highest BAF in our measurements.

Next to monlist, NTP servers support further features

2We focus on SNMP in version 2 as it is the most popular version and

supported by the majority of SNMP devices.

that may be abused for attacks with signiﬁcantly lower am-
pliﬁcation rates. Preliminary research results show that these
features do, however, still show severe ampliﬁcation rates and
are supported by a larger set of servers. As of writing this,
we are still investigating the dimensions of and appropriate
countermeasures against these problems with NTP server de-
velopers and CERTs. We leave a complete analysis of these
further NTP features open to future work.

3) DNS: Name lookups (e.g., A or MX records), the tra-
ditional use-case of DNS, have low ampliﬁcation rates. Tra-
ditionally, the size of UDP replies was limited to 512 bytes
and DNS switched to TCP communication for larger replies.
However, many DNS servers adopted the DNS extensions
(EDNS0) that allow for UDP responses of up to 4096 bytes.
Attackers may abuse ANY request with EDNS0, for which a
server returns all known DNS record types for a given domain.

We distinguish between two different attacks abusing DNS
for ampliﬁcation. First, in our setting DNSOR, an attacker
abuses open resolvers as ampliﬁers. Attackers can enforce high
ampliﬁcation rates by resolving ANY requests from domains
that result in large responses. In fact, an attacker could even
conﬁgure a domain he controls such that
its authoritative
name server responds with exactly 4096-byte-wide responses.
As these responses will be cached by the resolvers (i.e., the
ampliﬁers) according to the TTL, the attacker’s domain would
face only little load. Depending on the queried domain name
length and the maximum EDNS0 size a resolver supports, this
ampliﬁes the UDP payload by factor 28.7–64.1.

Network operators have become aware of this kind of abuse
and the number of open DNS resolvers is gradually decreasing.
However, there is an increasing number of authoritative name
servers that include larger resource records in their responses.
One of the reasons is the deployment of DNSSEC [5], in which
each resource record is accompanied with a typically 1024-
bit-wide signature in a special RRSIG record. In a second
attack setting, DNSNS, we thus measure the ampliﬁcation rate
when an attacker sends ANY requests to authoritative name
servers only. We compute the ampliﬁcation factors without
the requirement to conﬁgure a specialized attack domain. In
our experiment, we send ANY requests to the authoritative
name servers found in our crawl and ﬁlter on the 1404 name
servers that deploy DNSSEC for at least one domain. We then
observed a BAF of 54.6, which can be even as high as 98.3
for the top 10% of authoritative name servers.

Intuitively, one would expect that the ampliﬁcation rate for
open resolvers is higher than for authoritative name servers, as
the attacker can (as we did) control and maximize the contents
of the response to an ANY request. However, the reason why
the BAF is lower for DNSOR than in DNSNS is that many
open resolvers did not support EDNS0 and thus chopped the
responses to 512 bytes. We did not observe such a behavior
for most of the authoritative name servers.

4) NetBios: In NetBios, we achieve the highest ampliﬁ-
cation using a name lookup, for which a receiving Windows
system responds with its current network and host name con-
ﬁguration. We observed an average BAF of 3.8. The response
sizes are inﬂuenced by the host names and network setups of
the ampliﬁers. When focusing on the top 10% of ampliﬁers
the BAF is 4.9.

5

5) SSDP: Upon SSDP discovery requests, UPnP-
enabled hosts respond with one reply packet per “service”
they have conﬁgured. On average, we achieved a BAF of 30.8.
The response size depends on the conﬁgured services and the
length of the service name (“USN”). Some of the ampliﬁers
responded with a few reply packets only, as they offer fewer
services. An attacker could thus achieve a higher BAF of 75.9
when using the top-10%-ampliﬁers only.

6) CharGen: According to RFC 864, CharGen servers
reply with random characters to incoming UDP datagrams of
any length. We therefore chose to send requests of a single
byte (a technique we will later also observe to be used by
attackers). On average, we received 358.8 bytes from the
CharGen servers, whereas the statistical mode of the response
sizes was 74 bytes and a few servers replied with up to 1472
bytes. We chose not to calculate BAFs on subsets of the servers
due to lack of statistical signiﬁcance for the relatively small
set of 34 ampliﬁers in our dataset3.

7) QOTD: Similar to CharGen, also Quote of the Day
servers (RFC 865) send replies to UDP datagrams of any
length. The average response size (i.e., quote length) was
140.3. Again, we do not calculate the BAF for ampliﬁer subsets
due to missing statistical signiﬁcance.

8) BitTorrent:

In BitTorrent, we identiﬁed that hash
searches – which are primarily used to ﬁnd peers that serve
a speciﬁc ﬁle – may result in large responses. While nor-
mal peers only return a list of neighboring peers, BitTorrent
trackers also include two 256-byte-wide bloom ﬁlter arrays
with BitTorrent swarm information in their reply4. As not all
peers know and share this information, the BAF varies among
ampliﬁers. In our experiment, we tried to maximize the number
of tracker replies by searching for the most prominent 100 ﬁle
hashes5. While the average BAF is 3.8 only, an attacker can
achieve a BAF of 10.3 by abusing the top 10% of the ampliﬁers
(typically BitTorrent trackers).

9) Kad: We use a peer list exchange message to gain a BAF
between 16.3 and 22.7 in Kad. Upon a 35-byte-wide peer list
request, a Kademlia client shares up to 31 peers, which consist
of an ID (16 byte), IP address (4 byte) and UDP port (2 byte)
plus Kademlia message header and meta data. The number of
peers shared depends on the client implementation and varied
between 15 and 31 peers in our crawl. The ampliﬁcation is
higher compared to BitTorrent due to the smaller requests.

10) Quake 3: For the Quake 3 game servers we found
the highest ampliﬁcation when asking a server for its current
status, a 15-byte-wide request. The reply is signiﬁcantly larger
and includes, e.g., the detailed server conﬁguration and a list
of current players. The average BAF was 63.9, but was as high
as 82.8 for the top-10% servers with many active players and
complex server conﬁgurations.

11) Steam: The Steam game protocol is used by a large
number of games such as Counter-Strike, Half-Life or Team
Fortress. Again, we can leverage the status information request
to ﬂood a potential victim with server status replies, with

3Note that the number of ampliﬁers availablet to us is so low because we

only scanned a subset of all available IPv4 addresses

4See BEP 33: http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep 0033.html
5We obtained this list from http://thepiratebay.sx/top/all

similar implications as for Quake 3. The average BAF of 5.5 is
lower than for Quake 3, as the status replies do not contain the
list of active players, the requests are larger (25 bytes) and the
server status replies are dense. When focusing on the top-10%,
we achieved a BAF of 14.7.

12) ZeroAccess: The ZeroAccess P2P botnet in version 2
(ZAv2)6 supports three message types in its P2P commu-
nication, of which the peer list and command exchange is
most effective in terms of ampliﬁcation. For a request of
only 16 bytes, a ZAv2 bot returns 16 neighbors (8 bytes
each) and information about the currently active malicious
modules, including a 128-byte-wide RSA signature by the
botmaster. This results in BAFs of 36.0-41.1. Usually bots are
synchronized regarding the commands, i.e., we observed only
a low ampliﬁcation derivation between all responses.

13) Sality: Similar to ZeroAccess, also the Sality P2P
bot offers three message types as part of its command-and-
control communication. Sality is a malware downloader and
bots can thus exchange URL lists of ﬁles that bots should
install on the infected PC, including a 256-byte-wide RSA
signature. We measured a BAF of 37.3–38.4. Again, most bots
are synchronized regarding the current URL lists, so there is
only little gain in choosing ampliﬁer subsets.

14)Gameover: In the Gameover P2P bot, a banking trojan,
we leverage the peer list and proxy list exchange mechanism
to achieve highest ampliﬁcation. For a 52-byte-wide UDP
payload, Gameover bots ﬁrst reply with a list of up to ten
neighboring peers [2]. In addition, bots send four additional
datagrams with a list of proxies that can be used to upload data,
such as stolen online banking credentials. The average number
of packets is even larger: Gameover peers may issue counter-
requests to ampliﬁcation victims, an artifact that increases
the packet ampliﬁcation above 5. In total, Gameover offers
a relatively constant BAF of 46.

IV. REAL-WORLD OBSERVATIONS

The ampliﬁcation potential identiﬁed in the previous sec-
tion is attractive to attackers who follow our threat model. In
this section, we analyze to what extent such attacks can be
observed in the wild. First, using Netﬂow data from a large
ISP, we search for DRDoS attack victims and for ampliﬁers
that are abused during DRDoS attacks. Second, we search
for UDP port scans in darknet trafﬁc, which may indicate
that attackers try to spy on ampliﬁers. Third, we publish and
monitor ampliﬁcation baits which are attractive to be abused
in ampliﬁcation attacks.

A. Dataset Descriptions

1) Netﬂow data: We obtained Netﬂow data from a large
European ISP comprising about 1 million end users (consumer
and business). The ISP hosts multiple servers that are vul-
nerable to ampliﬁcation attacks. We manually conﬁrmed the
presence of open DNS resolvers, authoritative name servers,
various game servers, NTP servers, SNMP- and SSDP-enabled
hosts, four CharGen servers, dozens of clients infected with
P2P-bots and plenty of P2P ﬁle sharing users. The ISP blocks

peers [26] and we therefore did not further analyze it

6

IP spooﬁng for egress packets, but we can still use the dataset
to detect incoming DRDoS attacks and abuses of ampliﬁers
within the ISP’s network(s).

The dataset spans from July 14th to July 25th 2013 (12
days). Due to the high load on the routers, the ISP sampled
Netﬂow data and conﬁgured the routers to randomly choose
1/100th of all packets for Netﬂow recording. Luckily, due to
the aggressive nature of DDoS attacks, such a sampling does
not interfere with our goals to detect the attacks. We ﬁlter the
Netﬂow data on the UDP ports of the protocols with a ﬁxed
server port (see Table I on page 3) to ease analysis. We will
thus miss a few protocols in favor of a higher data processing
performance.

2) Darknet trafﬁc: Darknets are unused IP address ranges,
i.e., networks in which no services or users are hosted and that
should thus not be used in legitimate cases. Any trafﬁc directed
to the darknet can be considered as background Internet trafﬁc,
such as backscatter or scans. Darknets are thus a suitable
setting to identify scanning activity [3, 40, 6]. We have access
to two darknets with different granularity. Darknet D1 spans
a /17 network and is monitored using Netﬂow. Darknet D2
spans a disjoint /27 network and we record the full network
traces to allow packet inspection. We use four weeks of trafﬁc
from June/July 2013 in both darknets for further analysis.

3) Ampliﬁer baits: Third, we published bait services on
the Internet that are vulnerable to ampliﬁcation abuse. We
tried to make these baits public and attractive to attackers.
For example, we hosted game servers for Quake 3 and
Steam, registered them at the Master server and added bots
(non-human players) to increase the ampliﬁcation factor for
these servers. We started a public NTP server and listed it
in public NTP pools. In addition, we spawned ﬁle sharing
clients for BitTorrent (uTorrent) and Kad (eMule) and let
them download and seed popular ﬁles. We also have access
to a real authoritative name servers that hosts a DNSSEC-
enabled domain with Google’s PageRank popularity of ﬁve.
We implemented and launched CharGen and QOTD services.
Finally, we infected each a separate Windows VM with one
of the malicious P2P-based bots and limited the network
connectivity to the P2P communication, mitigating all potential
threats by the bot such as spam or clickfraud. We exposed
these services end-June7 and have been operating them for
four consecutive weeks before analyzing the data.

We operate the baits on public IPv4 addresses to prevent
side-effects from ﬁrewalls or NAT gateways. This may raise
ethical concerns, as we publish services that can be abused for
DDoS attacks, i.e., our baits may participate in real attacks.
To mitigate this harm, we strictly monitored these systems
and throttled the maximum uplink bandwidth for each of the
services to 1 MBit/s. In addition, when we saw that an attack
started, we immediately blocked the outgoing trafﬁc on a per-
IP address basis. This way, even if the bait services are abused
for ampliﬁcation attacks,
is limited and
represents less bandwidth than a typical ampliﬁer would have.
Admittedly, though, we could not entirely avoid participating
in actual attacks. We hope, however, that the insights that we
got compensate the potential harm of our experiments.

7The authoritative DNS servers under analysis are already in use since 2008

and the P2P-based bots were launched in April 2013.

B. Real-world Ampliﬁcation Scans

We ﬁrst aim to identify UDP-based scanning activities that
may indicate attackers who search for ampliﬁers. As we have
shown in Section III, ampliﬁers for most protocols can be
found by horizontally scanning the Internet for open services.
With horizontally we mean that attackers choose one service
that they want to abuse and then scan (a subset of) the IP
address space for potential ampliﬁers for this service. Such
Internet-wide scans can be identiﬁed using darknets [6, 40, 3].
We leverage our two darknet datasets, D1 and D2, to in-
spect what services are prominent to be scanned by potential
attackers. We obtain a concise overview by aggregating the
packets received in our darknets per UDP port. Detecting TCP-
based scanning activity is unrelated to bandwidth ampliﬁcation
attacks and is therefore outside the scope of this work.

TABLE IV: Most popular UDP scans as found in the darknets. Pkts
shows the absolute number of packets during the measured interval,
pps and pph show the packet rate in seconds and hours, respectively.
Bpp indicates the average UDP payload size in bytes.

Table IV summarizes the trafﬁc statistics for the top-10
most prominent UDP ports in darknet D1. We will mainly
use D2 to manually inspect the scans, but for completeness,
we also list the numbers of D2 in the table. Table IV shows
four protocols that we identiﬁed as vulnerable to ampliﬁcation
attacks: DNS, CharGen, NetBios and SNMP. We use the
network traces recorded at D2 to manually inspect the trafﬁc
for these protocols.

From our set of vulnerable protocols, DNS is clearly
most popular and even in the smaller darknet D2 we found
176 different hosts scanning for open resolvers. Interestingly,
we identiﬁed quite a few security groups exploring open
DNS resolvers, such as dnsresearch.us, openresolverproject.
org, dnsscan.shadowserver.org and jupitoris.jaist.ac.jp. How-
ever, 27% of the scan sources requested recursive ANY
lookups, an indication they search for open resolvers with
high ampliﬁcation rates. One attacker used 94 IP addresses
from a /23 network to resolve www.google.com. Even in
the small darknet D2, we recognized 21 different request
patterns (grouping based on requested type, domain and EDNS
options), showing that various parties are interested in ﬁnding
open resolvers.

For CharGen, all hosts sent one byte UDP payload to scan
for servers, in all cases except one the value 0x01. This may
indicate that the code used for scanning for CharGen servers is
shared among attackers. Similarly, all the NetBios scans used
equal name queries, except that the transaction ID was always
randomized and the broadcast ﬂag was set in a few cases –
possibly an artifact of the Conﬁcker worm [22]. For SNMP,

7

we saw that scanners searched both, for SNMP v1 hosts (63%)
and SNMP v2 hosts (37%), using a mixture of bulk- and non-
bulk requests all in the “public” community8. NTP and SSDP
were not present in the top-20 list of D1. We also did not ﬁnd
NTP monlist requests in D2, showing (yet) little interest by
attackers in these protocols.

The darknets reveal also scans for protocols other than the
ones we discuss in this paper. For example, most prominent,
attackers scan for SIP-enabled devices (UDP port 5060/5061).
However, the high number of average bytes per packet (>400)
these scans are not related to ampliﬁcation
suggests that
attacks. Likewise, the scans for MSSQL servers rather indicate
other scanning motivations, e.g., identifying devices vulnerable
to exploitation. The low packet sizes for scans for Teredo
tunnels and two unknown services (ports 4614/39455) may
suggest attackers search for devices vulnerable for ampliﬁ-
cation attacks. However, manual payload inspection did not
reveal the intention of these scans.

C. Real-world DRDoS Victims

In this section, we aim to detect DRDoS victims in an
ISP’s network. We follow the intuition that DRDoS victims
will receive large amounts of trafﬁc from ampliﬁers, while
they have never requested data from the ampliﬁers.

Fig. 2: A DRDoS attack against a host V with three attacking
ampliﬁers (M1, M2, M3) and two legitimate hosts (a, b). The arrows
show the average bandwidth per communication stream.

Figure 2 shows a typical ampliﬁcation attack scenario. In
this example, three ampliﬁers (black nodes) are abused by an
attacker to relay large amounts of trafﬁc to the victim. Due
to IP address spooﬁng, the attacker remains invisible to the
victim. However, from the victim’s perspective, the ampliﬁers
can be detected by correlating the in- and outgoing trafﬁc per
client. For example, while ampliﬁer M2 sends trafﬁc with an
average bandwidth of 3 MB/s, V never sent any requests to
M2. In the normal case, such as for legitimate hosts a and b,
we observe a more balanced ratio between in- and outgoing
trafﬁc. Note that a high bandwidth towards a host alone is not
only characteristic for DRDoS attacks. In Figure 2, nodes V
and a may, e.g., transfer large ﬁles using UDP, causing high
transfer rates.

We leverage these observations to detect victims of ampliﬁ-
cation attacks using the Netﬂow dataset. For each client/server
pair, we extract a few network characteristics by aggregating

8In SNMP, the community string is used for authentication purposes, the

default setting of “public” for most devices is therefore wide-spread.

8

Netﬂow data. In this context, a server runs a speciﬁc service
that is vulnerable to ampliﬁcation attacks, thus the servers
represent the set of potential ampliﬁers. We restrict our analysis
on network protocols that use a ﬁxed UDP port and we
can thus identify servers by their (IP address, UDP port)
tuple. For example, to ﬁnd DNS servers, we search for hosts
that send UDP packets with source port 53.9 A client
is
any host, identiﬁed only by its IP address (ignoring client
ports), communicating with a server. We consider all clients
as potential DRDoS victims. In the rare case if both hosts of
a ﬂow communicate on server ports, we treat the hosts both
as client and as server.

We then create a pairﬂow for each client/server pair and

aggregate a few light-weight communication features:

pairf low := < CIP , SIP , Sport, B2s, B2c, t >

A client/server pair is identiﬁed by the client IP address
(CIP ), the server IP address (SIP ) and the server’s UDP port
(Sport). We generate multiple pairs per client/server if a server
runs multiple services. For each pairﬂow, we then extract the
number of UDP payload bytes (i.e., in accordance with our
deﬁnition of BAF in Section III) per communication direction,
whereas B2s is the number of bytes from the client to the
server and B2c vice versa. We focus only on UDP trafﬁc and
ignore other protocols like TCP or ICMP. Lastly, we compute
the pairﬂow duration t, deﬁned as the interval between the ﬁrst
and the last packet of the client/server pair. We can use t to
compute average bandwidths of pairﬂows.

We compute the pairﬂows for each hour in our Netﬂow
dataset. That means, for the 12 days of our measurement, we
compute pairﬂows for 288 hours separately. This allows us to
speed up computation and decrease the latency between the
attack and attack detection. We then apply a heuristic to ﬁnd
clients that are potential DRDoS victims in that we i) ﬁlter on
pairﬂows exceeding a trafﬁc threshold and ii) ﬁlter on clients
that received signiﬁcantly more trafﬁc than they sent to the
server. For i), we discard all pairﬂows f where f.B2c < TB
and we set TB = 100, 000 bytes in our evaluation. We use
this optional pre-processing ﬁlter to speed up the process of
matching client and server pairs. Setting lower trafﬁc volume
thresholds also helps to discard backscatter or scanning-related
packets [19, 3]. In addition, discarding less prominent ﬂows
helps to cope with packet sampling, as bi-directional ﬂows with
a few packets may turn into uni-directional ﬂows in sampled
Netﬂow data. Finally, we also discard all pairﬂows with servers
that are within the network of the ISP, as we do not consider
threats from within the network.

For ii), for all remaining pairﬂows, we compute a ratio
between sent and received bytes, i.e., rf = f.B2c
. If a client
f.B2s
i.e. B2s = 0, we set
never sends requests to the server,
rf = ∞. Most pairﬂows between the ampliﬁers and the
victim during a DRDoS attack have rf = ∞, as it is unlikely
that the victim requests data from the ampliﬁers10. We mark

9Note that the UDP server port alone is no guarantee for that a server runs a
speciﬁc protocol. However, in this context it is only important that an ampliﬁer
always uses a ﬁxed port, and the port number itself only gives a quick and
unreliable indication about the server type.

10There are legitimate cases in which victims request data from ampliﬁers
(e.g., for normal DNS resolution). However, this affects only a few pairﬂows
and we would still detect suspicious pairﬂows from all other ampliﬁers.

VbaM3972kB/sM1M23MB/s7MB/s0kB/s0kB/s0.1kB/s2MB/s3MB/s110kB/s83kB/spairﬂows as suspicious if the BAF exceeds a threshold Tr, i.e.,
if rf > Tr. In our evaluation, we chose a conservative setting
of Tr = 1000, i.e., raise suspicion for all servers (potential
ampliﬁers) that send more than 1000x trafﬁc volume to the
client (potential victim) than they received from it.

Results: Table V lists the 15 DRDoS attacks against
subscribers of the ISP that our analysis on the Netﬂow dataset
revealed. All times listed in the table are GMT. We assigned a
unique label (A–I) to the victims and hide IP addresses for pri-
vacy reasons. As expected, the majority of the attacks involved
DNS ampliﬁcation. The largest attack spanned 711 MBit/s
from 330 ampliﬁers and lasted for three hours. The shortest
attack lasted for 39 sec. with a bandwidth of 212 MBit/s.
Interestingly, attackers already abuse further protocols. We
found four CharGen-based attacks that involved up to 3065
ampliﬁers. Against victims C and G, we observed attacks
abusing both, DNS and CharGen simultaneously. Victim F was
ﬁrst targeted with a low-volume CharGen-based attack, until
the attackers switched to DNS and achieved almost 1 Gb/s

TABLE V: List of DDoS victims found in the Netﬂow dataset. V
denotes the victim’s identiﬁer, |M | the number of ampliﬁers, Volume
the total attack volume measured in MB, and BW the average attack
bandwidth in Mbit/s.

We veriﬁed our ﬁndings by discussing them with the ISP’s
CERT. All the DNS-based attack victims were known to the
CERT due to basic alerting systems in their networks and the
attacks could be conﬁrmed. Three of the CharGen-based at-
tacks could be conﬁrmed by correlating the victim’s IP address
with the target of preceding DNS-based attacks. The fourth
CharGen-based attack, although relatively small in bandwidth,
severely interfered with a DSL-connected customer. The CERT
was not aware of any DRDoS attack that we did not detect,
indicating a low false negative rate. However, the CERT had
been affected by SNMP-based ampliﬁcation attacks outside
of the timespan that we monitored. This shows that attackers
already abuse some of the protocols which we found to be
prone to DRDoS abuse.

D. Real-world Ampliﬁer Abuse

Next, we aim to identify legitimate services that are abused
as ampliﬁers during a DRDoS attack. Our goal is thus not to
identify the DRDoS victim (as in Section IV-C), but to detect
the ampliﬁcation abuse itself as a ﬁrst step towards service
hardening and egress ﬁltering.

Detecting the abuse of ampliﬁers is signiﬁcantly more
difﬁcult than identifying DRDoS victims. The ratio between
in- and outgoing bytes of victims was quite distinctive in
the previous context. With ampliﬁers, a few complications
are added to the detection. First, ampliﬁers act as servers
and are thus also used by many other,
legitimate clients.
Legitimate clients may have the normal demand for high-
bandwidth communication, thus (again) the bandwidth alone is
not a good indicator for abuse. Second, as opposed to DRDoS
victims, ampliﬁers always have both, incoming and outgoing
trafﬁc within a client/server pair.

Fig. 3: An scenario where A abuses M as ampliﬁer to attack V ,
while M also has two legitimate clients in the internal network (b,
c) and one external client (a).

Figure 3 illustrates a setting in which an ampliﬁer M is
used by three legitimate clients, two of which are internal
(b, c) and one outside the ISP’s network (a). An attacker A
abuses the ampliﬁer to reﬂect trafﬁc to an external victim V . To
detect this abuse in a similar way than we detected the DRDoS
victims, we have to relax the constraint of the expected ratio
between in- and outgoing bytes. From the ISP’s perspective,
V and M have a relatively normal conversation, as the ISP
cannot detect that the attacker spoofs V ’s IP address. What
remains remarkable is a high ampliﬁcation ratio of factor 30
between in- and outgoing bytes between M and V . However,
this alone is not sufﬁciently descriptive, as legitimate clients
may also show similar behavior. For example, the legitimate
client b may request DNSSEC records from M , resulting in
similar ampliﬁcation rates.

Nevertheless, we can re-use the technique presented in
Section IV-C, but with different ﬁltering thresholds. Based on
our insights on average ampliﬁcation rates from Section III, we
chose to ﬂag pairﬂows with (more than) a ﬁvefold BAF, i.e., we
set Tr = 5.0. To focus on aggressive attacks and limit the num-
ber of false positives, we set the threshold for the minimum
number of bytes sent by a potential ampliﬁer to 10 MB, i.e.,
TB = 10,000,000. We further aim to detect ampliﬁers within
the ISP’s network. We thus discard all pairﬂows with external
servers (potential ampliﬁers), i.e., servers that are outside of
the authority of the ISP (and its customers). In favor of fewer
alerts for manual inspection, we also discard pairﬂows with
an average bandwidth of less than 10 Kbit/s. This may cause
that we miss low-volume attacks, but it helps to ﬁlter out the
large number of legitimate client/server pairs with low-volume
communication.

VbcM35kB/s972kB/s281kB/s179kB/s3MB/s0kB/s90MB/s45kB/s97kB/sInternalExternalaAResults: Our method ﬂagged 143 pairﬂows in the Netﬂow
dataset as suspicious. We again discussed our insights with the
CERT to evaluate our results. We spotted six open recursive
DNS resolvers that were abused in 55 DRDoS attacks with
BAF between 34–67. In addition, one authoritative name server
was abused in three DRDoS attacks. Our methodology also
ﬂagged four closed DNS recursive resolvers as suspicious.
These servers were mistakenly ﬂagged as ampliﬁers as they
tried to resolve domains from authoritative name servers (all
of which at mail.ru) that faced packet loss and thus rarely
responded to requests. In these cases, the number of packets
and therefore the volume sent was much larger than the volume
of the received responses.

Next to DNS, we identiﬁed four CharGen servers that were
abused to attack 57 victims. The ampliﬁcation factors varied
per CharGen server from 318 to 1395 and was determined by
the length of the response string by the server. We also found
ﬁve SNMP-enabled devices that showed suspicious behavior.
In two separate time spans, one 55 min, another 1:20h, these
devices were abused for simultaneous low-volume attacks with
35 Kbit/s each. Lastly, we found alerts for potential abuses of
three Steam game servers. Unfortunately, we could not verify
these alerts, as the servers had already been taken ofﬂine when
we manually investigated them.

In a different experiment, we inspected the trafﬁc recorded
at our ampliﬁer baits. We observed one case where our
CharGen server was abused as DRDoS ampliﬁer. The attack
started just 14 minutes after the server was ﬁrst discovered
by a host – showing how fast attackers act from identifying
ampliﬁers to abusing them. In seven further incidents, we
found that our Quake 3 game server was abused, in all cases
exactly in the way we describe the attack in Section III. None
of the baits in the P2P networks, neither the benign networks
nor the malicious botnets, were abused in DRDoS attacks. We
had to ignore eight alerts that were caused by UDP-based and
session-aware ﬁle downloads, though, which legitimately have
high ampliﬁcation factors.

Overall, we have identiﬁed dozens of real-world ampliﬁca-
tion DRDoS attacks, showing that ampliﬁcation vulnerabilities
are indeed a problem. Attackers are already exploiting the
ampliﬁcation potential of game server protocols, CharGen,
likely explore further protocol
DNS and SNMP, and will
vulnerabilities in the future.

V. COUNTERMEASURES

We have shown that DRDoS attacks pose a problem
to network administrators, ISPs or even Internet Exchange
Points, which is also documented by past attacks [16, 15, 36].
In this section, we therefore discuss proactive and reactive
countermeasures against DRDoS attacks.

A. Preventing IP Address Spooﬁng

The root cause of ampliﬁcation attacks is that an attacker
can force ampliﬁers to reﬂect responses to victims by spooﬁng
the source IP address. If spooﬁng was not possible, our threat
model and hence all attacks would be mitigated. Lots of effort
has thus been spent on disabling IP source address spooﬁng.
For example, Ferguson and Senie suggest to drop all packets

that do not have IP source addresses an exit router is re-
sponsible for [21]. Many providers acted and prevent spooﬁng
nowadays so that attackers cannot abuse their networks for
ampliﬁcation attacks.

Unfortunately, still a signiﬁcant number of providers allow
IP address spooﬁng. The Spoofer Project, to our knowledge
the best public resource for measures of such kind, stated in
August 2013 that 24.6% of the Autonomous Systems fully
allow and further 13.9% at least partially allow IP address
spooﬁng [1]. Geographical tests show that the networks that
support spooﬁng are distributed worldwide, i.e., we do not face
a regional problem. While we advocate to ban IP spooﬁng, it
remains unclear if at some point all networks will mitigate IP
address spooﬁng.

B. Protocol Hardening

Despite IP address spooﬁng, we found that many protocols
were designed without considering the security implications of
DRDoS attacks. In this section, we will discuss complementary
ways to harden protocols against ampliﬁcation abuse.

1) Session Handling: One of the core issues we identi-
ﬁed is that ampliﬁcation attacks are possible if UDP-based
protocols do not require sessions. For example, the three-
way handshake in TCP would not complete for spoofed IP
addresses and thus effectively mitigates our threat model. A
possible solution for the vulnerable UDP-based protocols is
thus to include similar session handling.

In fact, a few more recent protocols already include session
handling. For example, the QUIC protocol, an UDP-based
version of Google’s SPDY protocol, assigns a source address
token to the client. The token is an authenticated-encryption
block that contains the client’s IP address and a timestamp.
Receipt and successful retransmission of the token by the
client is taken as proof of ownership of the IP. Similarly, in
some BitTorrent tracker implementations, the servers compute
a “connection ID” and send it to the client. Only if the client
retransmit this ID in future requests the tracker will respond. In
Steam, clients have to request a 4-byte-wide challenge before
they can request more elaborate server information, such as
the list of players. In DTLS, a UDP-based variant of TLS, the
server can issue stateless cookies to a client, which a client
must include in follow-up communication. The server proceeds
communication only if it can verify the cookie.

Session handling prevents ampliﬁcation attacks only if all
request types vulnerable to ampliﬁcation demand prior session
instantiation. For example, in the Steam protocol, we found a
BAF of 14.7 for the request types that do not require prior
session agreement. The other downside of sessions is that
they decrease the efﬁciency of protocols. First, establishing a
session may add latency to the initial communication. Second,
the client needs to prove its session within each request, adding
extra bytes to each request.

Lastly, it is tricky – if not impossible – to add session
handling to existing protocols without breaking compatibility
with legacy clients. Session handling typically needs to be
included during a protocol’s design phase and before the
protocol is deployed. A possible solution for protocols that
use UDP and TCP (such as DNS) is switching to TCP mode
if responses exceed a size threshold.

10

2) Request/Response Symmetry: An alternative strategy to
reduce the ampliﬁcation rate is demanding that requests are
similarly large as the expected responses. A server that receives
a request that is “too small” will not, or only partially, respond
to the request, without
the need of any session handling.
Protocols hardened in such a way are not vulnerable for
ampliﬁcation attacks, which causes that many of the existing
protocols cannot be abused by attackers. The downside is that
the efﬁciency of the protocol drops and the clients/servers face
higher loads even in the benign use case.

3) Rate Limiting: Another strategy to harden a protocol is
to limit the number of requests a client may issue. In fact,
a few protocol implementations already deploy rate limiting.
For example, a Reponse Rate Limiting feature is currently
integrated into popular DNS name servers [38]. Administrators
can conﬁgure DNS servers such that they limit the number of
responses per subnet in a given time interval, falling back to
truncated messages if the limit is exceeded. Recent Quake 3
server implementations only respond with a single status report
per requesting IP address and second. Kad implementations
like eMule count the client requests and blacklist peers that
send too many requests. And even in malicious networks like
the Gameover botnet rate limiting is in place – IP addresses are
permanently blacklisted if they issue more than ten requests
per minute [2].

Rate limiting helps to protect against excessive abuse of a
single ampliﬁer. However, an attacker may choose to abuse an
ampliﬁer at a low request rate, such as one request per second.
A single ampliﬁer does not exhibit large amounts of trafﬁc in
such an attack. Combining millions of ampliﬁers results in high
accumulated attack bandwidths, though. We therefore seek to
understand how powerful ampliﬁcation attacks can be even in
presence of rate limiting.

TABLE VI: Aggregated DRDoS bandwidth per protocol for a victim
(/32) and a victim’s network (/24) if rate limiting is deployed.

To analyze the effects of rate limiting, we assume for
a gedanken experiment
that all protocols rate limited the
requests, e.g., to one request per source IP address and second.
We can then multiply the number of ampliﬁers with the length
of the response to calculate the aggregated attack potential.
Table VI summarizes the total bandwidth an attacker could
still gain in such a setting (column /32). For protocols with
small numbers of ampliﬁers, such as in DNSNS, rate limiting
can indeed limit the harm of attacks to less than 100 Mbit/s.

11

However, for six other services, the aggregated attack band-
width is still in the Gb/s range.

Worse, attackers can evade host-based rate limiting to
some extent by spooﬁng multiple IP addresses from a victim’s
network. This is possible, for example, if adversaries attack a
network instead of a single host. We thus also compute the
bandwidths a victim with an attack surface of a /24 network
would face. With as few as 256 hosts in a network, rate limiting
fails to prevent larger attacks and allows attacks from 32.9 Gb/s
to 22.2 Tb/s for nine protocols. We thus advocate to perform
rate limiting on a per-subnet basis instead of a per-host basis.

Finally, badly-designed rate limiting implementations may
allow for dangerous DoS attacks against the protocol itself.
For example, an attacker could aim to exhaust the rate of
a DNS resolver at authoritative name servers to prevent it
from resolving domains. Luckily, the DNS-based rate limiting
initiative has countered this by falling back to truncating or
TCP. Similarly, an attacker can prevent a player from retrieving
game server status information by exhausting the allowed rate
for the player’s IP address. We leave an evaluation of similar
attacks open to future work.

C. Secure Service Conﬁguration

Many protocols can be hardened against ampliﬁcation by
ﬁxing weak parts in the service conﬁgurations. For example,
conﬁguring a DNS name server that offers recursive name
resolution to the public is considered bad practice. To secure
their servers, administrators can restrict the authorized clients
to the users in their network and discard requests from all
other address ranges. Moreover, authenticating clients would
help to protect other services. For example, most of the
SNMP-enabled devices are exposed to the Internet and use the
default community without password protection – conﬁguring
a password mitigates abuse.

are
manifold. A major issue are services that are simply enabled
with insecure default conﬁgurations. For example, vendors
often ship devices with conﬁgurations that are vulnerable
to ampliﬁcation attacks, such as network-enabled printers or
consumer routers. In a few cases, a poorly designed protocol
(or one of the protocol’s features) allows attacks and changing
conﬁgurations does not help – such as in the cases of the legacy
protocols QOTD and CharGen.

D. Packet-based Filtering

Reactive countermeasures will help as a last resort against
DRDoS attacks. Defenders, such as upstream providers, can
typically deploy packet-based ﬁltering techniques to block
attack trafﬁc. We asked a CERT about
the features their
anti-DDoS appliances offer for packet-based ﬁltering. We
understood that they typically use four packet-based ﬁltering
techniques to mitigate DRDoS attacks: ﬁlters by (i) IP ad-
dresses, (ii) UDP and TCP ports, (iii) packet lengths, or (iv)
by payload string matching.

We seek to understand to what extent DRDoS attacks
abusing the 14 protocols can be detected by such packet-
based ﬁlters. The distributed nature of DRDoS attacks evades
IP address ﬁlters. We thus analyze if the protocols have

characteristic behavior that matches any of the latter three
packet-based ﬁltering features. We proceed as follows for
each protocol. For (ii), we measure the number of UDP ports
ampliﬁers use to reply to our requests, and compute what ratio
of the ampliﬁers answered with the most popular UDP port (the
statistical mode). For (iii), we proceed likewise for the response
lengths. For (iv), we search for static substrings in all responses
which can be used for payload matching. We explicitly do not
analyze false positives of packet-based ﬁltering approaches.
These approaches are crude (but helpful) methods to separate
attacking protocols from other protocols and are often the only
alternative to null-routing DRDoS victims.

Table VII summarizes our results. For the second and third
major column, we list ﬁrst the number of unique ports/lengths
and then the ratio of ports/lengths matching the statistical
mode.11 The fourth major column shows the number of bytes
we found to be static in all replies (at a ﬁxed offset). The ’+’
indicates that further payload bytes are ﬁxed, but at varying
packet offsets. For example, we observed NetBios responses
from six different source ports that all share at least seven
payload bytes – a vast majority (97.9%) of these packets are
sent using the standard source port, though.

TABLE VII: Packet-based ﬁltering vectors to detect protocol charac-
teristics. The second major column shows if UDP source ports are
characteristic, the third analyzes the response length, and the fourth
shows the number of static bytes for payload inspection.

Table VII shows that we can use the source port to match
over 95% of the packets for seven protocols. Although not
a clear attack indicator, it gives a ﬁrst opportunity to ﬁlter
on other attack criteria, such as content ﬁlters. Length-based
ﬁltering looks ineffective for most protocols, but matches
98% of the packets of the ZeroAccess botnet12. Lastly, 10
of the 14 protocols have a static substring of at least seven
bytes, allowing for payload-based detection. Having said this,
these packet-based detection mechanisms do not necessarily
help to detection attack trafﬁc. Instead, they can typically
only pre-select candidates for attack trafﬁc based on typical
characteristics per protocol — distinguishing legitimate from
malicious trafﬁc remains tricky.

A few services stand out of the set, as they do not offer
any known way for detecting attack trafﬁc. For example,

11We accidentally did not record the source ports in the experiments for

DNSNS and thus had to omit their analysis.

12In fact, ZAv2 spans four separate botnets each running one port. In this

special case, we used these four ports as a mode.

12

the Kad responses can only be identiﬁed by matching two
bytes of payload – source ports are chosen at random and
responses vary in length. In fact, an attacker abusing Kad can
inﬂuence the response length by varying the number of peers
he requests during a peer exchange. Worse, for two botnets, the
responses are encrypted in such a way that the payloads lack
characteristic substrings, source ports are chosen at random,
and responses are padded with a random number of bytes.
This leaves defenders little chance to identify these protocols
on a per-packet basis.

VI. RELATED WORK

This section describes the related work in the are of DRDoS
attacks. Specht/Lee [30] and Mirkovic/Reiher [18] gave a
general overview and proposed a taxonomy of DDoS attacks.
We will discuss more speciﬁc related research in the following
subsections grouped by topic.

A. DDoS Attack Types

An alternative way to launch powerful DDoS attacks are
networks of remotely-controllable bots that are abused to
craft DDoS attacks. B¨uscher and Holz analyze DirtJumper, a
botnet family with the speciﬁc task to perform DDoS attacks
by abusing the Internet connection of infected PCs [4]. The
DirtJumper botnet attacks at the application-level layer and
does not aim to exhaust bandwidth, though. Kang et al. propose
the Crossﬁre attack, in which bots direct low-intensity ﬂows to
a large number of publicly accessible servers [12]. These ﬂows
are concentrated on carefully chosen links such that they ﬂood
these links and disconnect target servers from the Internet.
Studer and Perrig describe the Coremelt attack, in which bots
send legitimate trafﬁc to each other to ﬂood and disable a
network link between them [32]. All these attacks rely on bots,
while our threat model only assumes that an attacker has any
spooﬁng-enabled Internet uplink. Although the DRDoS attacks
primarily try to congest bandwidth of a single victim, they can
possibly be combined with the aforementioned techniques.

Naoumov and Ross analyze if P2P systems can be abused
for DDoS attacks by aggressively advertizing a victim in
the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) [20]. They manipulate
the Overnet P2P network and show that a potential victim
will receive undesired TCP connections and UDP packets
once it is well-known among the peers. Experiments have
shown that this attack adds two Mbit/s bandwidth and 350
simultaneous TCP connections to victims – clearly falling
behind the abuse potential we have identiﬁed for P2P networks.
Sia [29] and El Defrawy et al. [7] describe similar attacks
poisoning the BitTorrent DHT with equally low DDoS attack
volumes. Sun et al. found that a similar attack on Kad DHT
allows an attacker for bandwidth ampliﬁcation of up to factor
8 [33]. Further stateful attacks have been evaluated by Sun et
al. [34, 35] even for gossip-based P2P networks that do not
have a DHT. However, stateful attacks require peer member-
ship poisoning, which is impractical for attackers. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to analyze the ampliﬁcation
vulnerabilities in P2P protocols that can be abused for DRDoS
attacks. In contrast to attacks that manipulate P2P membership
information, we described stateless attacks. Stateless attacks
can be launched and stopped without delay in bootstrapping

or shutdown, which attackers may abuse for attacks that require
fast reaction times (such as extortion attacks).

Closest to our work, Paxson analyzed the possibility for
DRDoS attacks in 2001 [24]. Paxson’s threat model is reﬂec-
tion in general, including the abuse of (non- to little-ampliﬁed)
protocols such as ICMP and TCP. He also mentions two UDP-
based protocols, DNS and SNMP, as possible ampliﬁcation
vectors. We have discovered ampliﬁcation vectors that evade
nowadays’ detection methods and discovered 12 further UDP-
based protocols that are also vulnerable to ampliﬁcation at-
tacks. In addition, we demonstrate and measure the threat
of ampliﬁcation attacks, for which only anecdotal evidence
existed until now.

B. DDoS Detection and Mitigation

Another ﬁeld of research investigated techniques how to
detect and mitigate DDoS attack. Ioannidis and Bellovin
proposed Pushback [10], in which upstream routers collaborate
to drop undesired packets. Wang et al. propose to counter
bandwidth-congestion attacks by forcing senders to solve small
computational puzzles [39]. Sekar et al. propose LADS, a
Netﬂow and SNMP-driven system to detect anomalies of
DDoS trafﬁc [28]. A few trafﬁc analysis features in LADS are
similar to our method in Section V-D, although we tailored
our approach to DRDoS attacks.

Kreibich et al. introduce the notion of packet asymmetry
to detect unsolicited trafﬁc [13]. Rather than comparing bytes,
they chose to compare packet counters to capture the implicit
signaling of legitimate communication. Our proposal is based
on trafﬁc volume asymmetries and can thus also detect protocol
abuses in which only the bandwidth (but not the number of
packets) is ampliﬁed. We have shown in Table III that – in the
context of detecting DRDoS attacks – bandwidth asymmetries
can be used to detect more protocols (such as CharGen, QOTD,
SNMP or NetBios) than monitoring packet asymmetries.

Prior research also addressed the problem of identifying IP
spooﬁng. For example, Eto et al. propose a statistical method to
identify IP address spooﬁng by correlating the TTL ﬁeld in the
IP header with the actual hop count that a packet originating
from this source should have taken [9]. Yaar et al. propose
to detect DDoS trafﬁc by tracing back the routes IP packets
have taken [41]. Extending this work, Perrig et al. propose
StackPi, a system to deterministically mark packets at routers
to allow ﬁltering of packets with untrustworthy routes at the
recipient [25]. These approaches are complementary to our
research and may help to detect the abuse of ampliﬁers —
they cannot help to defend against DRDoS attacks from the
victim’s perspective, though.

Another line of research aims to detect scanning activ-
ities. Jung et al. propose Threshold Random Walk, an on-
line detection algorithm to detect malicious port scans [11].
Sridharan proposes TAPS, which uses sequential hypothesis
testing to detect hosts that exhibit abnormal access patterns
in terms of destination hosts and ports [31]. Paredes-Oliva
et al. compare these two portscan detection techniques and
evaluate their performance in ﬂow- and packet-based Netﬂow
sampling settings [23]. We seek for horizontal scans in a four-
week-long dataset for a post-mortem analysis and thus use a
counting-based approach to detect scans for ampliﬁers.

C. DDoS Attack Analysis

Lastly, related work covers the analysis of DDoS attacks.
Bailey et al. describe how darknets can help to identify
scanning activities or backscatter of DoS attacks [3]. Whyte
et al. propose to extend darknets by darkports, i.e., monitoring
unused ports at a system to detect scanning activities [40].
Moore et al. use backscatter data to analyze tens of thousands
of DoS attacks against a /8 network [19]. While showing the
signiﬁcance of the threat of DoS in general, they do not analyze
DRDoS attacks in speciﬁc.

Mao et al. correlate real-world DDoS attacks found in
Netﬂow data from a tier-1 ISP with attacks found via backscat-
ter analysis in darknets [17]. They highlight that backscatter
analysis reveals only limited insights into DDoS attacks. This
supports our hypothesis that attacks where an attacker uses IP
spooﬁng to directly attack a victim are practically irrelevant.
Instead, only the ampliﬁers receive spoofed IP packets, while
the victims receive non-spoofed responses from the ampliﬁers.

VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

By disclosing 14 vulnerable protocols we may motivate
adversaries to mimic our attacks. Until now, we have not yet
experienced DRDoS attacks with ampliﬁcation rates as in NTP,
where an attacker can use, e.g., a 1 Gb/s uplink to several-
Tbit/s-large attacks. Publicly discussing these vulnerabilities
may change this picture in the feature. We therefore follow
the principles of responsible disclosure and alerted both, the
security community (e.g., CERTs) as well as software devel-
opers of the most severely affected deployments (whenever
possible). We are in the process of delivering lists of ampliﬁers
to data clearing houses like shadowserver.org to foster alerts.
Furthermore, we currently implement a live-trafﬁc detection
tool of the methods mentioned in Section IV and plan to
release it to the community soon. It is unlikely that all of
the vulnerable services will be hardened at some point, but we
can work towards gradual improvements with these steps.

The reasons for the ampliﬁcation vectors are manifold.
Some of the protocols (e.g., CharGen and QOTD) have been
designed in the 1980’s without security in mind. Today, the
legacy protocols have no real use anymore. In other cases,
speciﬁc implementations of a protocol introduce angles for
ampliﬁcation. For example, public debugging functionality
(like the monlist feature in NTP) is not ofﬁcially in the
protocol descriptions but added for convenience. Developers of
gaming protocols or P2P protocols try to reduce the upstream
trafﬁc, as many end-users have accounts with asynchronous
line speeds (i.e., higher download than upload bandwidth) [14]
– resulting in possible ampliﬁcation. Lastly, due to the hidden
nature of P2P botnets, botmaster did not need to harden their
protocols against DRDoS abuse so far and are rather concerned
about protecting against takedown efforts [26].

It remains a tedious effort to design protocols that are
hardened against ampliﬁcation or even simple reﬂection. Un-
fortunately, we cannot claim that our list of 14 vulnerable
protocols is exhaustive. In future work, we plan to automate
the identiﬁcation of vulnerable protocols. For example, as a
starting point, one could use our methods proposed in Sec-
tion IV to analyze suspicious client/server sessions with more

13

relaxed ﬁltering rules. This would help to leapfrog attackers
in identifying further ampliﬁcation vectors.

Lastly, we left the inspection of TCP- or IP-based (instead
of UDP-based) protocols for future work. Likewise, we plan to
expand our experiments to IPv6, as we have found quite a few
ampliﬁers in the IPv6 address space. IPv6 may soon become
attractive to attackers, for example, because (older) ﬁltering
techniques cannot yet cope with IPv6 trafﬁc. In addition,
the IPv6 packet header is signiﬁcantly larger than in IPv4,
offering potential for further ampliﬁcation. We plan to model
these attacks in real-time DDoS attack evaluations systems like
Reval [37] in the future.

VIII. CONCLUSION

We have conceptually and practically demonstrated that at
least 14 UDP-based network protocols or service implemen-
tations are susceptible to ampliﬁcation abuse. This shows that
there is an urgent need to harden the protocols/implementations
at least of the most severely affected services, such as DNS,
NTP, SSDP or Kad. Network administrators should be pre-
pared for DRDoS attacks that are at least a magnitude worse
from what we have observed so far. We have shown, though,
how ampliﬁcation vulnerabilities can be effectively avoided.
With our ﬁndings, we hope to start a gradual – but years-long
– process of ﬁxing the discovered protocol weaknesses. Our
attack analysis and the proposed detection methods/tools sup-
port by detecting hosts under attack and identifying ampliﬁers
that are abused.

                       Service Location Protocol

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
   discovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,
   computers using the Internet no longer need so much static
   configuration of network services for network based applications.
   This is especially important as computers become more portable, and
   users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system
   administration.

[1](#section-1). Introduction

   Traditionally, users find services by using the name of a network
   host (a human readable text string) which is an alias for a network
   address.  The Service Location Protocol eliminates the need for a
   user to know the name of a network host supporting a service.
   Rather, the user names the service and supplies a set of attributes
   which describe the service.  The Service Location Protocol allows the
   user to bind this description to the network address of the service.

   Service Location provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for
   applications in local area networks.  It is not a global resolution
   system for the entire Internet; rather it is intended to serve
   enterprise networks with shared services.  Applications are modeled
   as clients that need to find servers attached to the enterprise
   network at a possibly distant location.  For cases where there are
   many different clients and/or services available, the protocol is
   adapted to make use of nearby Directory Agents that offer a
   centralized repository for advertised services.

[2](#section-2). Terminology

      User Agent (UA)
                A process working on the user's behalf to acquire
                service attributes and configuration.  The User Agent
                retrieves service information from the Service Agents or
                Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA)
                A process working on the behalf of one or more services
                to advertise service attributes and configuration.

      Service Information
                A collection of attributes and configuration information
                associated with a single service.  The Service Agents
                advertise service information for a collection of
                service instances.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

      Service   The service is a process or system providing a facility
                to the network.  The service itself is accessed using a
                communication mechanism external to the the Service
                Location Protocol.

      Directory Agent (DA)
                A process which collects information from Service Agents
                to provide a single repository of service information in
                order to centralize it for efficient access by User
                Agents.  There can only be one DA present per given
                host.

      Service Type
                Each type of service has a unique Service Type string.
                The Service Type defines a template, called a "service
                scheme", including expected attributes, values and
                protocol behavior.

      Naming Authority
                The agency or group which catalogues given Service Types
                and Attributes.  The default Naming Authority is IANA,
                the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

      Keyword
                A string describing a characteristic of a service.

      Attribute
                A (class, value-list) pair of strings describing a
                characteristic of a service.  The value string may be
                interpreted as a boolean, integer or opaque value if it
                takes specific forms (see [section 20.5](#section-20.5)).

      Predicate
                A boolean expression of attributes, relations and
                logical operators.  The predicate is used to find
                services which satisfy particular requirements.  See
                [section 5.3](#section-5.3).

      Alphanumeric
                A character within the range 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z', or

      Scope     A collection of services that make up a logical group.
                See sections [3.7](#section-3.7) and [16](#section-16).

      Site Network
                All the hosts accessible within the Agent's multicast
                radius, which defaults to a value appropriate for
                reaching all hosts within a site (see [section 22](#section-22)).  If
                the site does not support multicast, the agent's site
                network is restricted to a single subnet.

      URL       A Universal Resource Locator - see [[6](#ref-6)].

      Address Specification
                This is the network layer protocol dependent mechanism
                for specifying an Agent.  For Internet systems this is
                part of a URL.

[2.1](#section-2.1). Notation Conventions

      CAPS   Strings which appear in all capital letters are protocol
             literal.  All string comparison is case insensitive,
             however, (see [section 5.5](#section-5.5)).  Some strings are quoted in
             this document to indicate they should be used literally.
             Single characters inside apostrophes are included
             literally.

      <>     Values set off in this manner are fully described in
             [section 20](#section-20).  In general, all definitions of items in
             messages are described in [section 20](#section-20) or immediately
             following their first use.

      |  |
      \  \   Message layouts with this notation indicate a variable
      |  |   length field.

[2.2](#section-2.2). Service Information and Predicate Representation

   Service information is represented in a text format.  The goal is
   that the format be human readable and transmissible via email.  The
   location of network services is encoded as a Universal Resource
   Locator (URL) which is human readable.  Only the datagram headers are
   encoded in a form which is not human readable.  Strings used in the
   Service Location Protocol are NOT null-terminated.

   Predicates are expressed in a simple boolean notation using keywords,
   attributes, and logical connectives, as described in [Section 5.4](#section-5.4).

   The logical connectives and subexpressions are presented in prefix-
   order, so that the connective comes first and the expressions it
   operates on follow afterwards.

[2.3](#section-2.3). Specification Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification [[8](#ref-8)].  These words are often capitalized.

      MUST       This word, or the adjective "required", means that
                 the definition is an absolute requirement of the
                 specification.

      MUST NOT   This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
                 prohibition of the specification.

      SHOULD     This word, or the adjective "recommended", means
                 that, in some circumstances, valid reasons may exist to
                 ignore this item, but the full implications must be
                 understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
                 different course.  Unexpected results may result
                 otherwise.

      MAY        This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
                 item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
                 implementation which does not include this option MUST
                 be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
                 which does include the option.

      silently discard
                 The implementation discards the datagram without
                 further processing, and without indicating an error to
                 the sender.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
                 capability of logging the error, including the contents
                 of the discarded datagram, and SHOULD record the event
                 in a statistics counter.

[3](#section-3). Protocol Overview

   The basic operation in Service Location is that a client attempts to
   discover the location of a Service.  In smaller installations, each
   service will be configured to respond individually to each client.
   In larger installations, services will register their services with
   one or more Directory Agents, and clients will contact the Directory
   Agent to fulfill requests for Service Location information.  Clients
   may discover the whereabouts of a Directory Agent by
   preconfiguration, DHCP [[2](#ref-2), [11](#ref-11)], or by issuing queries to the
   Directory Agent Discovery multicast address.

   The following describes the operations a User Agent would employ to
   find services on the site's network.  The User Agent needs no
   configuration to begin network interaction.  The User Agent can
   acquire information to construct predicates which describe the
   services that match the user's needs.  The User Agent may build on
   the information received in earlier network requests to find the
   Service Agents advertising service information.

   A User Agent will operate two ways:  If the User Agent has already
   obtained the location of a Directory Agent, the User Agent will
   unicast a request to it in order to resolve a particular request.
   The Directory Agent will unicast a reply to the User Agent.  The User
   Agent will retry a request to a Directory Agent until it gets a
   reply, so if the Directory Agent cannot service the request (say it
   has no information) it must return an response with zero values,
   possibly with an error code set.

   If the User Agent does not have knowledge of a Directory Agent or if
   there are no Directory Agents available on the site network, a second
   mode of discovery may be used.  The User Agent multicasts a request
   to the service-specific multicast address, to which the service it
   wishes to locate will respond.  All the Service Agents which are
   listening to this multicast address will respond, provided they can

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   satisfy the User Agent's request.  A similar mechanism is used for
   Directory Agent discovery; see [section 5.2](#section-5.2).  Service Agents which
   have no information for the User Agent MUST NOT respond.

   When a User Agent wishes to obtain an enumeration of ALL services
   which satisfy the query, a retransmission/convergence algorithm is
   used.  The User Agent resends the request, together with a list of
   previous responders.  Only those Service Agents which are not on the
   list respond.  Once there are no new responses to the request the
   accumulation of responses is deemed complete.  Depending on the
   length of the request, around 60 previous responders may be listed in
   a single datagram.  If there are more responders than this, the
   scaling mechanisms described in [section 3.7](#section-3.7) should be used.

   While the multicast/convergence model may be important for
   discovering services (such as Directory Agents) it is the exception
   rather than the rule.  Once a User Agent knows of the location of a
   Directory Agent, it will use a unicast request/response transaction.

   The Service Agent SHOULD listen for multicast requests on the
   service-specific multicast address, and MUST register with an
   available Directory Agent.  This Directory Agent will resolve
   requests from User Agents which are unicasted using TCP or UDP. This
   means that a Directory Agent must first be discovered, using DHCP,
   the DA Discovery Multicast address, the multicast mechanism described
   above, or manual configuration.  See [section 5.2](#section-5.2).

   A Service Agent which does not respond to multicast requests will not
   be useful in the absence of Directory Agents.  Some Service Agents
   may not include this functionality, if an especially lightweight
   implementation is required.

   If the service is to become unavailable, it should be deregistered
   with the Directory Agent.  The Directory Agent responds with an
   acknowledgment to either a registration or deregistration.  Service
   Registrations include a lifetime, and will eventually expire.
   Service Registrations need to be refreshed by the Service Agent
   before their Lifetime runs out.  If need be, Service Agents can
   advertise signed URLs to prove that they are authorized to provide
   the service.

[3.2](#section-3.2). Schemes

   The Service Location Protocol, designed as a way for clients to
   access resources on the network, is a natural application for
   Universal Resource Locators (URLs).  It is intended that by re-using
   URL specification and technology from the World Wide Web, clients and
   servers will be more flexible and able to be written using already

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   existing code.  Moreover, it is hoped that browsers will be written
   to take advantage of the similarity in locator format, so that a
   client can dynamically formulate requests for services that are
   resolved differently depending upon the circumstances.

[3.2.1](#section-3.2.1). The "service:"  URL scheme

   The service URL scheme is used by Service Location.  It is used to
   specify a Service Location.  Many Service Types will be named by
   including a scheme name after the "service:"  scheme name.  Service
   Types are used by SAs to register and deregister Services with DAs.
   It is also used by SAs and DAs to return Service Replies to UAs.  The
   formal definition of the "service:" URL scheme is in [section 20.2](#section-20.2).
   The format of the information which follows the "service:"  scheme
   should as closely as possible follow the URL structure and semantics
   as formalized by the IETF standardization process.

   Well known Service Types are registered with the IANA and templates
   are available as RFCs.  Private Service Types may also be supported.

[3.3](#section-3.3). Standard Attribute Definitions

   Service Types used with the Service Location Protocol must describe
   the following:

         Service Type string of the service
         Attributes and Keywords
         Attribute Descriptions and interpretations

   Service Types not registered with IANA will use their own Naming
   Authority string.  The registration process for new Service Types is
   defined in [[13](#ref-13)].

   Services which advertise a particular Service Type must support the
   complete set of standardized attributes.  They may support additional
   attributes, beyond the standardized set.  Unrecognized attributes
   MUST be ignored by User Agents.

   Service Type names which begin with "x-" are guaranteed not to
   conflict with any officially registered Service Type names.  It is
   suggested that this prefix be used for experimental or private
   Service Type names.  Similarly, attribute names which begin with "x-"
   are guaranteed not to be used for any officially registered attribute
   names.

   A service of a given Service Type should accept the networking
   protocol which is implied in its definition.  If a Service Type can
   accept multiple protocols, configuration information SHOULD be

   included in the Service Type attribute information.  This
   configuration information will enable an application to use the
   results of a Service Request and Attribute Request to directly
   connect to a service.

   See [section 20.2.1](#section-20.2.1) for the format of a Service Type String as used in

[3.4](#section-3.4). Naming Authority

   The Naming Authority of a service defines the meaning of the Service
   Types and attributes registered with and provided by Service
   Location.  The Naming Authority itself is a string which uniquely
   identifies an organization.  If no string is provided IANA is the
   default.  IANA stands for the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

   Naming Authorities may define Service Types which are experimental,
   proprietary or for private use.  The procedure to use is to create a
   'unique' Naming Authority string and then specify the Standard
   Attribute Definitions as described above.  This Naming Authority will
   accompany registration and queries, as described in sections [5](#section-5) and [9](#section-9).

[3.5](#section-3.5). Interpretation of Service Location Replies

   Replies should be considered to be valid at the time of delivery.
   The service may, however, fail or change between the time of the
   reply and the moment an application seeks to make use of the service.
   The application making use of Service Location MUST be prepared for
   the possibility that the service information provided is either stale
   or incomplete.  In the case where the service information provided
   does not allow a User Agent to connect to a service as desired, the
   Service Request and/or Attribute Request may be resubmitted.

   Service specific configuration information (such as which protocol to
   use) should be included as attribute information in Service
   Registrations.  These configuration attributes will be used by
   applications which interpret the Service Location Reply.

[3.6](#section-3.6). Use of TCP, UDP and Multicast in Service Location

   The Service Location Protocol requires the implementation of UDP
   (connectionless) and TCP (connection oriented) transport protocols.
   The latter is used for bulk transfer, only when necessary.
   Connections are always initiated by an agent request or registration,
   not by a replying Directory Agent.  Service Agents and User Agents
   use ephemeral ports for transmitting information to the service
   location port, which is 427.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   The Service Location discovery mechanisms typically multicast
   messages to as many enterprise networks as needed to establish
   service availability.  The protocol will operate in a broadcast
   environment with limitations detailed in [section 3.6.1](#section-3.6.1).

[3.6.1](#section-3.6.1). Multicast vs.  Broadcast

   The Service Location Protocol was designed for use in networks where
   DHCP is available, or multicast is supported at the network layer.
   To support this protocol when only network layer broadcast is
   supported, the following procedures may be followed.

[3.6.1.1](#section-3.6.1.1). Single Subnet

   If a network is not connected to any other networks simple network
   layer broadcasts will work in place of multicast.

   Service Agents SHOULD and Directory Agents MUST listen for broadcast
   Service Location request messages to the Service Location port.  This
   allows UAs which lack multicast capabilities to still make use of
   Service Location on a single subnet.

[3.6.1.2](#section-3.6.1.2). Multiple Subnets

   The Directory Agent provides a central clearing house of information
   for User Agents.  If the network is designed so that a Directory
   Agent address is statically configured with each User Agent and
   Service Agent, the Directory Agent will act as a bridge for
   information that resides on different subnets.  The Directory Agent
   address can be dynamically configured with Agents using DHCP. The
   address can also be determined by static configuration.

   As dynamic discovery is not feasible in a broadcast environment with
   multiple subnets and manual configuration is difficult, deploying DAs
   to serve enterprises with multiple subnets will require use of
   multicast discovery with multiple hops (i.e., TTL > 1 in the IP
   header).

[3.6.2](#section-3.6.2). Service-Specific Multicast Address

   This mechanism is used so that the number of datagrams any one
   service agent receives is minimized.  The Service Location General
   Multicast Address MAY be used to query for any service, though one
   SHOULD use the service-specific multicast address if it exists.

   If the site network does not support multicast then the query SHOULD
   be broadcast to the Service Location port.  If, on the other hand,
   the underlying hardware will not support the number of needed

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   multicast addresses the Service Location General Multicast Address
   MAY be used.  Service Agents MUST listen on this multicast address as
   well as the service-specific multicast addresses for the service
   types they advertise.

   Service-Specific Multicast Addresses are computed by calculating a
   string hash on the Service Type string.  The Service Type string MUST
   first be converted to an ASCII string from whatever character set it
   is represented in, so the hash will have well-defined results.

   The string hash function is modified from a code fragment attributed
   to Chris Torek:

        /*
         *  SLPhash returns a hash value in the range 0-1023 for a
         *  string of single-byte characters, of specified length.
         */
        unsigned long SLPhash (const char *pc, unsigned int length)
            unsigned long h = 0;
    while (length-- != 0) {
                h *= 33;
                h += *pc++;
            }
            return (0x3FF & h);  /* round to a range of 0-1023 */
        }

   This value is added to the base range of Service Specific Discovery
   Addresses, to be assigned by IANA. These will be 1024 contiguous
   multicast addresses.

[3.7](#section-3.7). Service Location Scaling, and Multicast Operating Modes

   In a very small network, with few nodes, no DA is required.  A user
   agent can detect services by multicasting requests.  Service Agents
   will then reply to them.  Further, Service Agents which respond to
   user requests must be used to make service information available.
   This does not scale to environments with many hosts and services.

   When scaling Service Location systems to intermediate sized networks,
   a central repository (Directory Agent) may be added to reduce the
   number of Service Location messages transmitted in the network
   infrastructure.  Since the central repository can respond to all
   Service and Attribute Requests, fewer Service and Attribute Replies
   will be needed; for the same reason, there is no need to
   differentiate between Directory Agents.

   A site may also grow to such a size that it is not feasible to
   maintain only one central repository of service information.  In this

   case more Directory Agents are needed.  The services (and service
   agents) advertised by the several Directory Agents are collected
   together into logical groupings called "Scopes".

   All Service Registrations that have a scope must be registered with
   all DAs (within the appropriate multicast radius) of that scope which
   have been or are subsequently discovered.  Service Registrations
   which have no scope are only registered with unscoped DAs.  User
   Agents make requests of DAs whose scope they are configured to use.

   Service Agents MUST register with unscoped DAs even if they are
   configured to specifically register with DAs which have a specific
   scope or set of scopes.  User Agents MAY query DAs without scopes,
   even if they are configured to use DAs with a certain scope.  This is
   because any DA with no scope will have all the available service
   information.

   Scoped user agents SHOULD always use a DA which supports their
   configured scope when possible instead of an unscoped DA. This will
   prevent the unscoped DAs from becoming overused and thus a scaling
   problem.

   It is possible to specially configure Service Agents to register only
   with a specific set of DAs (see [Section 22.1](#section-22.1)).  In that case,
   services may not be available to User Agents via all Directory
   Agents, but some network administrators may deem this appropriate.

   There are thus 3 distinct operating modes.  The first requires no
   administrative intervention.  The second requires only that a DA be
   run.  The last requires that all DAs be configured to have scope and
   that a coherent strategy of assigning scopes to services be followed.
   Users must be instructed which scopes are appropriate for them to
   use.  This administrative effort will allow users and applications to
   subsequently dynamically discover services without assistance.

   The first mode (no DAs) is intended for a LAN. The second mode (using
   a DA or DAs, but not using scopes) scales well to a group of
   interconnected LANs with a limited number of hosts.  The third mode
   (with DAs and scopes) allows the SLP protocol to be used in an
   internetworked campus environment.

   If scoped DAs are used, they will not accept unscoped registrations
   or requests.  UAs which issue unscoped requests will discover only
   unscoped services.  They SHOULD use a scope in their requests if
   possible and SHOULD use a DA with their scope in preference to an
   unscoped DA. In a large campus environment it would be a bad idea to
   have ANY unscoped DAs:  They attract ALL registrations and will thus
   present a scaling problem eventually.

      M        The 'Monolingual' bit.  Requests with this bit set
               indicate the User Agent will only accept responses in the
               language (see [section 17](#section-17)) that is indicated by the
               Service or Attribute Request.

      U        The 'URL Authentication Present' bit.  See sections [4.2](#section-4.2),
               4.3, 9, and 11 for the use of this field.

      A        The 'Attribute Authentication Present' bit.  See
               sections [4.2](#section-4.2), [4.3](#section-4.3), and [13](#section-13) for the use of this field.

      F        If the 'F' bit is set in a Service Acknowledgement, the
               directory agent has registered the service as a new
               entry, not as an updated entry.

      rsvd     MUST be zero.

      Dialect  Dialect tags will be used by future versions of the
               Service Location Protocol to indicate a variant of
               vocabulary used.  This field is reserved and MUST be set
               to 0 for compatibility with future versions of the
               Service Location Protocol.

      Language Code
               Strings within the remainder of the message which follows
               are to be interpreted in the language encoded (see
               [section 17](#section-17) and [appendix A](#appendix-A)) in this field.

      Character Encoding
               The characters making up strings within the remainder of
               the message may be encoded in any standardized encoding
               (see [section 17.1](#section-17.1)).

      Transaction Identifier (XID)
               The XID (transaction ID) field allows the requester to
               match replies to individual requests (see [section 4.1](#section-4.1)).

               Note that, whenever there is an Attribute Authentication
               block, there will also be a URL Authentication block.
               Thus, it is an error to have the 'A' bit set without also
               having the 'U' bit set.

[4.1](#section-4.1). Use of Transaction IDs (XIDs)

   Retransmission is used to ensure reliable transactions in the Service
   Location Protocol.  If a User Agent or Service Agent sends a message
   and fails to receive an expected response, the message will be sent
   again.  Retransmission of the same Service Location datagram should

   not contain an updated XID. It is quite possible the original request
   reached the DA or SA, but reply failed to reach the requester.  Using
   the same XID allows the DA or SA to cache its reply to the original
   request and then send it again, should a duplicate request arrive.
   This cached information should only be held very briefly
   (CONFIG_INTERVAL_0.)  Any registration or deregistration at a
   Directory Agent, or change of service information at a SA should
   flush this cache so that the information returned to the client is
   always valid.

   The requester creates the XID from an initial random seed and
   increments it by one for each request it makes.  The XIDs will
   eventually wrap back to zero and continue incrementing from there.

   Directory Agents use XID values in their DA Advertisements to
   indicate their state (see [section 15.2](#section-15.2)).

[4.2](#section-4.2). URL Entries

   When URLs are registered, they have lifetimes and lengths, and may be
   authenticated.  These values are associated with the URL for the
   duration of the registration.  The association is known as a "URL-
   entry", and has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     |              (if present) URL Authentication Block .....
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Lifetime   The length of time that the registration is valid, in
               the absence of later registrations or deregistration.

      Length of URL
               The length of the URL, measured in bytes and < 32768.

      URL Authentication Block
               (if present) A timestamped authenticator ([section 4.3](#section-4.3))

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   The URL conforms to [RFC 1738](/doc/html/rfc1738) [[6](#ref-6)].  If the 'U' bit is set in the
   message header, the URL is followed by an URL Authentication Block.
   If the scheme used in the URL does not have a standardized
   representation, the minimal requirement is:

      service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>

   "service" is the URL scheme of all Service Location Information
   included in service registrations and service replies.  Each URL
   entry contains the service:<srvtype> scheme name.  It may also
   include an <addr-spec> except in the case of a reply to a Service
   Type request (see [section 7](#section-7)).

[4.3](#section-4.3). Authentication Blocks

   Authentication blocks are used to authenticate service registrations
   and deregistrations.  URLs are registered along with an URL
   Authentication block to retain the authentication information in the
   URL entry for subsequent use by User Agents who receive a Service
   Reply containing the URL entry.  Service attributes are registered
   along with an Attribute Authentication block.  Both authentication
   blocks have the format illustrated below.

   If a service registration is accompanied by authentication which can
   be validated by the DA, the DA MUST validate any subsequent service
   deregistrations, so that unauthorized entities cannot invalidate such
   registered services.  Likewise, if a service registration is
   accompanied by an Attribute Authentication block which can be
   validated by the DA, the DA MUST validate any subsequent attribute
   registrations, so that unauthorized entities cannot invalidate such
   registered attributes.

   To avoid replay attacks which use previously validated
   deregistrations, the deregistration or attribute registration message
   must contain a timestamp for use by the DA. To avoid replay attacks
   which use previously validated registrations to nullify a valid
   deregistration, registrations must also contain a timestamp.

   Directory Agent) which is configured for use with protected scopes
   SHOULD implement "md5WithRSAEncryption" [[4](#ref-4)] and be able to associate
   it with BSD value == 1.

   In the case where BSD value == 1 and the OID "md5WithRSAEncryption"
   is selected, the Structured Authenticator will start with the ASN.1
   Distinguished Encoding (DER) [[9](#ref-9)] for "md5WithRSAEncryption", which
   has the as its value the bytes (MSB first in hex):

      "30 0d 06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 01 04 05 00"

   This is then immediately followed by an ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding
   (as a "Bitstring") of the RSA encryption (using the Scope's private
   key) of a bitstring consisting of the OID for "MD5" concatenated by
   the MD5 [[22](#ref-22)] message digest computed over the fields above.  The
   exact construction of the MD5 OID and digest can be found in [RFC 1423](/doc/html/rfc1423)
   [[4](#ref-4)].

[4.4](#section-4.4). URL Entry Lifetime

   The Lifetime field is set to the number of seconds the reply can be
   cached by any agent.  A value of 0 means the information must not be
   cached.  User Agents MAY cache service information, but if they do,
   they must provide a way for applications to flush this cached
   information and issue the request directly onto the network.

   Services should be registered with DAs with a Lifetime, the suggested
   value being CONFIG_INTERVAL_1.  The service must be reregistered
   before this interval elapses, or the service advertisement will no
   longer be available.  Thus, services which vanish and fail to
   deregister eventually become automatically deregistered.

[5](#section-5). Service Request Message Format

   The Service Request is used to obtain URLs from a Directory Agent or
   Service Agents.

   If a UA issues a request which will result in a reply which is too
   large, the SA or DA will return an abbreviated response (in a
   datagram the size of the site's MTU) which has the 'Overflow' bit
   flag set.  The UA must then issue the request again using TCP.

   The <Previous Responders Addr Spec> is described in sections [7](#section-7) and
   20.1.

   After a User Agent restarts (say, after rebooting of a system,
   loading of the network kernel), Service Requests should be delayed
   for some random time uniformly distributed within a one second
   interval centered about a configured delay value (by default,
   CONFIG_INTERVAL_4).

   The Service Request allows the User Agent to specify the Service Type
   of the service and a Predicate in a specific language.  The general
   form of a Service Request is shown below:

      <srvtype>[.<na>]/[<scope>]/[<where>]/

   The punctuation is necessary even where the fields are omitted.

    -  The <srvtype> refers to the Service Type.  For each type of
       service available, there is a unique Service type name string.
       See [section 20.2.1](#section-20.2.1).

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

    -  The <na> is the Naming Authority.  This string determines the
       semantic interpretation of the attribute information in the
       <where> part of the Service Request.

    -  The <scope> is a string used to restrict the range of the query.
       Scope is determined administratively, at a given site.  It is not
       necessarily related to network topology (see [Section 16](#section-16)).
       Leaving this field out means that the request can be satisfied
       only by unscoped service advertisements.

    -  The <where> string is the Where Clause of the request.  It
       contains a query which allows the selection of those service
       instances which the User Agent is interested in.  The query
       includes attributes, boolean operators and relations.  (See
       [section 5.3](#section-5.3).)

   In the case of a multicast service request, a list of previous
   responders is sent.  This list will prevent those in the list from
   responding, to be sure that responses from other sources are not
   drowned out.  The request is multicast repeatedly (with a recommended
   wait interval of CONFIG_INTERVAL_2) until there are no new responses,
   or a certain time (CONFIG_INTERVAL_3) has elapsed.  Different timing
   values are applied to a Service Request used for Directory Agent
   Discovery, see [Section 5.2](#section-5.2).

   In order for a request to succeed in matching registered information,
   the following conditions must be met:

    1. The result must have the same Service Type as the request.

    2. It must have the same Naming Authority.

    3. It must have the same scope.  (If the scope of the request
       as omitted, the request will only match services which were
       registered with no scope.  Note that a scoped request WILL match
       all unscoped Services).

    4. The conditions specified in the Where Clause must match the
       attributes and keywords registered for the service.

[5.1](#section-5.1). Service Request Usage

   The User Agent may form Service Requests using preconfigured
   knowledge of a Service Type's attributes.  It may also issue
   Attribute Requests to obtain the attribute values for a Service Type
   before issuing Service Requests (see [Section 13](#section-13)).  Having obtained
   the attributes which describe a particular kind of service from an
   Attribute Request, or using configured knowledge of a service's
   attributes, the User Agent can build a predicate that describes the
   service needs of the user.

   Service Requests may be sent directly to a Directory Agent.  Suppose
   a printer supporting the lpr protocol is needed on the 12th floor
   which has UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS and prints 12 pages per minute.
   Suppose further that a Attribute Request indicates that there is a
   printer on the 12th floor, a printer that prints 12 pages per minute,
   and a printer that offers UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS. To check whether they
   are same printer, issue the following request:

      lpr//(& (PAGES PER MINUTE==12)
               (UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS)
               (LOCATION==12th FLOOR))/

   Suppose there is no such printer.  The Directory Agent responds with
   a Service Reply with 0 in the number of responses and no reply
   values.

   The User Agent then tries a less restrictive query to find a printer,
   using the 12th floor as "where" criteria.

      lpr//(LOCATION==12th FLOOR)/

   In this case, there is now only one reply:

      Returned URL:   service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft

   The Address Specification for the printer is:  igore.wco.ftp.com:515,
   containing the name of the host managing the requested printer.
   Files would be printed by spooling to that port on that host.  The
   word 'draft' refers to the name of the print queue the lpr server
   supports.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   In the absence of a Directory Agent, the request above could be
   multicast.  In this case it would be sent to the Service Specific
   Multicast Address for "service:printer" and not to the Directory
   Agent.  Service Agents that can satisfy the predicate will reply.
   Service Agents which cannot support the character set of the request
   MUST return CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD in the SrvRply.  In all other
   circumstances, Service Agents which cannot satisfy the reply do not
   send any reply at all.

   The only way a User Agent can be sure there are no services which
   match the query is by retrying the request (CONFIG_INTERVAL_8).  If
   no response comes, the User Agent gives up and assumes there are no
   such printers.

   Another form of query is a simpler 'join' query.  Its syntax has no
   parentheses or logical operators.  Each term is conjoined (AND-ed
   together.)  Rewriting the initial query provides an example:

      lpr//PAGES PER MINUTE==12,
           UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,
           LOCATION==12th FLOOR/

[5.2](#section-5.2). Directory Agent Discovery Request

   Normally a Service Request returns a Service Reply.  The sole
   exception to this is a Service Request for the Service Type
   "directory-agent".  This Service Request is answered with a DA
   Advertisement.

   Without configured knowledge of a Directory Agent (DA), a User Agent
   or Service Agent uses a Service Request to discover a DA. (See
   [section 15.1](#section-15.1) for mechanisms by which a client may be configured to
   have knowledge of a DA.) Such a Service Request used for Directory
   Agent Discovery includes a predicate of the form:

      directory-agent///

   This query is always sent to the Directory Agent Discovery multicast
   address.  The Service Type of a Directory Agent is "directory-agent",
   hence it is the Service Type used in the request.  No scope is
   included in the request, so all Directory Agents will reply.  This is
   the only request which omits a scope which all Directory Agents MUST
   respond to.  Normally, a Directory Agent with a scope ONLY responds
   to requests with that scope.  No Naming Authority is included, so
   "IANA" is assumed.  We want to reach all the available directory
   agents.  If the scope were supplied, only DAs supporting that scope
   would reply.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   DA Advertisement Replies may arrive from different sources, similar
   in form to:

     URL returned:   service:directory-agent://slp-resolver.catch22.com
     Scope returned: ACCOUNTING

     URL returned:   service:directory-agent://204.182.15.66 Scope
     returned: JANITORIAL SERVICES

   The DA Advertisement format is defined in [Section 14](#section-14).

   If the goal is merely to discover any Directory Agent, the first
   reply will do.  If the goal, however, is to discover all reachable
   DAs, the request must be retransmitted after an interval (the
   recommended time is CONFIG_INTERVAL_5).  This retransmitted request
   will include a list of DAs which have already responded.  See
   sections [7](#section-7) and [20.1](#section-20.1).  Directory Agents which receive the request will
   only respond if they are not on this list.  After there are no new
   replies, all DAs are presumed to have been discovered.

   If a DA fails to respond after CONFIG_INTERVAL_6 seconds, the UA or
   Service Agent should use a different DA. DA addresses may be cached
   from previous discovery attempts, preconfigured, or by use of DHCP
   (see [section 15.2](#section-15.2)).  If no such DA responds, DA discovery should be
   used to find a new DA. Only after CONFIG_INTERVAL_7 seconds should it
   be assumed that no DA exists and multicast based Service Requests
   should be used.

[5.3](#section-5.3). Explanation of Terms of Predicate Grammar

   A predicate has a simple structure, which depends on parentheses,
   commas and slashes to delimit the elements.  Examples of proper usage
   are given throughout this document.  The terms used in the grammar
   are as follows:

      predicate:

         Placed in a Service Request, this is interpreted by a Service
         Agent or Directory Agent to determine what information to
         return.

      scope:

         If this is absent in a Service Request, the request will match
         only services registered without a scope.  If it is present,
         only services registered under that scope or are unscoped will
         match the request.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

      where-clause:

         This determines which services the request matches.  An empty
         where-clause will match all services.  The request will be
         limited to services which have the specified Service Type, so
         the where-clause is not the sole factor in picking out which
         services match the request.

      where-list:

         The where-list is a logical expression.  It can be a single
         expression, a disjunction or a conjunction.  A single
         expression must apply for the where-clause to match.  A
         disjunction matches if any expression in the OR list matches.
         A conjunction matches only if all elements in the AND list
         match.

         Note that there is no logical negation operator:  This is
         because there is no notion of returning "everything except"
         what matches a given criteria.

         A where-list can be nested and complex.  For example, the
         following requires that three subexpressions must all be true:

                (& (| <query-item> <query-item>)
                   <query-item>
                   (& <query-item> <query-item> <query-item>)
                )

         Notice that white space, tabs or carriage returns can be added
         anywhere outside query-items.  Each list has 2 or more items in
         it, and lists can be nested.  Services which fulfill the entire
         logical expression match the where-clause.

         degenerate expressions but they should be tolerated.  They are
         equivalent to <query-item>.

      query-item:

         A query item has the form:

               '(' <attr-tag> <comp-op> <attr-val> ')'

         or

               '(' <keyword> ')'

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

         Examples of this would be:

            (SOME ATTRIBUTE == SOME VALUE)
            (RESERVED)
            (QUEUE LENGTH <= 234)

      query-join:

         The query-join is a comma delimited list of conditions which
         the service must satisfy in order to match the query.  The
         items are considered to be logically conjoined.  Thus the
         query-join:

               ATTR1=VALUE1, KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2, ATTR2>=34

         is equivalent to the where-list:

               (& (ATTR1=VALUE1) (KEYWORD1) (KEYWORD2) (ATTR2>=34))

         The query-join cannot be mixed with a where-list.  It is
         provided as a convenient mechanism to provide a statement of
         necessary conditions without building a logical expression.

[5.4](#section-5.4). Service Request Predicate Grammar

   Service Requests can precisely describe the services they need by
   including a Predicate the body of the Request.  This Predicate must
   be constructed according to the grammar below.

   <predicate>  ::= <srvtype>['.'<na>]'/'<scope>'/'<where>'/'

   <srvtype>    ::= string representing type of service.  Only
                    alphanumeric characters, '+', and '-' are allowed.

   <na>         ::= string representing the Naming Authority.
                    Only alphanumeric characters, '+',
                    and '-' are allowed.  If this field is
                    omitted then "IANA" is assumed.

   <scope>      ::= string representing the directory agent scope.
                    '/', ',' (comma) and ':'  are not allowed in
                    this string.  The scopes "LOCAL" and "REMOTE"
                    are reserved.

   <attr-tag>   ::= class name of an attribute of a given Service
                    Type.  This tag cannot include the following
                     characters:  '(', ')', ',', '=', '!', '>',
                     '<', '/', '*', except where escaped (see 17.1.)

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   <keyword>    ::= a class name of an attribute which will have
                    no values.  This string has the same limits
                    as the <attr-tag>, except that white space
                    internal to the keyword is illegal.

   <where>      ::= <where-any> |
                    <where-list> |
                    <query-join>

   <where-any>  ::=
                    That is NOTHING, or white space.

   <where-list> ::= '(' '&' <where-list> <query-list> ')' |
                    '(' '|' <where-list> <query-list> ')' |
                    '(' <keyword> ')'

                    <query-join> ',' <keyword> |
                    <query-join> ',' <join-item>

   <join-item>  ::= <attr-tag> <comp-op> <attr-val>

   <comp-op>    ::= "!=" | "==" | '<' | "<=" | '>' | ">="

   <attr-val>   ::= any string (see [Section 20.5](#section-20.5) for the ways
                    in which attr-vals are interpreted.)
                    Value strings may not contain '/', ','
                    '=', '<', '>', or '*' except where escaped
                    (see 17.1.).

                    '(' and ')' may be used in attribute values
                     for the purpose of encoding a binary values.
                     Binary encodings (See 20.5) may
                     include the above reserved characters.

[5.5](#section-5.5). String Matching for Requests

   All strings are case insensitive, with respect to string matching on
   queries.  All preceding or trailing blanks should not be considered
   for a match, but blanks internal to a string are relevant.

   For example, "  Some String  " matches "SOME STRING", but not "some
   string".

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   String matching may only be performed over the same character sets.
   If a request cannot be satisfied due to a lack of support for the
   character set of the request a CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD error is
   returned.

   String comparisons (using comparison operators such as '<' or
   registration, not using any language specific rules.  The ordering is
   strictly by the character value, i.e.  "0" < "A" is true when the
   character set is US-ASCII, since "0" has the value of 48 and "A" has
   the value 65.

   The special character '*' may precede or follow a string in order to
   allow substring matching.  If the '*' precedes a string, it matches
   any attribute value which ends with the string.  If the string ends
   with a '*', it matches any attribute value which begins with the
   string.  Finally, if a string begins and ends with a '*', the string
   will match any attribute value which contains the string.

   Examples:

        "bob*" matches "bob", "bobcat", and "bob and sue" "*bob" matches
        "bob", "bigbob", and "sue and bob" "*bob*" matches "bob",
        "bobcat", "bigbob", and "a bob I know"

   String matching is done after escape sequences have been substituted.
   See sections [17](#section-17), [5.3](#section-5.3), [17.1](#section-17.1).

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   The Error Code may have one of the following values:

      0        Success

      LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A SA or DA returns this when a request is received from a
               UA which is in a language for which there is no
               registered Service Information and the request arrived
               with the Monolingual bit set.  See [Section 17](#section-17).

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A SA or DA returns this error when a SrvRply is received
               which cannot be parsed or the declared string lengths
               overrun the message.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA will return this error if it receives a request
               which has a scope not supported by the DA. An SA will not
               return this error; it will simply not reply to the
               multicast request.

      CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD
               If the DA or SA receives a request or registration in a
               character set which it does not support, it will return
               this error.

   Each <URL Entry> in the list has the form defined in [Section 4.2](#section-4.2).
   The URL entries in the reply have no delimiters between them, other
   than the length fields.  The URL length fields indicate where the URL
   strings end.  If the presence of an URL Authenticator block is
   signalled by the 'U' bit, the length of the authenticator block is
   determined by information within the block as discussed in [section](#section-4.3)
   [4.3](#section-4.3).  A User Agent MAY use the authentication block to determine
   whether the Service Agent advertising the URL is, in fact, authorized
   to offer the indicated service.  If, in a list of URL entries, some
   of the URLs indicate services which are in protected scopes (see
   [section 16.1](#section-16.1)) while other URLs in the list indicate services which
   are not in protected scopes, the latter must still have
   Authentication Blocks, but the length of the authentcitor is shown as
   zero, and no authentication need be done.

[7](#section-7). Service Type Request Message Format

   The Service Type Request is used to determine all the types of
   services supported on a network.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   The request should be sent directly to a DA (though it may also be
   sent to the Service Location General Multicast Address), in order to
   find out all services available on the site network (which are
   advertised by Directory Agents and Service Agents.)  If no DA is
   available, a User Agent MAY issue more than one request to insure
   that all replies have been received.  In each subsequent request, a
   User Agent includes those Service Types that it is aware of.  When no
   new replies arrive within CONFIG_INTERVAL_3 from a request, the User
   Agent can presume that it has acquired a complete set of available
   Service Types.

   The format of a Service Type Request is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Note that the <Previous Responders Addr Spec> is a comma delimited
   list.  (See [section 20.1](#section-20.1).)  The 'length of prev responder list' field

   The Naming Authority, if included, will limit the replies to Service
   Type Requests to Service Types which have the specified Naming
   Authority.  If this field is omitted (i.e., the length field is

   length field is -1, service types from all naming authorities are
   requested.

   The Scope String Field, if included, will limit replies to Service
   Types which have the specified scope or are unscoped.  If this field

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   The Error Code may have one of the following values:

      0        Success

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A SA or DA returns this error when a SrvTypeRqst is
               received which cannot be parsed.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA which is configured to have a scope will return this
               error if it receives a SrvTypeRqst which is set to have a
               scope which it does not support.  An SA will not return
               this error, it will simply silently discard the multicast
               request.

      CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD
               If the DA receives a SrvTypeRqst in a character set which
               it does not support, it MUST use this error.

   The service type's name is provided in the <Service Type String>.  If
   the service type has a naming authority other than "IANA" it should
   be returned following the service type string and a "." character.
   See [section 20.2.1](#section-20.2.1) for the formal definition of this field.  User
   Agents calculate Service Specific Multicast addresses based on a hash
   of the Service Type (see [Section 3.6.2](#section-3.6.2)).  This multicast address may
   then be used for issuing Service and Attribute Requests directly to
   SAs.

   The following are examples of Service Type Strings which might be
   found in Service Type Replies:

         service:lpr://
         service:http://
         service:nfs://

[9](#section-9). Service Registration Message Format

   After a Service Agent has found a Directory Agent, it begins to
   register its advertised services one at a time.  A Service Agent must
   wait for some random time uniformly distributed within the range
   specified by CONFIG_INTERVAL_11 before registering again.
   Registration is done using the Service Registration message
   specifying all attributes for a service.  If the service registration
   in a protected scope 16.1, then the service MUST include both a URL
   Authentication block and an Attribute Authentication block (see
   [section 4.3](#section-4.3)).  In that case, the service agent MUST set both the 'U'
   bit and the 'A' bit (see [section 4](#section-4)).

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   A Directory Agent must acknowledge each service registration request.
   If authentication blocks are included, the Directory Agent MUST
   verify the authentication before registering the service.  This
   requires obtaining key information, either by preconfiguration,
   maintenance of a security association with the service agent, or
   acquiring the appropriate certificate.

   The format of a Service Registration is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The <URL-Entry> is defined at the end of [Section 4.2](#section-4.2).  The <attr-
   list> is defined in [Section 20.3](#section-20.3).  The Attribute Authentication
   Block, which is only present if the 'A' bit is set in the message
   header, is defined in [section 4.3](#section-4.3).

   Service registration may use a connectionless protocol (e.g.  UDP),
   or a connection oriented protocol (e.g.  TCP). If the registration
   operation may contain more information than can be sent in one
   datagram, the Service Agent MUST use a connection oriented protocol
   to register itself with the DA. When a Service Agent registers the
   same attribute class more than once for a service instance, the
   Directory Agent overwrites the all the values associated with that
   attribute class for that service instance.  Separate registrations
   must be made for each language that the service is to be advertised
   in.

   If a SA attempts to register a service with a DA and the registration
   is larger than the site path MTU, then the DA will reply with a
   SrvAck, with the error set to INVALID_REGISTRATION and the 'Overflow'
   byte set.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   An example of Service Registration information is:

      Lifetime (seconds):   16-bit unsigned integer
      URL (at least):       service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>
      Attributes (if any):  (ATTR1=VALUE),KEYWORD,(ATTR2 = VAL1, VAL2)

   In order to offer continuously advertised services, Service Agents
   should start the reregistration process before the Lifetime they used
   in the registration expires.

   An example of a service registration (valid for 3 hours) is as
   follows:

      Lifetime:   10800
      URL:        service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft
      Attributes: (SCOPE=DEVELOPMENT),
                  (PAPER COLOR=WHITE),
                  (PAPER SIZE=LETTER),
                  UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,
                  (LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT, HPGCL),
                  (LOCATION=12 FLOOR)

   The same registration could be done again, as shown below, in German;
   however, note that "lpr", "service", and "SCOPE" are reserved terms
   and will remain in the language they were originally registered
   (English).

      Lifetime:   10800
      URL:        service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft
      Attributes: (SCOPE=ENTWICKLUNG),
                  (PAPIERFARBE=WEISS),
                  (PAPIERFORMAT=BRIEF),
                  UNBEGRENTZTER_ZUGANG,
                  (DRUECKERSPRACHE=POSTSCRIPT,HPGCL),
                  (STANDORT=11 ETAGE)

   Scoped registrations must contain the SCOPE attribute.  Unscoped
   registrations must be registered with all unscoped Directory Agents.

   Registrations of a previously registered service are considered an
   update.  If such an attribute registration is performed in a
   protected scope (see [section 16.1](#section-16.1)), a new Attribute Authentication
   block must also be included, and the 'A' bit set in the registration
   message header.

   The new registration's attributes replace the previous
   registration's, but do not effect attributes which were included
   previously and are not present in the update.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   For example, suppose service:x://a.org has been registered with
   attributes A=1, B=2, C=3.  If a new registration comes for
   service:x://a.org with attributes C=30, D=40, then the attributes for
   the service after the update are A=1, B=2, C=30, D=40.

   In the example above, the SCOPE is set to DEVELOPMENT (in English)
   and ENTWICKLUNG (in German).  Recall that all strings in a message
   must be in one language, which is specified in the header.  The
   string SCOPE is *not* translated, as it is one of the reserved
   strings in the Service Location Protocol (see [section 17.2](#section-17.2).)

   The Directory Agent may return a server error in the acknowledgment.
   This error is carried in the Error Codes field of the service
   location message header.  A Directory Agent MUST decline to register
   a service if it is specified with an unsupported scope.  In this case
   a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error is returned in the SrvAck.  A Directory
   Agent MUST NOT accept Service Registrations which have an unsupported
   scope unless it is an unscoped Directory Agent, in which case it MUST
   accept all Service Registrations.

   An unscoped Service Registration will match all requests.  A request
   which specifies a certain scope will therefore return services which
   have that scope and services which are unscoped.  It is strongly
   suggested that one should use scopes in all registrations or none.
   See Sections [16](#section-16) and [3.7](#section-3.7) for details.

   When the URL entry accompanying a registration also contains an
   authentication block ([section 4.3](#section-4.3)), the DA MUST perform the indicated
   authentication, and subsequently indicate the results in the Service
   Acknowledgement message.

[10](#section-10). Service Acknowledgement Message Format

   A Service Acknowledgement is sent as the result of a DA receiving and
   processing a Service Registration or Service Deregistration.  An
   acknowledgment indicating success must have the error code set to
   zero.  Once a DA acknowledges a service registration it makes the
   information available to clients.

   The Error Code may have one of the following values:

      0        Success

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A DA returns this error when the SrvReg or SrvDereg is
               received which cannot be parsed or the declared string
               lengths overrun the message.

      INVALID_REGISTRATION
               A DA returns this error when a SrvReg or SrvDeReg is
               invalid.  For instance, an invalid URL, unknown or
               malformed attributes, or deregistering an unregistered
               service all cause this error to be reported.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA which is configured to have a scope will return this
               error if it receives a SrvReq which is set to have a
               scope which it does not support.

      CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD
               If the DA receives a SrvReg or SrvDereg in a character
               set which it does not support, it will return this error.

      AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT
               If DA has been configured to require an authentication
               for any service registered in the requested scope, and
               there are no authentication blocks in the registration,
               the DA will return this error.

      AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
               If the registration contains an authentication block
               which fails to match the correct result as calculated
               (see [section 4.3](#section-4.3)) over the URL or attribute data to be
               authenticated, the DA will return this error.

   If the Directory Agent accpets a Service Registration, and already
   has an existing entry, it updates the existing entry with the new
   lifetime information and possibly new attributes and new attribute
   values.  Otherwise, if the registration is acceptable (including all
   necessary authentication checks) the Directory Agent creates a new
   entry, and sets the 'F' bit in the Service Acknowledgement returned
   to the Service Agent.

[11](#section-11). Service Deregister Message Format

   When a service is no longer available for use, the Service Agent must
   deregister itself from Directory Agents that it has been registered
   with.  A service uses the following PDU to deregister itself.

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Service Agent should retry this operation if there is no response
   from the Directory Agent.  The Directory Agent acknowledges this
   operation with a Service Acknowledgment message.  Once the Service
   Agent receives an acknowledgment indicating success, it can assume
   that the service is no longer advertised by the Directory Agent.  The
   Error Code in the Acknowledgment of the Service Deregistration may
   have the same values as described in [section 10](#section-10).

   The Service Deregister Information sent to the directory agent has
   the following form:

        service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>
        Attribute tags (if any):  ATTR1,KEYWORD,ATTR2

   This will deregister the specified attributes from the service
   information from the directory agent.  If no attribute tags are
   included, the entire service information is deregistered in every
   language and every scope it was registered in.  To deregister the
   printer from the preceding example, use:

         service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   If the service was originally registered with a URL entry containing
   a URL authentication block, then the Service Deregistration message
   header MUST have the 'U' bit set, and the URL entry is then followed
   by the authentication block, with the authenticator calculated over
   the URL data, the timestamp, and the length of the authenticator as
   explained in [section 4.3](#section-4.3).  In this calculation, the lifetime of the
   URL data is considered to be zero, no matter what the current value
   for the remaining lifetime of the registered URL.

[12](#section-12). Attribute Request Message Format

   The Attribute Request is used to obtain attribute information.  The
   UA supplies a request and the appropriate attribute information is
   returned.

   If the UA supplies only a Service Type, then the reply includes all
   attributes and all values for that Service Type.  The reply includes
   only those attributes for which services exist and are advertised by
   the DA or SA which received the Attribute Request.  Since different
   instances of a given service can, and very likely will, have
   different values for the attributes defined by the Service Type, the
   User Agent must form a union of all attributes returned by all
   service Agents.  The Attribute information will be used to form
   Service Requests.

   If the UA supplies a URL, the reply will contain service information
   corresponding to that URL.

   Attribute Requests include a 'select clause'.  This may be used to
   limit the amount of information returned.  If the select clause is
   empty, all information is returned.  Otherwise, the UA supplies a
   comma delimited list of attribute tags and keywords.  If the
   attribute or keyword is defined for a service, it will be returned in
   the Attribute Reply, along with all registered values for that
   attribute.  If the attribute selected has not been registered for
   that URL or Service Type, the attribute or keyword information is
   simply not returned.

   The <Previous Responder Address List> functions exactly as introduced
   in [Section 7](#section-7).  See also [Section 20.1](#section-20.1).

   The URL can take two forms:  Either it is simply a Service Type, such
   as "service:http:", or it can be a URL, such as
   "service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft".  In the former case, all
   attributes and the full range of values for each attribute for the
   Service Type is returned.  In the latter case, only the attributes
   for the service whose URL is defined are returned.

   The Scope String is provided so that Attribute Requests for Service
   Types can be made so that only the Attribute information pertaining
   to a specific scope will be returned.  This field is ignored in the
   case when a full URL is sent in the Attribute Request.  The rules for
   encoding of the Scope String are given in [Section 5.4](#section-5.4).

   The select list takes the form:

    <select-list>  ::= <select-item> |
                       <select-item> ',' <select-list>

    <select-item>  ::= <keyword> | <attr-tag> | <partial-tag> '*'

    <partial-tag>  ::= the partial class name of an attribute
                       If followed by an '*', it matches all class names
                       which begin with the partial tag.  If preceded by
                       a partial tag.  If both preceded and followed by
                       '*' it matches all class names which contain the
                       partial tag.

   For definitions of <attr-tag> and <keyword> see 5.4.

   An example of a select-list following the printer example is:

   PAGES PER MINUTE, UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS, LOCATION

   If sent to a Directory Agent, the number of previous responders is
   zero and there are no Previous Responder Address Specification.
   These fields are only used for repeated multicasting, exactly as for
   the Service Request.

[13](#section-13). Attribute Reply Message Format

   An Attribute Reply Message takes the form:

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

      LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A SA or DA returns this when a request is received from a
               UA which is in a language for which there is no
               registered Service Information and the request arrived
               with the Monolingual bit set.  See [Section 17](#section-17).

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A DA or SA returns this error when a AttrRqst is received
               which cannot be parsed or the declared string lengths
               overrun the message.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA which is configured to have a scope will return this
               error if it receives an AttrRqst which is set to have a
               scope which it does not support.  SAs will silently
               discard multicast AttrRqst messages for scopes they do
               not support.

      CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD
               If the DA receives an AttrRqst in a character set which
               it does not support, it will return this error.  SAs will
               silently discard multicast AttrRqst messages which arrive
               using character sets they do not support.

   The <attr-list> (attribute list) has the same form as the attribute
   list in a Service Registration, see [Section 20.3](#section-20.3) for a formal
   definition of this field.

   An Attribute Request for "lpr" might elicit the following reply
   (UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS is a keyword):

         (PAPER COLOR=WHITE,BLUE),
         (PAPER SIZE=LEGAL,LETTER,ENVELOPE,TRACTOR FEED),
         UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,
         (PAGES PER MINUTE=1,3,12),
         (LOCATION=12th, NEAR ARUNA'S OFFICE),
         (QUEUES=LEGAL,LETTER,ENVELOPE,LETTER HEAD)

   If the message header has the 'A' bit set, the Attribute Reply will
   have an Attribute Authentication block set.  In this case, the
   Attribute Authenticator must be returned with the entire list of
   attributes, exactly as it was registered by an SA in a protected
   scope.  In this case, the URL was registered in a protected scope and
   the UA included a URL but not a select clause.  If the AttrRqst
   specifies that only certain attributes are to be returned, the DA
   does not (typically cannot) compute a new Authenticator so it simply
   returns the attributes without an authenticator block.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   A UA which wishes to obtain authenticated attributes for a service in
   a protected scope MUST therefore must include a particular URL and no
   select list with the AttrRqst.

[14](#section-14). Directory Agent Advertisement Message Format

   Directory Agent Advertisement Messages have the following format:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Error Code is set when a DA Advertisement is returned as the
   result of a Service Request.  It will always be set to 0 in the case
   of an unsolicited DA Advertisement.  The Error Code may take the
   values specified in [Section 6](#section-6).

   The URL corresponds to the Directory Agent's location.  The <Scope-
   list> is a comma delimited list of scopes which the DA supports, in
   the following format:

         <Scope-list>    ::=    <Scope> | <Scope-list> ',' <Scope>
         <Scope>         ::=    String representing a scope

   See [Section 5.4](#section-5.4) for the lexical rules regarding <Scope>.

   DA Advertisements sent in reply to a Directory Agent Discovery
   Request has the same format as the unsolicited DA Advertisement, for
   example:

   The Directory Agent can be reached at the Address Specification
   returned, and supports the SCOPE called "ADMIN".

[15](#section-15). Directory Agents

[15.1](#section-15.1). Introduction

   A Directory Agent acts on behalf of many Service Agents.  It acquires
   information from them and acts as a single point of contact to supply
   that information to User Agents.

   The queries that a User Agent multicasts to Service Agents (in an
   environment without a Directory Agent) are the same as queries that
   the User Agent might unicast to a Directory Agent.  A User Agent may
   cache information about the presence of alternate Directory Agents to
   use in case a selected Directory Agent fails.

   Aside from enhancing the scalability of the protocol (see [section](#section-3.7)
   [3.7](#section-3.7)), running multiple DAs provides robustness of operation.  The DAs
   may have replicated service information which remain accessible even
   when one of the DAs fail.  Directory Agents, in the future, may use
   mechanisms outside of this protocol to coordinate the maintenance of
   a distributed database of Service Location information, and thus
   scale to enterprise networks or larger administrative domains.

   Each Service Agent must register with all DAs they are configured to
   use.  UAs may choose among DAs they are configured to use.

   Locally, Directory Agent consistency is guaranteed using mechanisms
   in the protocol.  There isn't any Directory to Directory Agent
   protocol yet.  Rather, passive detection of DAs by SAs ensures that
   eventually service information will be registered consistently
   between DAs.  Invalid data will age out of the Directory Agents
   leaving only transient stale registrations even in the case of a
   failure of a Service Agent.

[15.2](#section-15.2). Finding Directory Agents

   A User or Service Agent may be statically configured to use a
   particular DA. This is discouraged unless the application resides on
   a network where any form of multicast or broadcast is impossible.

   Alternatively, a host which uses DHCP [[2](#ref-2), [11](#ref-11)] may use it to obtain a
   Directory Agent's address.  DHCP options 78 and 79 have been assigned
   for this purpose [[21](#ref-21)].

   The third way to discover DAs is dynamically.  This is done by
   sending out a Directory Agent Discovery request (see [Section 5.2](#section-5.2)).

Veizades, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 43]

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   Lastly, the agent may be informed passively as follows:

   When a Directory Agent first comes on-line it sends an unsolicited DA
   Advertisement to the Service Location general multicast address.  If
   a DA supports a particular scope or set of scopes these are placed in
   the reply.  The class for this attribute is 'SCOPE'.

   Every CONFIG_INTERVAL_9 a Directory Agent will send an unsolicited DA
   Advertisement.  This will ensure that eventually it will be
   discovered by all applications which are concerned.

   When a Directory Agent first comes up it begins with 0 as its XID,
   and increments this by one each time it sends an unsolicited DA
   Advertisement.  When the counter wraps, it should go from 0xFFFF to
   0x0100, not 0.

   If the Directory Agent has stored all of the service information in a
   nonvolatile store, it should initially set the XID to 0x100, as it is
   not coming up 'stateless.'  If it stores service registrations in
   memory only, it will restart without any state.  It should indicate
   this by resetting its XID to 0.

   All Service Agents which receive the unsolicited DA Advertisement
   should examine its XID. If the Directory Agent has never before been
   heard from or if the XID is less than it was previously and less than
   256, the Service Agent should assume the DA does not have its service
   registration, even if it once did.  If this is the case and the DA
   has the proper scope, the SA should register all service information
   with the Directory Agent, after waiting a random interval
   CONFIG_INTERVAL_10.

   When a Service Agent or User Agent first comes on-line it must issue
   a Directory Agent Discovery Request unless it is using static or DHCP
   configuration, as described in 5.2.

   A Service Agent registers information with ALL newly discovered
   Directory Agents when either of the above two events take place.
   When scopes are being used, a Service Agent SHOULD choose a set of
   scopes to be advertised in and need only register with Directory
   Agents that support the scopes in which they wish to be registered.
   Services MUST be registered with DAs that support their scope and
   those which have no scope, unless specifically configured not to do
   so (see [section 22.1](#section-22.1).)

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   Once a User Agent becomes aware of a Directory Agent it will unicast
   its queries there.  In the event that more than one Directory Agent
   is detected, it will select one to communicate with.  When scopes are
   supported, the User Agent will direct its queries to different
   Directory Agents depending on which scopes are appropriate domains
   for the query to be answered in.

   The protocol will cause all DAs (of the same scope) to eventually
   obtain consistent information.  Thus one DA should be as good as any
   other for obtaining service information.  There may be temporary
   inconsistencies between DAs.

[16](#section-16). Scope Discovery and Use

   The scope mechanism in the Service Location Protocol enhances its
   scalability.  The primary use of scopes is to provide the capability
   to organize a site network along administrative lines.  A set of
   services can be assigned to a given department of an organization, to
   a certain building or geographical area or for a certain purpose.
   The users of the system can be presented with these organizational
   elements as a top level selection, before services within this domain
   are sought.

   A site network that has grown beyond a size that can be reasonably
   serviced by a few DAs can use the scope mechanism.  DAs have the
   attribute class "SCOPE".  The values for this attribute are a list of
   strings that represent the administrative areas for which this
   Directory Agent is configured.  The semantics and language of the
   strings used to describe the scope are almost entirely the choice of
   the administrative entity of the particular domain in which these
   scopes exist.  The values of SCOPE should be configurable, so the
   system administrator can set its value.  The scopes "LOCAL" and
   "REMOTE" are reserved and SHOULD NOT be used.  Use of these reserved
   values is to be defined in a future protocol document.

   Services with the attribute SCOPE should only be registered with DAs
   which support the same scope or DAs which have no scope.

   Directory Agents advertise their available scopes.  A Service Agent
   may then choose a scope in which to register, and SHOULD register
   with all Directory Agents in that scope, as well as all DAs which
   have no scope.  Failure to be comprehensive in registration according
   to this rule will mean that the service advertisement may not be
   available to all User Agents.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   A Directory Agent which has a scope will return advertisements in
   response to Directory Agent Discovery requests with the scope
   information included.  Note that the "service:directory-agent" scheme
   is registered with the IANA naming authority (which is automatically
   selected by leaving the Naming Authority field empty.)

   The query:

         directory-agent/MATH DEPT//

   Could receive the following DA Advertisement:

      Returned URL:        service:directory-agent://diragent.blah.edu
      Returned SCOPE:      MATH DEPT

   The same Directory Agent if it had no scope value would reply:

      Returned URL:        service:directory-agent://diragent.void.com
      Returned SCOPE:

   If a Directory Agent supported more than one scope it would reply as:

      Returned URL:        service:directory-agent://srv.domain.org
      Returned SCOPE:      MATH DEPT,ENGLISH DEPT,CS DEPT

   A DA which has no scope will reply to any Directory Agent Discovery
   Request.

   Being a member of a scope means that an agent SHOULD use those
   Directory Agents that support its scope.  User Agents send all
   requests to DAs which support the indicated scope.  Services are
   registered with the DA(s) in their scope.  For a UA to find a service
   that is registered in a particular scope it must send requests to a
   DA which supports the indicated scope.  There is no limitation on
   scope membership built into the protocol; that is to say, a User
   Agent or Service Agent may be a member of more than one scope.
   Membership is open to all, unless some external authorization
   mechanism is added to limit access.

[16.1](#section-16.1). Protected Scopes

   Scope membership MAY also define the security access and
   authorization for services in the scope; such scopes are called
   protected scopes.  If a User Agent wishes to be sure that Service
   Agents are authorized to provide the service they advertise, then the
   User Agent should request services from a protected scope which has
   been configured to have the necessary authentication mechanism and
   keys distributed to the Service Agents within the scope.  A directory

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   agent distributing URLs for services in a protected scope will reject
   any registrations or deregistrations for service agents which cannot
   provide cryptographically strong authentication to prove their
   authorization to provide the services.

   For instance, if a campus registrar wishes to find a working printer
   to produce student grade information for mailing, the registrar would
   require the printing user agent to transmit the printable output only
   to those printing Service Agents which have been registered in the
   appropriate protected scope.  Notice that each service agent is,
   under normal circumstances, validated two times:  once when
   registering with the directory agent, and once when the user agent
   validates the URL received with the Service Reply.  This protects
   against the possibilities of malicious Directory Agents as well as
   malicious Service Agents.

   Note that services in protected scopes provide separate
   authentication for their URL entry, and for their attributes.  This
   follows naturally from the needs of the protocol operation.  User
   Agents which specify a service type and attributes needed for service
   in that service type will not receive attribute information from the
   directory agent; they will only receive the appropriate URL entries.
   Only the information returned needs to be authenticated.

   User agents which receive attribute information for a particular URL
   (see [section 12](#section-12)), on the other hand, need to authenticate the
   attributes when they are returned (see [section 13](#section-13)).  In this case,
   there may be much more data to authenticate, but this operation is
   also performed much less often, usually only while the user is
   browsing the available network resources.

[17](#section-17). Language and Character Encoding Issues

   All Service Registrations declare the language in which the strings
   in the service attributes are written by specifying the appropriate
   code in the message header.  For each language the Service advertises
   a separate registration takes place.  Each of these registrations
   uses the same URL to indicate that they refer to the same service.

   If a Service is fully deregistered (the URL is given in the Service
   Deregister request, without any attribute information) then the
   Service needs to be deregistered only once.  This will effectively
   deregister the service in all languages it has been registered in.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   If, on the other hand, attribute information is included in the
   Service Deregistration request, a separate Service Deregistration of
   selected attributes must be undertaken in each language in which
   service information has been provided to the DA by a Service Agent.
   Service Registrations in different languages are mutually
   unintelligible.  They share no information except for their service
   type and URL with which they were registered.  No attempt is made to
   match queries with "language independence." Instead, queries are
   handled using string matching against registrations in the same
   language as the query.

   Service Types which are standardized will have definitions for all
   attributes and value strings.  Official translations to other
   languages of the attribute tags and values may be created and
   submitted as part of the standard; this is not feasible for all
   languages.  For those languages which are not defined as part of the
   Service Type, a best effort translation of the standard definitions
   of the Service type's attribute strings MAY be used.

   All Service Requests specify a requested language in the message
   header.  The Directory Agent or Service Agent will respond in the
   same language as the request, if it has a registration in the same
   language as the request.  If this language is not supported, and the
   Monolingual bit is not specified, a reply can be sent in the default
   language (which is English.)  If the 'monolingual bit' flag in the
   header is set and the requested language is not supported, a SrvRply
   is returned with the error field set to LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED.

   If a query is in a supported language on a SA or DA, but has a
   different dialect than the available service information, the query
   MUST be serviced on a best-effort basis.  If possible, the query
   should be matched against the same dialect.  If that is not possible,
   it MAY be matched against any dialect of the same language.

[17.1](#section-17.1). Character Encoding and String Issues

   Values for character encoding can be found in IANA's database
         <http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets>
   and have the values referred by the MIBEnum value.

   The encoding will determine the interpretation of all character data
   which follows the Service Location Protocol header.  There is no way
   to mix ASCII and UNICODE, for example.  All responses must be in the
   character set of the request, or use US-ASCII. If a request is sent
   to a DA or SA or a registration is sent to a DA, which is unable to
   manipulate or store the character set of the incoming message, the
   request will fail.  The SA or DA returns a CHARSET_NOT_UNDERSTOOD
   error in a SrvAck message in this case.  Requests using US-ASCII will

   never fail for this reason, since all SAs and DAs must be able to
   accept this character set.

   Certain characters are illegal in certain contexts of the protocol.
   Since the protocol is largely character string based, in some
   contexts characters are used as protocol delimiters.  In these cases
   the delimiting characters must not be used as 'data text.'

[17.1.1](#section-17.1.1). Substitution of Character Escape Sequences

   The Service Location Protocol has an 'escape mechanism' which is
   consistent with HTTP 2.0 [[5](#ref-5)] and SGML [[15](#ref-15)].  If the character
   sequence "&#" is followed by one or more digits, followed by a
   semicolon ';' the entire sequence is interpreted as a single
   character.  The digits are interpreted as a decimal value in the
   character set of the request, as specified by the header.  Thus, in
   US-ASCII &#44; would be interpreted as a comma.  Substitution of
   these escape strings must be done in all <attr-list> and strings
   present in SrvReq and AttrRqst messages.  Only numerical character
   references are accepted, not 'Entity References,' as defined in HTML.
   These escape values should only be used to provide a mechanism for
   including reserved characters in attribute tag and value strings.

   The interpretation of these escape values is different than in HTML
   in one respect:  In HTML the escape values are considered to be in
   the ISO Latin-1 character set.  In Service Location they are
   interpreted in the character set defined in the header of the
   message.

   This escape mechanism allows characters like commas to be included in
   attribute tags and values, which would otherwise be illegal as the
   comma is a protocol delimiter.

   Attribute tags and values of different languages are considered to be
   mutually unintelligible.  A query in one language SHOULD use service
   information registered in that language.

[17.2](#section-17.2). Language-Independent Strings

   Some strings, such as Service Type names, have standard definitions.
   These strings should be considered as tokens and not as words in a
   language to be translated.

[18](#section-18). Service Location Transactions

[18.1](#section-18.1). Service Location Connections

   When a Service Location Request or Attribute Request results in a UDP
   reply from a Service or Directory Agent that will overflow a
   datagram, the User Agent can open a connection to the Agent and
   reissue the request over the connection.  The reply will be returned
   with the overflow bit set (see [section 4](#section-4)).  The reply will contain as
   much data as will fit into a single datagram.  If no MTU information
   is available for the route, assume that the MTU is 1400; this value
   is configurable (see [section 22](#section-22)).

   When a request results in overflowed data that cannot be correctly
   parsed (say, because of duplicate or dropped IP datagrams), a User
   Agent that wishes to reliably obtain the overflowed data must
   establish a TCP connection with the Directory Agent or Service Agent
   with the data.  When the request is sent again with a new XID, the
   reply is returned over the connection.

   When registration data exceeds one datagram in length, the Service
   Registration should be made by establishing a connection with a
   Directory Agent and sending the registration over the connection
   stream.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   Directory Agents and Service Agents must respond to connection
   requests; services whose registration data can overflow a datagram
   must be able to use TCP to send the registration.  User Agents should
   be able to make Service and Attribute Requests using TCP. If they
   fail to implement this, they must be able to interpret partial
   replies and/or reissue requests with more selective criteria to
   reduce the size of the replies.

   A connection initiated by an Agent may be used for a single
   transaction.  It may also be used for multiple transactions.  Since
   there are length fields in the message headers, the Agents may send
   multiple requests along a connection and read the return stream for
   acknowledgments and replies.

   The initiating agent is responsible for closing the TCP connection.
   The DA should wait at least CONFIG_INTERVAL_12 before closing an idle
   connection.  DAs and SAs SHOULD eventually close idle connections to
   ensure robust operation, even when the agent which opened a
   connection neglects to close it.

[18.2](#section-18.2). No Synchronous Assumption

   There is no requirement that one transaction complete before a given
   host begins another.  An agent may have multiple outstanding
   transactions, initiated either using UDP or TCP.

[18.3](#section-18.3). Idempotency

   All Service Location actions are idempotent.  Of course registration
   and deregistration will change the state of a DA, but repeating these
   actions with the same XID will have exactly the same effect each
   time.  Repeating a registration with a new XID has the effect of
   extending the lifetime of the registration.

[19](#section-19). Security Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol provides for authentication of Service
   Agents as part of the scope mechanism, and consequently, integrity of
   the data received as part of such registrations.  Service Location
   does not provide confidentiality.  Because the objective of this
   protocol is to advertise services to a community of users,
   confidentiality might not generally be needed when this protocol is
   used in non-sensitive environments.  Specialized schemes might be
   able to provide confidentiality, if needed in the future.  Sites
   requiring confidentiality should implement the IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) [[3](#ref-3)] to provide confidentiality for Service
   Location messages.

   Using unprotected scopes, an adversary might easily use this protocol
   to advertise services on servers controlled by the adversary and
   thereby gain access to users' private information.  Further, an
   adversary using this protocol will find it much easier to engage in
   selective denial of service attacks.  Sites that are in potentially
   hostile environments (e.g.  are directly connected to the Internet)
   should consider the advantages of distributing keys associated with
   protected scopes prior to deploying the sensitive directory agents or
   service agents.

   Service Location is useful as a bootstrap protocol.  It may be used
   in environments in which no preconfiguration is possible.  In such
   situations, a certain amount of "blind faith" is required:  Without
   any prior configuration it is impossible to use any of the security
   mechanisms described above.  Service Location will make use of the
   mechanisms provided by the Security Area of the IETF for key
   distribution as they become available.  At this point it would only
   be possible to gain the benefits associated with the use of protected
   scopes if some cryptographic information can be preconfigured with
   the end systems before they use Service Location.  For User Agents,
   this could be as simple as supplying the public key of a Certificate
   Authority.  See [Appendix B](#appendix-B).

   [20.4](#section-20.4).  The comma delimiter is required between each <addr-spec>.  The
   use of dotted decimal IP address notation should only be used in
   environments which have no Domain Name Service.

   Example:

         RESOLVO.NEATO.ORG,128.127.203.63

[20.2](#section-20.2). Formal Definition of the "service:"  Scheme

   A URL with a "service:"  scheme is used in the SrvReg, SrvDereg,
   SrvRply and AttrRqst messages in Service Location.  URLs are defined
   in [RFC 1738](/doc/html/rfc1738) [[6](#ref-6)].  A URL with the "service:"  scheme must contain at
   least:

   <url> ::= service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>

   where:

      service       the URL scheme for Service Location, to return
                    Replies.

      <srvtype>     a string; Service Types may be standardized
                    by developing a specification for the "service
                    type"-specific part and registering it with IANA.
                    See sections [20.2.1](#section-20.2.1) and [3.3](#section-3.3).

      <addr-spec>   the service access point of the service.  It is the
                    network address or domain name where the service can
                    be accessed.  See [section 20.4](#section-20.4).

   The "service:"  scheme may be followed by any legal URL. The a
   particular service.  The protocol used to access the service at the
   given service access <addr-spec> may be implicit in the Service Type
   name.  If this is not the case, the Service Type MUST be defined in
   such a way that attribute information will include all necessary

   configuration and protocol information.  A User Agent MUST therefore
   be able to use either a "service:"  URL alone or a "service:"  URL in
   conjunction with service attributes to make use of a service.

[20.2.1](#section-20.2.1). Service Type String

   The Service Type is a string describing the type of service.  These
   strings may only be comprised of alphanumeric characters, '+', and
   Type names.

   If the Service Type name is followed by a '.'  and a string (which
   has the same limitations) the 'suffix' is considered to be the Naming
   Authority of the service.  If the Naming Authority is omitted, IANA
   is assumed to be the Naming Authority.

   Service Types developed for in-house or experimental use may have any
   name and attribute semantics provided that they do not conflict with
   the standardized Service Types.

[20.3](#section-20.3). Attribute Information

   The <attr-list> is returned in the Attribute Reply if the Attribute
   Request does not result in an empty result.

   <attr-list> ::= <attribute> | <attribute>, <attr-list>
   <attribute> ::= (<attr-tag>=<attr-val-list>) | <keyword>
   <attr-val-list> ::= <attr-val> | <attr-val>, <attr-val-list>

   An <attr-list> must be scanned prior to evaluation for all
   occurrences of the string "&#" followed by one or more digit followed
   by ';'.  See [Section 17.1.1](#section-17.1.1).

   A keyword has only an <attr-tag>, and no values.

   A comma cannot appear in an <attr-val>, as the comma is used as the
   multiple value delimiter.  Examples of an <attr-list> are:

         (SCOPE=ADMINISTRATION)
         (COLOR=RED, WHITE, BLUE)
         (DELAY=10 MINS),BUSY,(LATEST BUILD=10-5-95),(PRIORITY=L,M,H)

   The third example has three attributes in the list.  Color can take
   on the values red, white and blue.  There are several other examples
   of replies throughout the document.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

[20.4](#section-20.4). Address Specification in Service Location

   The address specification used in Service Location is:

     <addr-spec> ::= [<user>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>]

     <host>      ::= Fully qualified domain name |
                     dotted decimal IP address notation

   When no Domain Name Server is available, SAs and DAs must use dotted
   decimal conventions for IP addresses.  Otherwise, it is preferable to
   use a fully qualified domain name wherever possible as renumbering of
   host addresses will make IP addresses invalid over time.

   Generally, just the host domain name (or address) is returned.  When
   there is a non-standard port for the protocol, that should be
   returned as well.  Some applications may make use of the
   <user>:<password>@ syntax, but its use is not encouraged in this
   context until mechanisms are established to maintain confidentiality.

   Address specification in Service Location is consistent with standard
   URL format [[6](#ref-6)].

[20.5](#section-20.5). Attribute Value encoding rules

   Attribute values, and attribute tags are CASE INSENSITIVE for
   purposes of lexical comparison.

   Attribute values are strings containing any characters with the
   exception of '(', ')', '=', '>', '<', '/', '*', and ',' (the comma)
   except in the case described below where opaque values are encoded.
   These characters may be included using the character value escape
   mechanism described in [section 17.1.1](#section-17.1.1).

   While an attribute can take any value, there are three types of
   values which differentiate themselves from general strings:
   Booleans, Integers and Opaque values.

    -  Boolean values are either "TRUE" or "FALSE".  This is the case
       regardless of the language (i.e.  in French or Telugu, Boolean
       TRUE is "TRUE", as well as in English.)  Boolean attributes can
       take only one value.

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

    -  Integer values are expressed as a sequence of numbers.  The
       range of allowable values for integers is "-2147483648" to
       "2147483647".  No other form of numeric representation is
       interpreted as such except integers.  For example, hexadecimal
       numbers such as "0x342" are not interpreted as integers, but as
       strings.

    -  Opaque values (i.e.  binary values) are expressed in radix-64
       notation.  The syntax is:

            <opaque-val>    ::=  (<len>:<radix-64-data>)
            <len>           ::=  number of bytes of the original data
            <radix-64-data> ::=  radix-64 encoding of the original data

       <len> is a 16-bit binary number.  Radix-64 encodes every 3 bytes
       of binary data into 4 bytes of ASCII data which is in the range
       of characters which are fully printable and transferable by mail.
       For a formal definition of the Radix-64 format see [RFC 1521](/doc/html/rfc1521) [[7](#ref-7)],

[21](#section-21). Protocol Requirements

   In this section are listed various protocol requirements for User
   Agents, Service Agents, and Directory Agents.

[21.1](#section-21.1). User Agent Requirements

   A User Agent MAY:

    -  Provide a way for the application to configure the default DA, so
       that it can be used without needing to find it each initially.

    -  Be able to request the address of a DA from DHCP, if configured
       to do so.

    -  Ignore any unauthenticated Service Reply.

    -  Be able to issue requests in any language or character set
       provided that it can switch to the default language and character
       set if the request can not be serviced by DAs and SAs at the
       site.

    -  Require an authentication block in any URL entry returned as
       part of a Service Request, before making use of the advertised
       service.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   A User Agent SHOULD:

    -  Try to contact DHCP to obtain the address of a DA.

    -  Use a scope in all requests, if possible.

    -  Issue requests to scoped DAs if the UA has been configured with a
       scope.

    -  Listen on the Service Location General Multicast address for
       unsolicited DA Advertisements.  This will increase the set of
       Directory Agents available to it for making requests.  See
       [Section 15.2](#section-15.2).

    -  Be able to be configured to require an authentication block in
       any received URL entry advertised as belonging to a protected
       scope, before making use of the service.

   If the UA does not listen for DA Advertisements, new DAs will not be
   passively detected.  A UA which does not have a configured DA and has
   not yet discovered one and is not listening for unsolicited DA
   Advertisements will remain ignorant of DAs.  It may then do a DA
   discovery before each query performed or it may simply use multicast
   queries to Service Agents.

   A User Agent MUST:

    -  Be able to unicast requests and receive replies from a DA.
       Transactions should be made reliable by using retransmission of
       the request if the reply does not arrive within a timeout
       interval.

    -  Be able to detect DAs using a Directory Agent Discovery request
       issued when the UA starts up.

    -  Be able to send requests to a multicast address.  Service
       Specific Multicast addresses are computed based on a hash of the
       Service Type.  See [Section 3.6.2](#section-3.6.2).

    -  Be able to handle numerous replies after a multicast request.
       The implementation may be configurable so it will either return
       the first reply, all replies until a timeout or keep trying till
       the results converge.

    -  Ignore any unauthenticated Service Reply or Attribute Reply when
       an appropriate IPSec Security Association for that Reply exists.

    -  Whenever it obtains its IP address from DHCP in the first place,
       also attempt to obtain scope information, and the address of a
       DA, from DHCP.

    -  Use the IP Authentication Header or IP Encapsulating Payload in

       Security Association exists.

    -  Be able to issue requests using the US-ASCII character set.

    -  If configured to use a protected scope, be able to use
       "md5WithRSAEncryption" [[4](#ref-4)] to verify the signed data.

[21.2](#section-21.2). Service Agent Requirements

   A Service Agent MAY be able to:

    -  Get the address of a local Directory Agent by way of DHCP.

    -  Accept requests in non-US-ASCII character encodings.  This is
       encouraged, especially for UNICODE [[1](#ref-1)] and UTF-8 [[24](#ref-24)] encodings.

    -  Register services with a DA in non-US-ASCII character encodings.
       This is encouraged, especially for UNICODE [[1](#ref-1)] and UTF-8 [[24](#ref-24)]
       encodings.

   A Service Agent SHOULD be able to:

     -  Listen to the service-specific multicast address of the service
       it is advertising.  The incoming requests should be filtered:  If
       the Address Specification of the SA is in the Previous Responders
       Address Specification list, the SA SHOULD NOT respond.
       Otherwise, a response to the multicast query SHOULD be unicast to
       the UA which sent the request.

    -  Listen for and respond to broadcast requests and TCP connection
       requests, to the Service Location port.

    -  Be configurable to calculate authentication blocks and thereby
    be enabled to register in protected scopes.  This requires that the
    service agent be configured to possess the necessary keys to
    calculate the authenticator.

   A Service Agent MUST be able to:

    -  Listen to the Service Location General Multicast address for
       queries (e.g., Service Type Requests).  If the query can be
       replied to by the Service Agent, the Service Agent MUST do so.

       It MUST check first to make sure it is not on the list of
       'previous responders.'

    -  Listen to the Service Location General Multicast address for
       unsolicited DA Advertisements.  If one is detected, and the DA
       has the right scope, (or has no scope), all services which are
       currently being advertised MUST be registered with the DA (unless
       configured to only use a single DA (see [section 22.1](#section-22.1)), or the DA
       has already been detected, subject to certain rules (see [section](#section-15.2)
       [15.2](#section-15.2))).

    -  Whenever it obtains its IP address from DHCP in the first place,
       also attempt to obtain scope information, and the address of a

    -  Unicast registrations and deregistrations to a DA. Transactions
       should be made reliable by using retransmission of the request if
       the reply does not arrive within a timeout interval.

    -  Be able to detect DAs using a Directory Agent Discovery request

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   A Directory Agent SHOULD:

    -  Be able to configure certain scopes as protected scopes, so that
       registrations within those scopes require the calculation of
       cryptographically strong authenticators.  This requires that the
       DA be able to possess the keys needed for the authentication, or
       that the DA be able to acquire a certificate generated by a
       trusted Certificate Authority [[23](#ref-23)], before completing Service
       Registrations for protected scopes.

   A Directory Agent MUST be able to:

    -  Send an unsolicited DA Advertisements to the Service Location
       General Multicast address on startup and repeat it periodically.
       This reply has an XID which is incremented by one each time.  If
       the DA starts with state, it initializes the XID to 0x0100.  If
       it starts up stateless, it initializes the XID to 0x0000.

    -  Ignore any unauthenticated Service Registration or Service
       Deregistration from an entity with which it maintains a security
       association.

    -  Listen on the Directory Agent Discovery Multicast Address for
       Directory Agent Discovery requests.  Filter these requests if the
       Previous Responder Address Specification list includes the DA's
       Address Specification.

    -  Listen for broadcast requests to the Service Location port.

    -  Listen on the TCP and UDP Service Location Ports for unicast
       requests, registrations and deregistrations and service them.

    -  Provide a way in which scope information can be used to configure
       the Directory Agent.

    -  Expire registrations when the service registration's lifetime
       expires.

    -  When a Directory Agent has been configured with a scope, it MUST
       refuse all requests and registrations which do not have this
       scope.  The DA replies with a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error.  There
       is one exception:  All DAs MUST respond to DA discovery requests
       which have no scope.

    -  When a Directory Agent has been configured without a scope, it
       MUST accept ALL registrations and requests.

    -  Ignore any unauthenticated Service Location messages when an
       appropriate IPSec Security Association exists for that request.

    -  Use the IP Authentication and IP Encapsulating Security Payload
       in Service Location messages whenever an appropriate IPSec
       Security Association exists.

    -  Accept requests and registrations in US-ASCII.

    -  If configured with a protected scope, be able to authenticate (at
       least by using "md5WithRSAEncryption" [[4](#ref-4)]) Service Registrations
       advertising services purporting to belong to such configured
       protected scopes.

[22](#section-22). Configurable Parameters and Default Values

   There are several configuration parameters for Service Location.
   Default values are chosen to allow protocol operation without the
   need for selection of these configuration parameters, but other
   values may be selected by the site administrator.  The configurable
   parameters will allow an implementation of Service Location to be
   more useful in a variety of scenarios.

      Multicast vs.  Broadcast
               All Service Location entities must use multicast by
               default.  The ability to use broadcast messages must be
               configurable for UAs and SAs.  Broadcast messages are to
               be used in environments where not all Service Location
               entities have hardware or software which supports
               multicast.

      Multicast Radius
               Multicast requests should be sent to all subnets in a
               site.  The default multicast radius for a site is 32.
               This value must be configurable.  The value for the
               site's multicast TTL may be obtained from DHCP using an
               option which is currently unassigned.

      Directory Agent Address
               The Directory Agent address discovery mechanism must be
               configurable.  There are three possibilities for this
               configuration:  A default address, no default address and
               the use of DHCP to locate a DA as described in [section](#section-15.2)
               [15.2](#section-15.2).  The default value should be use of DHCP, with "no
               default address" used if DHCP does not respond.  In this
               case the UA or SA must do a Directory Agent Discovery
               query.

```

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

      Directory Agent Scope Assignment
               The scope or scopes of a DA must be configurable.  The
               default value for a DA is to have no scope if not
               otherwise configured.

      Path MTU
               The default path MTU is assumed to be 1400.  This value
               may be too large for the infrastructure of some sites.
               For this reason this value MUST be configurable for all
               SAs and DAs.

      Keys for Protected Scopes

               If the local administration designates certain scopes as
               "protected scopes", the agents making use of those scopes
               have to be able to acquire keys to authenticate data sent
               by services along with their advertised URLs for services
               within the protected scope.  For instance, service agents
               would use a private key to produce authentication data.
               By default, service agents use "md5WithRSAEncryption" [[4](#ref-4)]
               to produce the signed data, to be be included with
               service registrations and deregistrations (see [appendix](#appendix-B)
               [B](#appendix-B), 4.3).  This authentication data could be verified by
               user agents and directory agents that possess the
               corresponding public key.

[22.1](#section-22.1). Service Agent:  Use Predefined Directory Agent(s)

   A Service Agent's default configuration is to do passive and active
   DA discovery and to register with all DAs which are properly scoped.

   A Service Agent SHOULD be configurable to allow a special mode of
   operation:  They will use only preconfigured DAs.  This means they
   will *NOT* actively or passively detect DAs.

   If a Service Agent is configured this way, knowledge of the DA must
   come through another channel, either static configuration or by the
   use of DHCP.

   The availability of the Service information will not be consistent
   between DAs.  The mechanisms which achieve eventual consistency
   between DAs are ignored by the SA, so their service information will
   not be distributed.  This leaves the SA open to failure if the DA
   they are configured to use fails.

   A note on CONFIG_INTERVAL_9:  While it might seem advantageous to
   have frequent heartbeats, this poses a significant risk of generating
   a lot of overhead traffic.  This value should be kept high to prevent
   routine protocol operations from using any significant bandwidth.

[B](#appendix-B). SLP Certificates

   Certificates may be used in SLP in order to distribute the public
   keys of trusted protected scopes.  Assuming public keys, this
   appendix discusses the use of such certificates in the Service
   Location Protocol.

   Possession of the private key of a protected scope is equivalent to
   being a trusted SA. The trustworthiness of the protected scope
   depends upon all of these private keys being held by trusted hosts,
   and used only for legitimate service registrations and
   deregistrations.

   With access to the proper Certificate Authority (CA), DAs and UAs do
   not need (in advance) hold public keys which correspond to these
   protected scopes.  They do require the public key of the CA. The CA
   produces certificates using its unique private key.  This private key
   is not shared with any other system, and must remain secure.  The
   certificates declare that a given protected scope has a given public
   key, as well as the expiration date of the certificate.

   The ASCII (mail-safe) string format for the certificate is the
   following list of tag and value pairs:

      "certificate-alg=" 1*ASN1CHAR       CRLF
      "scope-charset="   1*DIGIT          CRLF
      "scope="           1*RADIX-64-CHAR  CRLF
      "timestamp="       16HEXDIGIT       CRLF

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

      "public-key="      1*RADIX-64-CHAR  CRLF
      "cert-digest="     1*RADIX-64-CHAR  CRLF

      ASN1CHAR          = DIGIT | '.'
      HEXDIGIT          = DIGIT | 'a'..'f' | 'A'..'F'
      RADIX-64-CHAR     = DIGIT | 'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '+' | '/' | '='

   The radix-64 notation is described in [RFC 1521](/doc/html/rfc1521) [[7](#ref-7)].  Spaces are
   ignored in the computation of the binary value corresponding to a
   Radix-64 string.  If the value for scope, public-key or cert-digest
   is greater than 72 characters, the Radix-64 notation may be broken up
   on to separate lines.  The continuation lines must be preceded by one
   or more spaces.  Only the tags listed above may start in the first
   column of the certificate string.  This removes ambiguity in parsing
   the Radix-64 values (since the tags consist of legal Radix-64
   values.)

   The certificate-alg is the ASN.1 string for the Object Identifier
   value of the algorithm used to produce the "cert-digest".  The
   scope-charset is a decimal representation of the MIBEnum value for
   the character set in which the scope is represented.

   The radix-64 encoding of the scope string will allow the ASCII
   rendering of a scope string any character set.

   The 8 byte NTP format timestamp is represented as 16 hex digits.
   This timestamp is the time at which the certificate will expire.

   The format for the public key will depend on the type of cryptosystem
   used, which is identified by the certificate-alg.  When the CA
   generated the certificate holding the public key being obtained, it
   used the message digest algorithm identified by certificate-alg to
   calculate a digest D on the string encoding of the certificate,
   excepting the cert-digest.  The CA then encrypted this value using
   the CA's private key to produce the cert-digest, which is included in
   the certificate.

   The CA generates the certificate off-line.  The mechanism to
   distibute certificates is not specified in the Service Location
   Protocol, but may be in the future.  The CA specifies the algorithms
   to use for message digest and public key decryption.  The DA or SA
   need only obtain the certificate, have a preconfigured public key for
   the CA and support the algorithm specified in the certificate-alg in
   order to obtain certified new public keys for protected scopes.

   The DA or UA may confirm the certificate by calculating the message
   digest D, using the message digest algorithm identified by the
   certificate-alg.  The input to the message digest algorithm is the

   string encoding of the certificate, excepting the cert-digest.  The
   cert-digest is decrypted using the CA's public key to produce D'. If
   D is the same as D', the certificate is legitimate.  The public-key
   for the protected scope may be used until the expiration date
   indicated by the certificate timestamp.

   The certificate may be distributed along untrusted channels, such as
   email or through file transfer, as it must be verified anyhow.  The
   CA's public key must be delivered using a trusted channel.

[C](#appendix-C). Example of deploying SLP security using MD5 and RSA

   In our site, we have a protected scope "CONTROLLED".  We generate a
   private key - public key pair for the scope, using RSA. The private
   key is maintained on a secret key ring by all SAs in the protected
   scope.  The public key is available to all DAs which support the
   protected scope and to all UAs which will use it.

   In order to register or deregister a URL, the data required to be
   authenticated (as described in [section 4.3](#section-4.3)) is digestified using MD5
   [[22](#ref-22)] to create a digital signature, then encrypted by RSA with the
   protected scope's private key.  The output of RSA is used in the
    authenticator data field of the authenticator block.

   The DA or UA discovers the appropriate method for verifying the
   authentication by looking inside the authentication block.  Suppose
   that the "md5WithRSAEncryption" [[4](#ref-4)] algorithm has to be used to
   verify the signed data.  The DA or UA calculates the message digest
   of the URL Entry by using md5, exactly as the SA did.  The
   authenticator block is decrypted using the public key for the
   "CONTROLLED" scope, which is stored in the public key ring of the UA
   or DA under the name "CONTROLLED".  If the digest calculated by the
   UA or DA matches that of the SA, the URL Entry has been validated.

[D](#appendix-D). Example of use of SLP Certificates by mobile nodes

   Say a mobile node needs to make use of protected scopes.  The mobile
   node is first preconfigured by adding a single public key to its
   public key ring:  We will call it the CA-Key.  This key will be used
   to obtain SLP certificates in the format described in [Appendix B](#appendix-B).
   The corresponding private key will be used by the CA to create the
   certificates in the necessary format.

   The CA might be operated by a system administrator using a computer
   which is not connected to any networks.  The certificate's duration
   will depend on the policy of the site.  The duration, scope, and
   public key for the protected scope, are used as input to 'md5sum'.
   This sum is then encrypted with RSA using the CA's private key.  The

[RFC 2165](/doc/html/rfc2165)               Service Location Protocol               June 1997

   radix 64 encoding of this is added to the mail-safe string based
   certificate encoding defined in [Appendix B](#appendix-B).

   The certificate, say for the protected scope "CONTROLLED" could be
   made available to the mobile node.  For example, it might be on a web
   page.  The mobile node could then process the certificate in order to
   obtain the public key for the CONTROLLED scope.  There is still no
   reason to *trust* this key is really the one to use (as in [Appendix](#appendix-C)
   [C](#appendix-C)).  To trust it, calculate the md5 checksum of the ascii encoded
   certificate, excluding the cert-digest.  Next, decrypt the cert-
   digest using the CA's public key and RSA. If the cert-digest matches
   the output of MD5, the certificate may be trusted (until it expires).

   The mobile node requires only one key (CA-key) in order to obtain
   others dynamically and make use of protected scopes.  Notice that we
   do not define any method for access control by arbitrary UAs to SAs
   in protected scopes.

[E](#appendix-E). Appendix:  For Further Reading

   Three related resource discovery protocols are NBP and ZIP which are
   part of the AppleTalk protocol family [[12](#ref-12)], the Legato Resource
   Administration Platform [[25](#ref-25)], and the Xerox Clearinghouse system
   [[20](#ref-20)].  Domain names and representation of addresses are used
   extensively in the Service Location Protocol.  The references for
   these are RFCs 1034 and 1035 [[17](#ref-17), [18](#ref-18)].  Example of a discovery
   protocol for routers include Router Discovery [[10](#ref-10)] and Neighbor
   Discovery [[19](#ref-19)].

This document **(000021051)** is provided subject to the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the end of this document.

### Environment

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15
SUSE Manager Server

### Situation

Security researchers Pedro Umbelino at Bitsight and Marco Lux at Curesec have published a new network traffic amplification attack using the SLP protocol, which allow amplification up to 2200 times, allowing very effective distributed denial of service attacks.

This flaw is a network protocol design flaw, a software fix is not easily possible.

SUSE ships the openslp service that offers this protocol.
### Resolution

The SLP protocol IP ports 427, both UDP and TCP, outside of your network boundary should be blocked or filtered.

### Status

Security Alert

Greetings from the VMware Security Response Center!

Today we wanted to address CVE-2023-29552 – a vulnerability in SLP that could allow for a reflective denial-of-service amplification attack that was disclosed on April 25th, 2023.

VMware has investigated this vulnerability and determined that currently supported ESXi releases (ESXi 7.x and 8.x lines) are not impacted.

However, releases that have reached end of general support (EOGS) such as 6.7 and 6.5 have been found to be impacted by CVE-2023-29552. As per previous guidance and best practice VMware recommends that the best option to address CVE-2023-29552 is to upgrade to a supported release line that is not impacted by the vulnerability. ESXi 7.0 U2c and newer, and ESXi 8.0 GA and newer, ship with the SLP service hardened, disabled by default, and filtered by the ESXi firewall. In lieu of an upgrade to a supported release, ESXi admins should ensure that their ESXi hosts are not exposed to untrusted networks and also disable SLP following the instructions in [KB76372](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/76372).

VMware would like to thank Bitsight and CISA for reporting this vulnerability to us.

# CVE-2023-29552 Service Location Protocol-Denial of Service Amplification Attack

Author: Marco Lux

Date: 2023-04-25 15:20:55

In 2019 Pedro Umbelino and myself (Marco Lux) figured that we had made attempts to research DoS issues with the Service Location Protocol. Each of us stumbled by accident across that protocol.Â  Myself during ongoing failures regarding an installation of an HP Printer to the local network and Pedro by skimming through RFCs.

Quickly we found that the results we had are common and decided to correlate the data to publish it in the near future. As it turned out, the near future was several years later. While collecting the evidence in 2023 we recognized the #ESXi attack by a random-ransomware group. We decided it is time to publish our results which cumulated in [CVE-2023-29552](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29552).

We do pretty much doubt that we are the first constructing lab-wise an attack scenario, concluding that protocol is a valuable asset for an attacker in regard of OSINT and DoS. However, we are the first talking about the latter one.

## What is SLP

SLP - which stands for Service Location Protocol - has been instantiated in 1997 and since then enhanced in five additional RFCs. It has two different protocol versions, both have been seen in the wild. There are three different SLP components:

* User-Agents (UA) - Clients
* Service Agents (SA) - Register/DeRegister Services
* Directory Agents (DA)Â  - Advertise Services

In our scenario we will mostly ignore the ideas of UA,SA and DA. Simply because the overall concepts of UA and SA are close to each other. With the difference that normally SAs should register/deregister services. In essence we will consider mainly User Agents as client(the attacker) and the Directory Agents as the remote server side enabled SLP node.

Having a glance into *RFC 2165* from June *1997* the abstract states:

"The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the discovery and selection of network services. Using this protocol, computers using the Internet no longer need so much static configuration of network services for network-based applications.

This is especially important as computers become more portable, and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system administration."

And from the Introduction in the same paper:

"Service Location provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for applications in local area networks. It is not a global resolution system for the entire Internet; rather it is intended to serve enterprise networks with shared services.Â  Applications are modeled as clients that need to find servers attached to the enterprise network at a possibly distant location.Â For cases where there are many different clients and/or services available, the protocol is
adapted to make use of nearby Directory Agents that offer a centralized repository for advertised services."

Reading this, it instantly reminds services like UPNP, SSDP, MDNS, Directory Services or even DHCP with special options for finding certain devices or services in the network. It becomes clear that the protocol was thought of being an address book for internal services in networks.

Addressing:

* suited for dynamic configuration ... in *local area* networks
* **not** a global resolution system for the entire internet

The truth however is, that SLP can be found in the internet. Several products are publicly serving SLP using TCP and UDP.

## How does the protocol work

Generally speaking, SLP was thought for usage in local area networks, thus one of its main capabilities is communication via multicast. As a result, a node will send regular updates and requests to discover neighbors,de/register them. This information can also be gathered by clients. However, the protocol also supports unicast access, which allows direct communication also outside of the multicast domain.

Taken that into account, a user agent of any type can request a service overview or try to register one if a valid IP address is known. This enables also the communication with SLP daemons over the internet and makes this protocol interesting for abuse.

To identify a remote system running SLP as service it is possible to use an onboard tool of OpenSLP or a published research tool from here [us](https://github.com/curesec/slpscan). This tool is interesting, as it also allows threaded scanning if you need to evaluate a bigger region.

./slpscan.py -m svc\_req\_v2 -l 10.0.0.4
PKT: b'\x02\x01\x00\x00!\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x96\xdb\x00\x02en\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07default\x00\x00\x00\x00'
Hostmode: 10.0.0.4
Targets: 1
[RAW] ['10.0.0.4:427', "b'\\x02\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x96\\xdb\\x00\\x02en\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'"]

The request packet looks like this:

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_service_request_v2.png "A service request is sent to the victim system, to gather if slp is available")

And the corresponding response:

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_service_reply_v2.png "A reply is sent to the attacker")

With such a request, it is possible to discover SLP services in the local network, as well as around the world.

## How does the attack work

Most attacks in regard of DoS Amplification with UDP protocols work the following way:

* Find a service with that particular protocol (e.g. NTP, DNS, SNMP)
* Spoof a request to that service with the victim IP as origin
* Continuously send packets as long as the victim shall receive packets

To create an amplification attack, the request and the response must differ in size. The smaller the request and the bigger the response, the higher the amplification. Also, those variables, while maybe obvious for most readers, are important for the attacker himself. An attack cost, decreases with smaller request size and raises costs and impact at the victim.Â

Using the described default approach, it is possible to gain an amplification factor between 1.6x and 12x times.

[+] Sending service type request v2...
[+] Data Buffer: b'\x02\n\x00\x000\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xeb\xaa\x00\x02en\x00\x00\x00\x1cservice:VMwareInfrastructure'
[!] Host: 10.0.0.4 Buffer Size: 48 Ampfactor: 1.6551724137931034

But **SLP is special**, as it allows an unauthenticated user, to **register arbitrary services** at the side of the DA. After a successful registration, the new service is announced as well. While this is intended behavior, it suites perfectly for an amplification attack. As we **can increase** - in the setup phase - the **response size dramatically**.Â

Taking this fact into account the attack scheme for a highly amplified attack with SLP would look like:

* Find a service with SLP supported - Recon
* Verify it allows registration of new services - Setup Phase
* Register services, until SLP denies more entries - Setup Phase
* Check response size - Finalize
* Create spoofed packet-stream with the victim as the origin - Attack

One Request (1), several replies (2).

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_one_request_several_reply.png "Multiple big replies after one request")

This approach is able to amplify one request up to 2200 times at the response. This renders SLP one of the top attack vectors when it comes to Denial of Service Amplification attacks.

However, it is necessary to note that **not every** SLP listening service is affected in the same way. During our research we have found different behavior, depending on product, vendor or version. Please take those into account during testing your own:

* Some do **NOT** allow registration of extra services at all.
* Some have a maximum registration buffer, if this is crossed the answer packets might be much smaller as beforehand registered services. However, those buffers are deterministic and can be enumerated during the setup phase.
* Services that happily responding with big bytes packets.

## Practical Attack Example

In recon phase a target needs to be identified. For this a SLP version 2 service type request can be used. This is a normal request and will show all registered services if any available at the remote site. In this particular example the used language is "en" and the scope "DEFAULT".

To register a service the service registration opcode and corresponding fields are used.

* Service Registration Request is send, with the data to hold in its buffer
* SLP Daemon answers with Service Acknowledge

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_service_request_v2.png "A service request is sent to the victim system, to gather if slp is available")

Check the size and add data with a normal Service Type Request, here the response:

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_pasted.png)

Send a spoofed packet, to force the daemon sending a response to the victim:

![](/blog/images/slp_dos/slp_spoofed.png "Send a spoofed packet, to instruct the reflector sending the response to the victim.")

All the steps, besides sending a spoofed packet, can be accomplished by using [slpload](https://github.com/curesec/slpload/). Use the options `check`, `load-test` and `one-shot`.

Single load packet stored at remote slpd:
python slpload.py -t 2 -l  -m one-shot
Loop and try to load up the remote slpd until its filled. Use option -m "load-test":
python slpload.py -t 2 -l  -m load-test -s 1200 -T 1000
Check data stored at remote site, print data and size plus amplification factor:
python slpload.py -t 2 -l  -m check
IPV6 Support: Can you enabled by -6
./slpload.py -6 -l
NOTE: -s Minimum size is 30 bytes, otherwise calculation gets incorrect. This is related to the
svc url / svc type fields necessary for registration. Also try to have size ~100 bytes less than
the MTU to avoid fragmentation. A safe maximum value is ~1300.

## Defense Mechanism

It is our thesis that most systems reachable with SLP are not serving by purpose but mistake. As a result the first step is to disable it. If this is not possible adding a blocking firewall ruleset for tcp/udp at port 427 can be done. Last but not the least, SLP configuration might allow disabling registration of extra services without authentication or signed messages. If all above steps fail and your vendor has no hints - good luck.

## Known devices publicly facing SLP

Interestingly, internet search engines like shodan, still missing SLP in their collection, which is a pity. Early numbers in february 2023 showed 54.000 devices. Research of todays device alive revealed that at least 34.000 systems available with SLP and prone to the attack.

Find a table with the known amplification numbers:

| Product/Vendor | Amplification Factor |
| --- | --- |
| Planex Routers | 2200x |
| IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM) | 2200x |
| Konica Minolta printers | 1180x |
| VMWare ESXi hypervisor | 300x |
| SMC IPMI | ? |
 HP Printers | ? |

## Comparing the attack

SLP is far from being alone when it comes to DoS amplification potential in network protocols. However, being quite cost effective abuse and pure amplification factor, it could be arguably the most powerful we know so far. While memcached has also quite an amplification factor (10k-50k), a check at memcached identified systems showed, that most of them do not support UDP anymore. Which renders an abuse not that effective.

Alert
# Abuse of the Service Location Protocol May Lead to DoS Attacks

Release DateApril 25, 2023

The Service Location Protocol (SLP, [RFC 2608](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2165.html)) allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to register arbitrary services. This could allow an attacker to use [spoofed UDP traffic](/news-events/alerts/2014/01/17/udp-based-amplification-attacks) to conduct a denial-of-service (DoS) attack with a significant amplification factor.

Researchers from [Bitsight and Curesec](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/new-high-severity-vulnerability-cve-2023-29552-discovered-service-location-protocol-slp) have discovered a way to abuse SLP—identified as [CVE-2023-29552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29552)—to conduct high amplification factor DoS attacks using spoofed source addresses.

As noted by Bitsight, many SLP services visible on the internet appear to be older and likely abandoned systems. Administrators should consider disabling or restricting network access to SLP servers. Some organizations such as VMware have evaluated CVE-2023-29552 and have provided a response, see [VMware Response to CVE-2023-29552 – reflective Denial-of-Service (DoS) amplification vulnerability in SLP](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2023/04/vmware-response-to-cve-2023-29552-reflective-denial-of-service-dos-amplification-vulnerability-in-slp.html) for more information.

CISA urges organizations to review [Bitsight’s blog post](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/new-high-severity-vulnerability-cve-2023-29552-discovered-service-location-protocol-slp) for more details and see CISA’s article on [Understanding and Responding to Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks](/sites/default/files/publications/understanding-and-responding-to-ddos-attacks_508c.pdf) for guidance on reducing the likelihood and impact of DoS attacks.

# SLPLOAD

Testtool for amplification factor of slpd daemon.

## Usage

### Show all modes

With the -m? option you can list all supported modes.

```
./slpload.py -m?
Supported modes:

        one-shot - load one-time data into svc
        load-test - try to load as much data as possible to service and calc ampfactor
        check - check data in default registry

```

### Test the maximum size of remote slpd buffer

Load test until remote buffer is filled. The command sets the buffer fillup to 1250bytes, registered lifetime to 10000 seconds and a timeout of 2s.

./slpload.py -T 10000 -s 1250 -t 2 -l 192.168.0.109 -m load-test

### Send one fillup request only, 512 bytes payload, 1 second timeout and 60 seconds registered lifetime

```
./slpload.py -T 60 -s 512 -t 1 -l 192.168.0.110 -m one-shot
[+] Preparing packet
[+] Sending packet Register V2...
[+] Registration accepted.
[+] Loaded up with 579 bytes

```

### Check remote registered data

```
./slpload.py -l 192.168.0.110 -m check
[+] Sending service type  request v2...
[+] Data Buffer:
b'\x02\n\x00\x02C\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x83\xf8\x00\x02en\x00\x00\x02/service:VMwareInfrastructure,service:wbem:https,slpLoadTest://alF4yQIL:31337/Y40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3utbdZ7Vvhi5qs9fW7NyjrQqTZxjNK8pHY40iEypDw8zSKwZPg3tuyrjnpLrGkuYH1GQyDuQgQC4EEAYE8Nf5hKVufZkboVoxLZNxhPYUH4WAqbfqQyGpg4jVSfUR6HX3ut'
[!] Host: 192.168.0.110 Buffer Size: 579 Ampfactor: 19.96551724137931

```

## Outro

On some devices / SLP implementations, the daemon stops filling the buffer after a certain point and either maintains the size or reverts to some default value.
For a DoS amplification attack and in order to optimize the amplification to the maximum an attacker just has to adjust the payload size for the device he is populating.

May the packets be with you.
