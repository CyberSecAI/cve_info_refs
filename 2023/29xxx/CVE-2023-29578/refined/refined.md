The provided content relates to CVE-2023-29578.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `mp4v2::impl::MP4StringProperty::~MP4StringProperty()` destructor within the mp4v2 library. This occurs when processing a crafted MP4 file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow
- The vulnerability is located at `src/mp4property.cpp:338:17`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash of the application processing the MP4 file.
- Potentially, this could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a maliciously crafted MP4 file using `mp4info` tool or other applications using the vulnerable `mp4v2` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted MP4 file to a user or system that uses the vulnerable library.
- The attacker has to craft the MP4 file such that it triggers the heap-buffer-overflow in the destructor of `MP4StringProperty`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue has been identified as a duplicate of CVE-2018-17236 and is already fixed in `enzo1982/mp4v2` and `MP4v2 2.1.0` by commit `enzo1982/mp4v2@35c20e02`.
- The provided ASAN output includes the full call stack of the crash, indicating how the destructor of `MP4StringProperty` was reached, and the location of the overflow, including the allocation and shadow bytes.
