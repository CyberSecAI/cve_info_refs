  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo due to newline characters in directory names within untrusted modules.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization leading to code injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Unexpected behavior when running a Go program that uses cgo, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploiting the `go` command's processing of cgo code with specially crafted module directory names containing newline characters.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to provide a malicious Go module with directory names containing newline characters. The vulnerability can be exploited by building untrusted code.",
     "vulnerable_code": "The go command generates code based on the directory names of modules which may lead to code injection if the directory names contain newline characters. Modules that are retrieved using GOPATH-mode i.e GO111MODULE=off may be affected"
