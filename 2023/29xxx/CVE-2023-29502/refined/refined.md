The provided content is related to CVE-2023-29502.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the “resourceDirectory” attribute within the appConfig.json file. This allows a user to modify the attribute to point to an arbitrary path before importing a project into Vuforia Studio.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application allows the user to specify a path that can lead to locations outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with high privileges and user interaction to achieve the following:
- Information Disclosure: Gain access to sensitive information located on the file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to modify the “resourceDirectory” attribute within the appConfig.json file before importing the project into Vuforia Studio.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have high privileges and must be able to interact with the application by importing a project file.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the appConfig.json file before importing it into Vuforia Studio.
