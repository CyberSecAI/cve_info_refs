# Enterprise Server 3.5 release notes

## Enterprise Server 3.5.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.19/download)

June 20, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.19: Security fixes](#3.5.19-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from [2.40.1](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/).
* If a user's request to the instance's API included authentication credentials within a URL parameter, administrators could see the credentials in JSON within the instance's audit log.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.19: Bug fixes](#3.5.19-bugs)

* If an administrator updated the instance's TLS certificate using the Management Console API's [Set settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console) endpoint, sending the certificate and key data as a URL query parameter resulted in the data appearing unmasked in system logs.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
### [3.5.19: Changes](#3.5.19-changes)

* If a configuration runs fails due to Elasticsearch errors, `ghe-config-apply` displays a more actionable error message.
### [3.5.19: Known issues](#3.5.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

  If you're unable to upgrade, or if you need further assistance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-14]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
## Enterprise Server 3.5.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.18/download)

May 30, 2023

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.18: Bug fixes](#3.5.18-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes.
* If an instance has tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 can take longer than expected. To decrease the risk of a long-running upgrade, before upgrading, someone with administrative SSH access to the instance can run the `ghe-purge-deleted-repositories` script. **Warning**: You cannot restore a purged repository. Use the script with caution. For assistance using the script, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket).
* If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.5.18: Changes](#3.5.18-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`.
### [3.5.18: Known issues](#3.5.18-known-issues)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog.
### [3.5.17: Bug fixes](#3.5.17-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instances list of organizations.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* The `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts were incorrectly set as `false` when branch protections did exist.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.5.17: Changes](#3.5.17-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.

### [3.5.16: Changes](#3.5.16-changes)

* To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each node matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field.
* If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
### [3.5.16: Known issues](#3.5.16-known-issues)

## Enterprise Server 3.5.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.15/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.15: Security fixes](#3.5.15-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.5.15: Bug fixes](#3.5.15-bugs)

* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file, pull requests in the repository intermittently failed to display the files validity or updated code owner information, requiring the user to reload the page.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.5.15: Changes](#3.5.15-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
### [3.5.15: Known issues](#3.5.15-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements.

## Enterprise Server 3.5.12

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.12](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.12/download)

February 02, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.12: Security fixes](#3.5.12-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.12: Bug fixes](#3.5.12-bugs)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* When enabling automatic TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt, the process could fail with the error `The certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or the certificate chain in missing intermediate CA signing certificates`.
### [3.5.12: Changes](#3.5.12-changes)

* When a timeout occurs during diff generation, such as when a commit displays an error that the diff is taking too long to generate, the `push` webhook event will deliver empty diff information. Previously, the `push` webhook event would fail to be delivered.
### [3.5.12: Known issues](#3.5.12-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

### [3.5.9: Security fixes](#3.5.9-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
* **HIGH**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin access for a repository. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.0. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23741).
* **MEDIUM**: An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed private repositories to be added to a GitHub Actions runner group via the API by a user who did not have access to those repositories, resulting in the repository names being shown in the UI. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the GHES instance, permissions to modify GitHub Actions runner groups, and successfully guess the obfuscated ID of private repositories. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46257).
### [3.5.9: Bug fixes](#3.5.9-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* The `member` webhook event did not include the `from` and `to` field values for the `permission` field as part of the `changes` field.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* If a user uploaded more than one file while creating a new Gist, the user could not delete any files uploaded after the first.
* A debug-level message appeared in a system log, which could consume space rapidly on the instance's root storage volume.

This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23737](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23737).
* **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.7: Bug fixes](#3.5.7-bugs)

* After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
* After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
* When a user accessed a renamed repository using Git, the hostname in the Git output incorrectly indicated GitHub.com instead of the instance's hostname.
* On instances using LDAP authentication and LDAP sync, sync would fail and print `undefined method ord for nil:NilClass` in `ldap-sync.log`.
* Addressed a bug in which the endpoint for [creating a tag protection state for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/repos/tags#create-a-tag-protection-state-for-a-repository) was returning a 500 error.

* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning alerts did not include a provider type, and instead indicated that the provider type was "unknown."
### [3.5.7: Changes](#3.5.7-changes)

* To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements. The check also verifies Elasticsearch's health. You can review the current requirements for CPU, memory, and storage for GitHub Enterprise Server in the "Minimum requirements" section within each article in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."

### [3.5.6: Features](#3.5.6-features)

* Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field.
### [3.5.6: Security fixes](#3.5.6-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
* **MEDIUM**: The use of a Unicode right-to-left override character in the list of accessible files for a GitHub App could obscure additional files that the app could access.
* **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.6: Bug fixes](#3.5.6-bugs)

* Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
* Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
* The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation.
* In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
* Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
* When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
* In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
* A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
* After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
* After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5, releases would appear to be missing from repositories. This occurred when the required Elasticsearch index migrations had not successfully completed. The releases UI now indicates if it is waiting for the Elasticsearch index migrations to complete, and links to documentation on how to observe status and immediately complete the migration.
* Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
* When viewing a pull request's diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
* On instances using GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning automatically revoked personal access tokens added to public repositories.
* Repositories for packages erroneously displayed a "Used by" section.

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.6 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

## Enterprise Server 3.5.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.5/download)

August 30, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.5.5: Bug fixes](#3.5.5-bugs)

* After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository.
* Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* The site admin page for individual users at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/admin` contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster.
* In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error.
* After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear.
* The site admin bar at the top of the web interface contained a broken link to the SHA for the currently running version of the application.
* In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
* Alerts from secret scanning for GitHub Advanced Security customers were missing in the web UI and REST API if a site administrator did not upgrade directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The alerts are now visible.
* When a user forked a repository into an organization, a long list of organizations would not render properly.
### [3.5.5: Changes](#3.5.5-changes)

* Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
* APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.
* The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."
* In some cases, cache replicas could reject some Git operations on recently updated repositories. For more information about repository caching, see "[About repository caching](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."
### [3.5.5: Known issues](#3.5.5-known-issues)

### [3.5.4: Security fixes](#3.5.4-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL**: GitHub Enterprise Server's Elasticsearch container used a version of OpenJDK 8 that was vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. The vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2022-34169](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9339-86wc-4qgf).
* **HIGH**: Previously installed apps on user accounts were automatically granted permission to access an organization on scoped access tokens after the user account was transformed into an organization account. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
### [3.5.4: Bug fixes](#3.5.4-bugs)

* In some cases, GitHub Enterprise Server instances on AWS that used the `r4.4xlarge` instance type would fail to boot.
* In some cases, UI elements within a pull request's **Files changed** tab could overlap.
* When a custom dormancy threshold was set for the instance, suspending all dormant users did not reliably respect the threshold. For more information about dormancy, see "[Managing dormant users](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)."
* When calculating committers for GitHub Advanced Security, it was not possible to specify individual repositories. For more information, see "[Site admin dashboard](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard#advanced-security-committers)."
* In some cases, Elasticsearch's post-upgrade `es:upgrade` process could crash before completion.
* The script for migration to internal repositories failed to convert the visibility for public repositories to internal or private. For more information about the migration, see "[Migrating to internal repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/user-management/managing-repositories-in-your-enterprise/migrating-to-internal-repositories)."
* Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3, but is now available in 3.5.4. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph#supported-package-ecosystems)."

* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."

### [3.5.2: Security fixes](#3.5.2-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Prevents an attack where an `org` query string parameter can be specified for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL that then gives access to another organization's active committers.
* **MEDIUM**: Ensures that `github.company.com` and `github-company.com` are not evaluated by internal services as identical hostnames, preventing a potential server-side security forgery (SSRF) attack.
* **LOW**: An attacker could access the Management Console with a path traversal attack via HTTP even if external firewall rules blocked HTTP access.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.5.2: Bug fixes](#3.5.2-bugs)

* Files inside an artifact archive were unable to be opened after decompression due to restrictive permissions.
* In some cases, packages pushed to the Container registry were not visible in GitHub Enterprise Server's web UI.
* Management Console would appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.
* Redis timeouts no longer halt database migrations while running `ghe-config-apply`.
* Background job processors would get stuck in a partially shut-down state, resulting in certain kinds of background jobs (like code scanning) appearing stuck.
* In some cases, site administrators were not automatically added as enterprise owners.
* Actions workflows calling other reusable workflows failed to run on a schedule.
* Resolving Actions using GitHub Connect failed briefly after changing repository visibility from public to internal.
### [3.5.2: Changes](#3.5.2-changes)

* Improved the performance of Dependabot Updates when first enabled.
* Increase maximum concurrent connections for Actions runners to support [the GHES performance target](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server#review-hardware-requirements).
* The GitHub Pages build and synchronization timeouts are now configurable in the Management Console.
* Added environment variable to configure Redis timeouts.
* Creating or updating check runs or check suites could return `500 Internal Server Error` if the value for certain fields, like the name, was too long.
* Improves performance in pull requests' "Files changed" tab when the diff includes many changes.
* The Actions repository cache usage policy no longer accepts a maximum value less than 1 for [`max_repo_cache_size_limit_in_gb`](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/actions/cache#set-github-actions-cache-usage-policy-for-an-enterprise).
* When [deploying cache-server nodes](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/configuring-a-repository-cache#configuring-a-repository-cache), it is now mandatory to describe the datacenter topology (using the `--datacenter` argument) for every node in the system. This requirement prevents situations where leaving datacenter membership set to "default" leads to workloads being inappropriately balanced across multiple datacenters.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
### [3.5.2: Known issues](#3.5.2-known-issues)

* In HA configurations where Elasticsearch reported a valid yellow status, changes introduced in a previous fix would block the `ghe-repl-stop` command and not allow replication to be stopped. Using `ghe-repo-stop --force` will now force Elasticsearch to stop when the service is in a normal or valid yellow status.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
### [3.5.1: Known issues](#3.5.1-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]
* Management Console may appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* The following features were unavailable for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The features are available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]

  + Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph
  + Reopening of dismissed Dependabot alerts
  + Enabling the **Update branch** button for all pull requests in a repository
  + Light high contrast theme
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) patch release. [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.5.0/download)

May 31, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.5.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.5.0: Features](#3.5.0-features)

* #### [IP exception list for validation testing after maintenance](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#ip-exception-list-for-validation-testing-after-maintenance)
* You can now configure an allow list of IP addresses that can access application services on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance while maintenance mode is enabled. Administrators who visit the instance's web interface from an allowed IP address can validate the instance's functionality post-maintenance and before disabling maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#validating-changes-in-maintenance-mode-using-the-ip-exception-list)."
* #### [Custom repository roles are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#custom-repository-roles-are-generally-available)
* With custom repository roles, organizations now have more granular control over the repository access permissions they can grant to users. For more information, see "[Managing custom repository roles for an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization)."

  A custom repository role is created by an organization owner, and is available across all repositories in that organization. Each role can be given a custom name, and a description. It can be configured from a set of over 40 fine grained permissions. Once created, repository admins can assign a custom role to any user, team or outside collaborator in their repository.

  Custom repository roles can be created, viewed, edited and deleted via the new **Repository roles** tab in an organization's settings. A maximum of 3 custom roles can be created within an organization.

  Custom repository roles are also fully supported in the GitHub Enterprise Server REST APIs. The Organizations API can be used to list all custom repository roles in an organization, and the existing APIs for granting repository access to individuals and teams have been extended to support custom repository roles. For more information, see "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/reference/orgs#list-custom-repository-roles-in-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Container registry in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#github-container-registry-in-public-beta)
* The GitHub Container registry (GHCR) is now available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 as a public beta, offering developers the ability to publish, download, and manage containers. GitHub Packages container support implements the OCI standards for hosting Docker images. For more information, see "[GitHub Container registry](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)."
* #### [Dependabot updates are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#dependabot-updates-are-generally-available)
* Dependabot version and security updates are now generally available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. All the popular ecosystems and features that work on GitHub.com repositories now can be set up on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. Dependabot on GitHub Enterprise Server requires GitHub Actions and a pool of self-hosted Dependabot runners, GitHub Connect enabled, and Dependabot enabled by an admin. For more information, see "[Setting up Dependabot updates](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/setting-up-dependabot-updates)."
* #### [Server Statistics in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#server-statistics-in-public-beta)
* You can now analyze how your team works, understand the value you get from GitHub Enterprise Server, and help us improve our products by reviewing your instance's usage data and sharing this aggregate data with GitHub. You can use your own tools to analyze your usage over time by downloading your data in a CSV or JSON file or by accessing it using the REST API. To see the list of aggregate metrics collected, see "[About Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics/about-server-statistics#server-statistics-data-collected)." Server Statistics data includes no personal data nor GitHub content, such as code, issues, comments, or pull requests content. For a better understanding of how we store and secure Server Statistics data, see "[GitHub Security](https://github.com/security)." For more information about Server Statistics, see "[Analyzing how your team works with Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics)." This feature is available in public beta.
* #### [GitHub Actions rate limiting is now configurable](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#github-actions-rate-limiting-is-now-configurable)
* Site administrators can now enable and configure a rate limit for GitHub Actions. By default, the rate limit is disabled. When workflow jobs cannot immediately be assigned to an available runner, they will wait in a queue until a runner is available. However, if GitHub Actions experiences a sustained high load, the queue can back up faster than it can drain and the performance of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance may degrade. To avoid this, an administrator can configure a rate limit. When the rate limit is exceeded, additional workflow runs will fail immediately rather than being put in the queue. Once the rate has stabilized below the threshold, new runs can be queued again. For more information, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits#configuring-rate-limits-for-github-actions)."
* #### [OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure deployments with GitHub Actions](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#openid-connect-oidc-for-secure-deployments-with-github-actions)
* GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server now supports OIDC for secure deployments to cloud providers, which uses short-lived tokens that are automatically rotated for each deployment. OIDC enables the following functionality.

  + Seamless authentication between cloud providers and GitHub Enterprise Server without the need for storing any long-lived cloud secrets on your instance
  + Cloud administrators can rely on the security mechanisms of a particular cloud provider to ensure that GitHub Actions workflows have minimal access to cloud resources. There is no duplication of secret management between GitHub Enterprise Server and the cloud.

  For more information, see "[Security hardening your deployments](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments)."
* #### [Sharing GitHub Actions within your enterprise is generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#sharing-github-actions-within-your-enterprise-is-generally-available)
* Support for GitHub Actions in internal repositories is now generally available for organizations on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. You can innersource automation by sharing actions in internal repositories. You can manage a repository's settings or use the REST API to allow access to workflows in other repositories within the organization or in any organization on the instance. For more information, see "[Sharing actions and workflows with your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/creating-actions/sharing-actions-and-workflows-with-your-enterprise)," "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-access-to-components-in-an-internal-repository)," and "[Actions Permissions](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/actions/permissions#get-the-level-of-access-for-workflows-outside-of-the-repository)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Cache support for GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server is now generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#cache-support-for-github-actions-on-github-enterprise-server-is-now-generally-available)
* You can now use dependency caching to speed up your GitHub Actions workflows. To cache dependencies for a job, you can include the [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action to create a cache with a unique key. You can share caches across all workflows in the same repository. These workflows can then restore the cache and run faster.

  Actions users can also use our cache APIs to:

  + Define the enterprise policy for cache size range allowed per repository.
  + Query the cache usage within each repository and monitor if the total size of all caches is reaching the upper limit.
  + Increase the maximum cache size for a repository within the allowed enterprise limits, based on the cache requirements of the repository.
  + Monitor aggregate cache usage at organization level or at enterprise level.

  The external blob storage that is configured within your enterprise account will now be shared across workflow artifacts, logs, and also the caches. For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)."
* #### [Automatically sign commits made in the web UI](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#automatically-sign-commits-made-in-the-web-ui)
* You can now configure GitHub Enterprise Server to automatically sign commits made in the web interface, such as from editing a file or merging a pull request. Signed commits increase confidence that changes come from trusted sources. This feature allows the [Require signed commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-signed-commits) branch protection setting to block unsigned commits from entering a repository, while allowing entry of signed commits – even those made in the web interface. For more information, see "[Configuring web commit signing](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-web-commit-signing)."
* #### [Sync license usage any time](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#sync-license-usage-any-time)
* For customers that sync license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud automatically using GitHub Connect, you now have the ability to sync your license usage independently of the automatic weekly sync. This feature also reports the status of sync job. For more information, see "[Syncing license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud#manually-syncing-license-usage)."
* #### [Reusable workflows for GitHub Actions are generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#reusable-workflows-for-github-actions-are-generally-available)
* Reusable workflows are now generally available. Reusable workflows help you reduce duplication by enabling you to reuse an entire workflow as if it were an action. With the general availability release, a number of improvements are now available for GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)."

  + You can utilize outputs to pass data from reusable workflows to other jobs in the caller workflow.
  + You can pass environment secrets to reusable workflows.
  + The audit log includes information about which reusable workflows are used.
  + Reusable workflows in the same repository as the calling repository can be referenced with just the path and filename (`PATH/FILENAME`). The called workflow will be from the same commit as the caller workflow.
* #### [Self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions can now disable automatic updates](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#self-hosted-runners-for-github-actions-can-now-disable-automatic-updates)
* You now have more control over when your self-hosted runners perform software updates. If you specify the `--disableupdate` flag to the runner then it will not try to perform an automatic software update if a newer version of the runner is available. This allows you to update the self-hosted runner on your own schedule, and is especially convenient if your self-hosted runner is in a container.

  For compatibility with the GitHub Actions service, you will need to manually update your runner within 30 days of a new runner version being available. For instructions on how to install the latest runner version, please see the installation instructions for [the latest release in the runner repo](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases).
* #### [Secure self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions by limiting workflows](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#secure-self-hosted-runners-for-github-actions-by-limiting-workflows)
* Organization owners can now increase the security of CI/CD workflows on self-hosted runners by choosing which workflows can access a runner group. Previously, any workflow in a repository, such as an issue labeler, could access the self-hosted runners available to an organization. For more information, see "[Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-what-workflows-can-access-a-runner-group)" and the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-03-23-github-actions-secure-self-hosted-runners-specific-workflows/).
* #### [Prevent GitHub Actions from approving pull requests](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#prevent-github-actions-from-approving-pull-requests)
* You can now control whether GitHub Actions can approve pull requests. This feature protects against a user using GitHub Actions to satisfy the "Required approvals" branch protection requirement and merging a change that was not reviewed by another user. To prevent breaking existing workflows, **Allow GitHub Actions reviews to count towards required approval** is enabled by default. Organization owners can disable the feature in the organization's GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#preventing-github-actions-from-approving-pull-requests)."
* #### [Re-run failed or individual GitHub Actions jobs](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#re-run-failed-or-individual-github-actions-jobs)
* You can now re-run only failed jobs or an individual job in a GitHub Actions workflow run. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)."
* #### [Dependency graph supports GitHub Actions](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#dependency-graph-supports-github-actions)
* The dependency graph now detects YAML files for GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub Enterprise Server will display the workflow files within the **Insights** tab's dependency graph section. Repositories that publish actions will also be able to see the number of repositories that depend on that action from the "Used By" control on the repository homepage. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

  + **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]
* #### [Security overview for enterprises in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#security-overview-for-enterprises-in-public-beta)

* The new `DependabotUpdate` GraphQL object lets you view information about what happens to your repository's security updates. When GitHub Enterprise Server detects that a dependency in your repository is vulnerable, Dependabot will attempt to open a pull request to update that dependency to a non-vulnerable version. You can now see the pull request that fixes the vulnerability. In some cases, Dependabot fails to open a pull request. Previously, the error message that Dependabot generated was only visible in the "Dependabot Alerts" section of the **Security** tab. Now, if Dependabot runs into an error when trying to open a pull request for a security alert, you can determine the reason using the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#dependabotupdate)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Access more information about Dependabot alerts via GraphQL API](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#access-more-information-about-dependabot-alerts-via-graphql-api)
* You can now view fixed alerts from Dependabot with the GraphQL API. You can also access and filter by state, as well as by unique numeric identifier, and you can filter by state on the vulnerability alert object. The following fields now exist for a `RepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`.

  + `number`
  + `fixed_at`
  + `fix_reason`
  + `state`

  For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#repositoryvulnerabilityalert)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Git events in the enterprise audit log](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#git-events-in-the-enterprise-audit-log)
* The following Git-related events can now appear in the enterprise audit log. If you enable the feature and set an audit log retention period, the new events will be available for search via the UI and API, or export via JSON or CSV.

  + `git.clone`
  + `git.fetch`
  + `git.push`

  Due to the large number of Git events logged, we recommend you monitor your instance's file storage and review your related alert configurations. For more information, see "[Configuring the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/configuring-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#managing-git-events-in-the-audit-log)."
* #### [Improvements to CODEOWNERS](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#improvements-to-codeowners)
* This release includes improvements to CODEOWNERS.

  + Syntax errors are now surfaced when viewing a CODEOWNERS file from the web. Previously, when a line in a CODEOWNERS file had a syntax error, the error would be ignored or in some cases cause the entire CODEOWNERS file to not load. GitHub Apps and Actions can access the same list of errors using new REST and GraphQL APIs. For more information, see "[Repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/repos/repos#list-codeowners-errors)" in the REST API documentation or "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/graphql/reference/objects#repositorycodeowners)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
  + After someone creates a new pull request or pushes new changes to a draft pull request, any code owners that will be requested for review are now listed in the pull request under "Reviewers". This feature gives you an early look at who will be requested to review once the pull request is marked ready for review.
  + Comments in CODEOWNERS files can now appear at the end of a line, not just on dedicated lines.

  For more information, see "[About code owners](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)."
* #### [More ways to keep a pull request's topic branch up to date](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#more-ways-to-keep-a-pull-requests-topic-branch-up-to-date)
* The **Update branch** button on the pull request page lets you update your pull request's branch with the latest changes from the base branch. This is useful for verifying your changes are compatible with the current version of the base branch before you merge. Two enhancements now give you more ways to keep your branch up-to-date.

  + When your pull request's topic branch is out of date with the base branch, you now have the option to update it by rebasing on the latest version of the base branch. Rebasing applies the changes from your branch onto the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a branch with a linear history since no merge commit is created. To update by rebasing, click the drop down menu next to the **Update Branch** button, click **Update with rebase**, and then click **Rebase branch**. Previously, **Update branch** performed a traditional merge that always resulted in a merge commit in your pull request branch. This option is still available, but now you have the choice. For more information, see "[Keeping your pull request in sync with the base branch](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/keeping-your-pull-request-in-sync-with-the-base-branch)."
  + A new repository setting allows the **Update branch** button to always be available when a pull request's topic branch is not up to date with the base branch. Previously, this button was only available when the **Require branches to be up to date before merging** branch protection setting was enabled. People with admin or maintainer access can manage the **Always suggest updating pull request branches** setting from the **Pull Requests** section in repository settings. For more information, see "[Managing suggestions to update pull request branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-suggestions-to-update-pull-request-branches)."

    - **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]
* #### [Configure custom HTTP headers for GitHub Pages sites](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#configure-custom-http-headers-for-github-pages-sites)
* You can now configure custom HTTP headers that apply to all GitHub Pages sites served from your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Pages for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-github-pages-for-your-enterprise#configuring-github-pages-response-headers-for-your-enterprise)."
* #### [Ignore commits in blame view](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#ignore-commits-in-blame-view)
* It's now possible to ignore revisions in the blame view by creating a *.git-blame-ignore-revs* file in the root of your repository. For more information, see "[Viewing a file](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)."
* #### [Light high contrast theme is generally available](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#light-high-contrast-theme-is-generally-available)
* A light high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements, is now generally available. For more information, see "[Managing your theme settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/managing-your-theme-settings)."

  + **Note**: This feature was unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The feature is available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]
* #### [Tag protection rules](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#tag-protection-rules)
* Repository owners can now configure tag protection rules to protect a repository's tags. Once protected by a tag protection rule, tags matching a specified name pattern can only be created and deleted by users with the Maintain or Admin role in the repository. For more information, see "[Configuring tag protection rules](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules)."
* #### [Edit files within pull requests in GitHub Mobile for iOS](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#edit-files-within-pull-requests-in-github-mobile-for-ios)
* In GitHub Mobile for iOS 1.80.0 and later, users can now edit files within a pull request's topic branch. Support for editing files will come to GitHub Mobile for Android in a future release. [Updated: 2022-09-13]
### [3.5.0: Bug fixes](#3.5.0-bugs)

* It is now possible for GitHub Apps to upload release assets.
### [3.5.0: Changes](#3.5.0-changes)

* Minimum requirements for root storage and memory increased for GitHub Enterprise Server 2.10 and 3.0, and are now enforced as of 3.5.0.

  + In version 2.10, the minimum requirement for root storage increased from 80 GB to 200 GB. As of 3.5.0, system preflight checks will fail if the root storage is smaller than 80 GB.
  + In version 3.0, the minimum requirement for memory increased from 16 GB to 32 GB. As of 3.5.0, system preflight checks will fail if the system has less than 28 GB of memory.

  For more information, see the minimum requirements for each supported deployment platform in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)." [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
* To use the device authorization flow for OAuth and GitHub Apps, you must manually enable the feature. This change reduces the likelihood of apps being used in phishing attacks against GitHub Enterprise Server users by ensuring integrators are aware of the risks and make a conscious choice to support this form of authentication. If you own or manage an OAuth App or GitHub App and you want to use the device flow, you can enable it for your app via the app's settings page. The device flow API endpoints will respond with status code `400` to apps that have not enabled this feature. For more information, see "[Authorizing OAuth Apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow)."
* The code scanning alert page now always shows the alert status and information for the default branch. There is a new "Affected branches" panel in the sidebar where you can see the status of the alert in other branches. If the alert does not exist in your default branch, the alert page will show the status as "In branch" or "In pull request" for the location where the alert was last seen. This improvement makes it easier to understand the status of alerts which have been introduced into your code base. For more information, see "[About code scanning alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alert-details)."

  The alert list page is not changed and can be filtered by `branch`. You can use the code scanning API to retrieve more detailed branch information for alerts. For more information, see "[Code Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/rest/code-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* Code scanning now shows the details of the analysis origin of an alert. If an alert has more than one analysis origin, it is shown in the "Affected branches" sidebar and in the alert timeline. You can hover over the analysis origin icon in the "Affected branches" sidebar to see the alert status in each analysis origin. If an alert only has a single analysis origin, no information about analysis origins is displayed on the alert page. These improvements will make it easier to understand your alerts. In particular, it will help you understand those that have multiple analysis origins. This is especially useful for setups with multiple analysis configurations, such as monorepos. For more information, see "[About code scanning alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-analysis-origins)."
* Lists of repositories owned by a user or organization now have an additional filter option, "Templates", making it easier to find template repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server can display several common image formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and SVG, and provides several ways to compare differences between versions. Now when reviewing added or changed images in a pull request, previews of those images are shown by default. Previously, you would see a message indicating that binary files could not be shown and you would need to toggle the "Display rich diff" option. For more information, see "[Working with non-code files](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files)."
* New gists are now created with a default branch name of either `main` or the alternative default branch name defined in your user settings. This matches how other repositories are created on GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[About branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)" and "[Managing the default branch name for your repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)."
* Gists now only show the 30 most recent comments when first displayed. You can click **Load earlier comments...** to view more. This allows gists that have many comments to appear more quickly. For more information, see "[Editing and sharing content with gists](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists)."
* Settings pages for users, organizations, repositories, and teams have been redesigned, grouping similar settings pages into sections for improved information architecture and discoverability. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-02-02-redesign-of-githubs-settings-pages/).
* Focusing or hovering over a label now displays the label description in a tooltip.
* Creating and removing repository invitations, whether done through the API or web interface, are now subject to rate limits that may be enabled on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information about rate limits, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits)."
* MinIO has announced the removal of the MinIO Gateways starting June 1st, 2022. While MinIO Gateway for NAS continues to be one of the supported storage providers for Github Actions and Github Packages, we recommend moving to MinIO LTS support to avail support and bug fixes from MinIO. For more information about rate limits, see "[Scheduled removal of MinIO Gateway for GCS, Azure, HDFS in the minio/minio repository](https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/14331)."
### [3.5.0: Deprecations](#3.5.0-deprecations)

* #### [Change to the format of authentication tokens affects GitHub Connect](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#change-to-the-format-of-authentication-tokens-affects-github-connect)
* GitHub Connect will no longer work after June 3rd for instances running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 or older, due to the format of GitHub authentication tokens changing. To continue using GitHub Connect, upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2 or later. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-05-20-action-needed-by-github-connect-customers-using-ghes-3-1-and-older-to-adopt-new-authentication-token-format-updates/). [Updated: 2022-06-14]
* #### [CodeQL runner deprecated in favor of CodeQL CLI](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#codeql-runner-deprecated-in-favor-of-codeql-cli)
* The CodeQL runner is deprecated in favor of the CodeQL CLI. GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 and later no longer include the CodeQL runner. This deprecation only affects users who use CodeQL code scanning in 3rd party CI/CD systems. GitHub Actions users are not affected. GitHub strongly recommends that customers migrate to the CodeQL CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the CodeQL runner and has many additional features. For more information, see "[Migrating from the CodeQL runner to CodeQL CLI](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/code-security/code-scanning/using-codeql-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system/migrating-from-the-codeql-runner-to-codeql-cli)."
* #### [Theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed](/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#theme-picker-for-github-pages-has-been-removed)
* The theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed from the Pages settings. For more information about configuration of themes for GitHub Pages, see "[Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)."
### [3.5.0: Known issues](#3.5.0-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
* Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 patch release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]
* Management Console may appear stuck on the *Starting* screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. [Updated: 2022-06-20]
* The following features were unavailable for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, and 3.5.3. The features are available in 3.5.4 and later. [Updated: 2022-08-16]

  + Detection of GitHub Actions workflow files for the dependency graph
  + Reopening of dismissed Dependabot alerts
  + Enabling the **Update branch** button for all pull requests in a repository
  + Light high contrast theme
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) patch release. [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-12-07]
### [3.5.0: Errata](#3.5.0-errata)

* "[Encrypted secrets](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]

# Enterprise Server 3.4 release notes

## Enterprise Server 3.4.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.4.18/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.4.18: Security fixes](#3.4.18-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the� [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)� and has been assigned� [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the� [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)� and has been assigned� [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.4.18: Bug fixes](#3.4.18-bugs)

* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.4.18: Changes](#3.4.18-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
### [3.4.18: Known issues](#3.4.18-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.9 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

  If you're unable to upgrade, or if you need further assistance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-14]
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

  To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade). [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.

* GitHub Pages builds could time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability.
* After configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would send digest emails to suspended users.
* If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook.
* In some cases, users could not merge a pull request due to unexpected status checks.
* After running migrations for the GitHub Enterprise Importer on an instance configured for high availability, replication of migration storage assets would not catch up.
* Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container.
### [3.4.11: Known issues](#3.4.11-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

## Enterprise Server 3.4.10

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.10](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.4.10/download)

October 25, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.4.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.4.10: Security fixes](#3.4.10-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Updated dependencies for the Management Console to the latest patch versions, which addresses security vulnerabilities including [CVE-2022-30123](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wq4h-7r42-5hrr) and [CVE-2022-29181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m).
* **HIGH**: Added checks to address an improper cache key vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to access private repository files through a public repository. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-23738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23738).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated Redis to 5.0.14 to address [CVE-2021-32672](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32672) and [CVE-2021-32762](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32762).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated GitHub Actions runners to fix a bug that allowed environment variables in GitHub Actions jobs to escape the context of the variable and modify the invocation of `docker` commands directly. For more information, see the [Actions Runner security advisory](https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3).
* **MEDIUM**: An improper privilege management vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed users with improper privileges to create or delete pages via the API. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be added to an organization's repo with write permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23737](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23737).
* **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.10: Bug fixes](#3.4.10-bugs)

* After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
* After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
* When a user accessed a renamed repository using Git, the hostname in the Git output incorrectly indicated GitHub.com instead of the instance's hostname.
* Deleted assets and assets scheduled to be purged within a repository, such as LFS files, took too long to to be cleaned up.
* If a user installed a GitHub App for the user account and then converted the account into an organization, the app was not granted organization permissions.
### [3.4.10: Changes](#3.4.10-changes)

* To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements. The check also verifies Elasticsearch's health. You can review the current requirements for CPU, memory, and storage for GitHub Enterprise Server in the "Minimum requirements" section within each article in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
### [3.4.10: Known issues](#3.4.10-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

### [3.4.9: Features](#3.4.9-features)

* Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field.
### [3.4.9: Security fixes](#3.4.9-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
* **MEDIUM**: The use of a Unicode right-to-left override character in the list of accessible files for a GitHub App could obscure additional files that the app could access.
* **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.9: Bug fixes](#3.4.9-bugs)

* Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
* Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
* In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
* Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
* The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation.
* In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
* When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
* A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
* Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
* After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
* After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases would appear to be missing from repositories. This occurred when the required Elasticsearch index migrations had not successfully completed. The releases UI now indicates if it is waiting for the Elasticsearch index migrations to complete, and links to documentation on how to observe status and immediately complete the migration.
* Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
* If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* When adding a member to an organization, an erroneous SAML SSO trial invitation appeared.
### [3.4.9: Known issues](#3.4.9-known-issues)

* **MEDIUM**: A vulnerability involving deserialization of untrusted data was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could potentially lead to remote code execution on the Subversion (SVN) bridge. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to gain access via a server-side request forgery (SSRF) that would let an attacker control the data being deserialized. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23734](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23734).
### [3.4.6: Bug fixes](#3.4.6-bugs)

* In some cases, the collectd daemon could consume excess memory.
* In some cases, backups of rotated log files could accumulate and consume excess storage.
* After an upgrade to a new feature release and subsequent configuration run, Elasticsearch could log excessive exceptions while rebuilding indices.
* In some cases where a protected branch required more than one approving review, a pull request could be merged with fewer than the required number of approving reviews.
* On instances using LDAP authentication, the authentication prompt for sudo mode incorrectly placed the cursor within the password field by default when text fields for both a username and password were visible.
* In some cases, scheduled GitHub Actions workflows could become disabled.
* The Billing API's "[Billing](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/billing#get-github-advanced-security-active-committers-for-an-organization)" endpoint now returns `Link` headers to provide information about pagination.

### [3.4.5: Bug fixes](#3.4.5-bugs)

* Files inside an artifact archive were unable to be opened after decompression due to restrictive permissions.
* Redis timeouts no longer halt database migrations while running `ghe-config-apply`.
* Background job processors would get stuck in a partially shut-down state, resulting in certain kinds of background jobs (like code scanning) appearing stuck.
* In some cases, site administrators were not automatically added as enterprise owners.
* A rendering issue could affect the dropdown list for filtering secret scanning alerts in a repository.
### [3.4.5: Changes](#3.4.5-changes)

* Improved the performance of Dependabot version updates after first enabled.
* The GitHub Pages build and synchronization timeouts are now configurable in the Management Console.
* Creating or updating check runs or check suites could return `500 Internal Server Error` if the value for certain fields, like the name, was too long.
* When [deploying cache-server nodes](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/configuring-a-repository-cache#configuring-a-repository-cache), it is now mandatory to describe the datacenter topology (using the `--datacenter` argument) for every node in the system. This requirement prevents situations where leaving datacenter membership set to "default" leads to workloads being inappropriately balanced across multiple datacenters.
### [3.4.5: Known issues](#3.4.5-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

  To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade). [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]

June 09, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.4.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.4.4: Security fixes](#3.4.4-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.4: Bug fixes](#3.4.4-bugs)

* An internal script to validate hostnames in the GitHub Enterprise Server configuration file would return an error if the hostname string started with a "." (period character).
* In HA configurations where the primary node's hostname was longer than 60 characters, MySQL would fail to be configured.
* When GitHub Actions was enabled but TLS was disabled on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.1 and later, applying a configuration update would fail.
* The `--gateway` argument was added to the `ghe-setup-network` command, to allow passing the gateway address when configuring network settings using the command line.
* The [GitHub Advanced Security billing API](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/enterprise-admin/billing#get-github-advanced-security-active-committers-for-an-enterprise) endpoints were not enabled and accessible.
* Image attachments that were deleted would return a `500 Internal Server Error` instead of a `404 Not Found` error.
* In environments configured with a repository cache server, the `ghe-repl-status` command incorrectly showed gists as being under-replicated.
* The "Get a commit" and "Compare two commits" endpoints in the [Commit API](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/commits/commits) would return a `500` error if a file path in the diff contained an encoded and escaped unicode character.
* The calculation of "maximum committers across entire instance" reported in the site admin dashboard was incorrect.
* An incorrect database entry for repository replicas caused database corruption when performing a restore using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities.

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.3: Bug fixes](#3.4.3-bugs)

* In some cluster topologies, the `ghe-cluster-status` command left behind empty directories in `/tmp`.
* SNMP incorrectly logged a high number of `Cannot statfs` error messages to syslog.
* When adding custom patterns and providing non-UTF8 test strings, match highlighting was incorrect.
* LDAP users with an underscore character (`_`) in their user names can now login successfully.
* For instances configured with SAML authentication and built-in fallback enabled, built-in users would get stuck in a “login” loop when attempting to sign in from the page generated after logging out.
* After enabling SAML encrypted assertions with Azure as identity provider, the sign in page would fail with a `500` error.
* Character key shortcut preferences weren't respected.
* Attempts to view the `git fsck` output from the `/stafftools/repositories/:owner/:repo/disk` page would fail with a `500 Internal Server Error`.
* When using SAML encrypted assertions, some assertions were not correctly marking SSH keys as verified.

* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import a repository, some issues would fail to import due to incorrectly configured project timeline events.
* When using `ghe-migrator`, a migration would fail to import video file attachments in issues and pull requests.
* The Releases page would return a 500 error when the repository has tags that contain non-ASCII characters. [Updated: 2022-06-10]
* Upgrades would sometimes fail while migrating dependency graph data. [Updated: 2022-06-30]
### [3.4.3: Changes](#3.4.3-changes)

* In high availability configurations, clarify that the replication overview page in the Management Console only displays the current replication configuration, not the current replication status.
* The Nomad allocation timeout for Dependency Graph has been increased to ensure post-upgrade migrations can complete.
* When enabling GitHub Packages, clarify that using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token as connection string is not currently supported.
* Support bundles now include the row count of tables stored in MySQL.
* When determining which repository networks to schedule maintenance on, we no longer count the size of unreachable objects.
* The `run_started_at` response field is now included in the [Workflow runs API](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/actions/workflow-runs) and the `workflow_run` event webhook payload.

### [3.4.2: Security fixes](#3.4.2-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.2: Bug fixes](#3.4.2-bugs)

* Resolved a regression that could lead to consistent failures to retrieve artifacts and download log archives for GitHub Actions. In some circumstances we stopped resolving URLs for internal communications that used `localhost`, and instead incorrectly used the instance hostname.
* When a manifest file was deleted from a repository, the manifest would not be removed from the repository's "Dependency graph" page.
* Upgrading the nodes in a high availability pair with an upgrade package could cause Elasticsearch to enter an inconsistent state in some cases.
* Rotated log files with the extension `.backup` would accumulate in directories containing system logs.
* In some cluster topologies, the command line utilities `ghe-spokesctl` and `ghe-btop` failed to run.
* Elasticsearch indices could be duplicated during a package upgrade, due to an `elasticsearch-upgrade` service running multiple times in parallel.
* Repository cache servers could serve data from non-cache locations even when the data was available in the local cache location.
* When converting a user account to an organization, if the user account was an owner of the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise account, the converted organization would incorrectly appear in the enterprise owner list.
* The `/stafftools/users/ip_addresses/:address` page responded with a `500 Internal Server Error` when attempting to display the page for an IPv6 address.
* Creating an impersonation OAuth token using the Enterprise Administration REST API resulted in an error when an integration matching the OAuth Application ID already existed.

### [3.4.2: Deprecations](#3.4.2-deprecations)

* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-30)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-31)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 will be discontinued on June 3, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-xenserver-hypervisor-support)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3, GitHub Enterprise Server on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.
* #### [Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-content-attachments-api-preview)
* Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.
* #### [Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codes-of-conduct-api-preview)
* The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository's code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the GitHub changelog.
* #### [Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-oauth-application-api-endpoints-and-api-authentication-using-query-parameters)
* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).
* #### [Deprecation of the CodeQL runner](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codeql-runner)
* The CodeQL runner is deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use CodeQL code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; GitHub Actions users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the CodeQL CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the CodeQL runner. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).
* #### [Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-custom-bit-cache-extensions)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1, support for GitHub's proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 onwards.

  Any repositories that were already present and active on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

  Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

  To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
* #### [Theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#theme-picker-for-github-pages-has-been-removed)
* The theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed from the Pages settings. For more information about configuration of themes for GitHub Pages, see "[Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)."
### [3.4.2: Backups](#3.4.2-backups)

* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).
## Enterprise Server 3.4.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.4.1/download)

### [3.4.1: Security fixes](#3.4.1-security-fixes)

* MEDIUM: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server Management Console that allowed the bypass of CSRF protections. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.5 and was fixed in versions 3.1.19, 3.2.11, 3.3.6, 3.4.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2022-23732.
* MEDIUM: An integer overflow vulnerability was identified in the 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajil` which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. This vulnerability was reported internally and has been assigned CVE-2022-24795.
* Support bundles could include sensitive files if GitHub Actions was enabled.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.4.1: Bug fixes](#3.4.1-bugs)

* A workflow run may not complete if it uses composite-actions.
* When enabling Dependabot, an error caused some security advisories to temporarily read as no-longer applicable.
* Minio processes would have high CPU usage if an old configuration option was present after upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server.
* The options to enable `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1` in the Privacy settings of the Management Console were shown, although removal of those protocol versions occurred in an earlier release.
* In a HA environment, configuring MSSQL replication could require additional manual steps after enabling GitHub Actions for the first time.
* A subset of internal configuration files are more reliably updated after a hotpatch.
* The `ghe-run-migrations` script would sometimes fail to generate temporary certificate names correctly.
* Pre-receive hooks that used `gpg --import` timed out due to insufficient `syscall` privileges.
* In some cluster topologies, webhook delivery information was not available.
* The GitHub Actions deployment graph would display an error when rendering a pending job.
* Elasticsearch health checks would not allow a yellow cluster status when running migrations.
* When using the [Migrations API](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/migrations), queued export jobs were not processed.
* Repositories would display a non-functional Discussions tab in the web UI.
* Organizations created as a result of a user transforming their user account into an organization were not added to the global enterprise account.
* LDAP user sync jobs would fail when trying to sync GPG keys that had been synced previously.
* Links to inaccessible pages were removed.
* Some instances experienced high CPU usage due to large amounts unnecessary background jobs being queued.
* Empty repositories didnt sync correctly to cache servers.
* Adding a team as a reviewer to a pull request would sometimes show the incorrect number of members on that team.
* The remove team membership API endpoint would respond with an error when attempting to remove member externally managed via a SCIM Group.
* A large number of dormant users could cause a GitHub Connect configuration to fail.
* The "Feature & beta enrollments" page in the Site admin web UI was incorrectly available.
* The "Site admin mode" link in the site footer did not change state when clicked.
* Using `ghe-migrator` or exporting from GitHub.com, an export would not include pull request attachments.
### [3.4.1: Changes](#3.4.1-changes)

* Memcached connection limits were increased to better accommodate large cluster topologies.
* The Dependency Graph API previously ran with a statically defined port.
* The default shard counts for cluster-related Elasticsearch shard settings have been updated.
* The [Migrations API](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/migrations) now generates exports of repositories.
* When filtering enterprise members by organization role on the "People" page, the text for the dropdown menu items has been improved.
* The “Triage” and “Maintain” team roles are preserved during repository migrations.
* Performance has been improved for web requests made by enterprise owners.
### [3.4.1: Known issues](#3.4.1-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
* When using SAML encrypted assertions with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]

  To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.

  + Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
  + Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

  To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade). [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
### [3.4.1: Deprecations](#3.4.1-deprecations)

* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-30)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-31)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 will be discontinued on June 3, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-xenserver-hypervisor-support)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3, GitHub Enterprise Server on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.
* #### [Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-content-attachments-api-preview)
* Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.
* #### [Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codes-of-conduct-api-preview)
* The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository's code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the GitHub changelog.
* #### [Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-oauth-application-api-endpoints-and-api-authentication-using-query-parameters)
* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).
* #### [Deprecation of the CodeQL runner](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codeql-runner)
* The CodeQL runner is deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use CodeQL code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; GitHub Actions users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the CodeQL CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the CodeQL runner. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).
* #### [Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-custom-bit-cache-extensions)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1, support for GitHub's proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 onwards.

  Any repositories that were already present and active on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

  Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

  To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
### [3.4.1: Backups](#3.4.1-backups)

* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).

* #### [Secret scanning REST API now returns locations](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#secret-scanning-rest-api-now-returns-locations)
* GitHub Advanced Security customers can now use the REST API to retrieve commit details of secrets detected in private repository scans. The new endpoint returns details of a secret's first detection within a file, including the secret's location and commit SHA. For more information, see "[Secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/secret-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Export license data of committer-based billing for GitHub Advanced Security](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#export-license-data-of-committer-based-billing-for-github-advanced-security)
* Enterprise and organization owners can now export their GitHub Advanced Security license usage data to a CSV file. The Advanced Security billing data can also be retrieved via billing endpoints in the REST API. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-11-export-github-advanced-security-license-usage-data/)."
* #### [GitHub Actions reusable workflows in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#github-actions-reusable-workflows-in-public-beta)
* You can now reuse entire workflows as if they were an action. This feature is available in public beta. Instead of copying and pasting workflow definitions across repositories, you can now reference an existing workflow with a single line of configuration. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-05-github-actions-dry-your-github-actions-configuration-by-reusing-workflows/)."
* #### [Dependabot security and version updates in public beta](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#dependabot-security-and-version-updates-in-public-beta)
* Dependabot is now available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 as a public beta, offering both version updates and security updates for several popular ecosystems. Dependabot on GitHub Enterprise Server requires GitHub Actions and a pool of self-hosted runners configured for Dependabot use. Dependabot on GitHub Enterprise Server also requires GitHub Connect and Dependabot to be enabled by an administrator. Beta feedback and suggestions can be shared in the [Dependabot Feedback GitHub discussion](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/categories/dependabot). For more information and to try the beta, see "[Setting up Dependabot security and version updates on your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/setting-up-dependabot-updates)."
* #### [SAML authentication supports encrypted assertions](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#saml-authentication-supports-encrypted-assertions)
* If you use SAML authentication for GitHub Enterprise Server, you can now configure encrypted assertions from your IdP to improve security. Encrypted assertions add an additional layer of encryption when your IdP transmits information to your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information, see "[Using SAML](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/identity-and-access-management/authenticating-users-for-your-github-enterprise-server-instance/using-saml#enabling-encrypted-assertions)."
* #### [Edit files within pull requests in GitHub Mobile for iOS](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#edit-files-within-pull-requests-in-github-mobile-for-ios)
* In GitHub Mobile for iOS 1.80.0 and later, users can now edit files within a pull request's topic branch. Support for editing files will come to GitHub Mobile for Android in a future release. [Updated: 2022-09-13]
### [3.4.0: Changes](#3.4.0-changes)

* #### [Administration Changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#administration-changes)
* Users can now choose the number of spaces a tab is equal to, by setting their preferred tab size in the "Appearance" settings of their user account. All code with a tab indent will render using the preferred tab size.
* The GitHub Connect data connection record now includes a count of the number of active and dormant users and the configured dormancy period.
* You can now give users access to enterprise-specific links by adding custom footers to GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Configuring custom footers](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-custom-footers)."
* #### [Performance Changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#performance-changes)
* WireGuard, used to secure communication between GitHub Enterprise Server instances in a High Availability configuration, has been migrated to the Kernel implementation.
* #### [Notification Changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#notification-changes)
* Organization owners can now unsubscribe from email notifications when new deploy keys are added to repositories belonging to their organizations. For more information, see "[Configuring notifications](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications)."
* Notification emails from newly created issues and pull requests now include `(Issue #xx)` or `(PR #xx)` in the email subject, so you can recognize and filter emails that reference these types of issues.
* #### [Organization Changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#organization-changes)
* Organizations can now display a `README.md` file on their profile Overview. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-14-readmes-for-organization-profiles/)."
* Members of organizations can now view a list of their enterprise owners under the organization's "People" tab. The enterprise owners list is also now accessible using the GraphQL API. For more information, see the "[`enterpriseOwners`](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/graphql/reference/objects#organization)" field under the Organization object in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Repositories changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#repositories-changes)
* A "Manage Access" section is now shown on the "Collaborators and teams" page in your repository settings. The new section makes it easier for repository administrators to see and manage who has access to their repository, and the level of access granted to each user. Administrators can now:

  + Search all members, teams and collaborators who have access to the repository.
  + View when members have mixed role assignments, granted to them directly as individuals or indirectly via a team. This is visualized through a new "mixed roles" warning, which displays the highest level role the user is granted if their permission level is higher than their assigned role.
  + Manage access to popular repositories reliably, with page pagination and fewer timeouts when large groups of users have access.
* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 includes improvements to the repository invitation experience, such as notifications for private repository invites, a UI prompt when visiting a private repository you have a pending invitation for, and a banner on a public repository overview page when there is an pending invitation.
* You can now use single-character prefixes for custom autolinks. Autolink prefixes also now allow `.`, `-`, `_`, `+`, `=`, `:`, `/`, and `#` characters, as well as alphanumerics. For more information about custom autolinks, see "[Configuring autolinks to reference external resources](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."
* A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in the root of a repository is now highlighted in the "About" sidebar on the repository overview page.
* #### [Releases changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#releases-changes)
* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 includes improvements to the Releases UI, such as automatically generated release notes which display a summary of all the pull requests for a given release. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-20-improvements-to-github-releases-generally-available/)."
* When a release is published, an avatar list is now displayed at the bottom of the release. Avatars for all user accounts mentioned in the release notes are shown. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."
* #### [Markdown changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#markdown-changes)
* You can now use the new "Accessibility" settings page to manage your keyboard shortcuts. You can choose to disable keyboard shortcuts that only use single characters like `S`, `G` `C`, and `.` (the period key). For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-16-managing-keyboard-shortcuts-using-accessibility-settings/)."
* You can now choose to use a fixed-width font in Markdown-enabled fields, like issue comments and pull request descriptions. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-12-fixed-width-font-support-in-markdown-enabled-fields/)."
* You can now paste a URL on selected text to quickly create a Markdown link. This works in all Markdown-enabled fields, such as issue comments and pull request descriptions. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-linkify-selected-text-on-url-paste/)."
* An image URL can now be appended with a theme context, such as `#gh-dark-mode-only`, to define how the Markdown image is displayed to a viewer. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-24-specify-theme-context-for-images-in-markdown/)."
* When creating or editing a gist file with the Markdown (`.md`) file extension, you can now use the "Preview" or "Preview Changes" tab to display a Markdown rendering of the file contents. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-17-preview-the-markdown-rendering-of-gists/)."
* When typing the name of a GitHub user in issues, pull requests and discussions, the @mention suggester now ranks existing participants higher than other GitHub users, so that it's more likely the user you're looking for will be listed.
* Right-to-left languages are now supported natively in Markdown files, issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments.
* #### [Issues and pull requests changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#issues-and-pull-requests-changes)
* The diff setting to hide whitespace changes in the pull request "Files changed" tab is now retained for your user account for that pull request. The setting you have chosen is automatically reapplied if you navigate away from the page and then revisit the "Files changed" tab of the same pull request.
* When using auto assignment for pull request code reviews, you can now choose to only notify requested team members independently of your auto assignment settings. This setting is useful in scenarios where many users are auto assigned but not all users require notification. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-team-member-pull-request-review-notifications-can-be-configured-independently-of-auto-assignment/)."
* #### [Branches changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#branches-changes)
* Organization and repository administrators can now trigger webhooks to listen for changes to branch protection rules on their repositories. For more information, see the "[branch\_protection\_rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#branch_protection_rule)" event in the webhooks events and payloads documentation.
* When configuring protected branches, you can now enforce that a required status check is provided by a specific GitHub App. If a status is then provided by a different application, or by a user via a commit status, merging is prevented. This ensures all changes are validated by the intended application. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-01-ensure-required-status-checks-provided-by-the-intended-app/)."
* Only users with administrator permissions are now able to rename protected branches and modify branch protection rules. Previously, with the exception of the default branch, a collaborator could rename a branch and consequently any non-wildcard branch protection rules that applied to that branch were also renamed. For more information, see "[Renaming a branch](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
* Administrators can now allow only specific users and teams to bypass pull request requirements. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-19-allow-bypassing-required-pull-requests/)."
* Administrators can now allow only specific users and teams to force push to a repository. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-21-specify-who-can-force-push-to-a-repository/)."
* When requiring pull requests for all changes to a protected branch, administrators can now choose if approved reviews are also a requirement. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-require-pull-requests-without-requiring-reviews/)."
* #### [GitHub Actions changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#github-actions-changes)
* GitHub Actions workflows triggered by Dependabot for the `create`, `deployment`, and `deployment_status` events now always receive a read-only token and no secrets. Similarly, workflows triggered by Dependabot for the `pull_request_target` event on pull requests where the base ref was created by Dependabot, now always receive a read-only token and no secrets. These changes are designed to prevent potentially malicious code from executing in a privileged workflow. For more information, see "[Automating Dependabot with GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions)."
* Workflow runs on `push` and `pull_request` events triggered by Dependabot will now respect the permissions specified in your workflows, allowing you to control how you manage automatic dependency updates. The default token permissions will remain read-only. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-respect-permissions-key-in-workflows/)."
* GitHub Actions workflows triggered by Dependabot will now be sent the Dependabot secrets. You can now pull from private package registries in your CI using the same secrets you have configured for Dependabot to use, improving how GitHub Actions and Dependabot work together. For more information, see "[Automating Dependabot with GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions)."
* You can now manage runner groups and see the status of your self-hosted runners using new Runners and Runner Groups pages in the UI. The Actions settings page for your repository or organization now shows a summary view of your runners, and allows you to deep dive into a specific runner to edit it or see what job it may be currently running. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-20-github-actions-experience-refresh-for-the-management-of-self-hosted-runners/)."
* Actions authors can now have their action run in Node.js 16 by specifying [`runs.using` as `node16` in the action's `action.yml`](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions). This is in addition to the existing Node.js 12 support; actions can continue to specify `runs.using: node12` to use the Node.js 12 runtime.
* For manually triggered workflows, GitHub Actions now supports the `choice`, `boolean`, and `environment` input types in addition to the default `string` type. For more information, see "[`on.workflow_dispatch.inputs`](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_dispatchinputs)."
* Actions written in YAML, also known as composite actions, now support `if` conditionals. This lets you prevent specific steps from executing unless a condition has been met. Like steps defined in workflows, you can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional.
* The search order behavior for self-hosted runners has now changed, so that the first available matching runner at any level will run the job in all cases. This allows jobs to be sent to self-hosted runners much faster, especially for organizations and enterprises with lots of self-hosted runners. Previously, when running a job that required a self-hosted runner, GitHub Actions would look for self-hosted runners in the repository, organization, and enterprise, in that order.
* Runner labels for GitHub Actions self-hosted runners can now be listed, added and removed using the REST API. For more information about using the new APIs at a repository, organization, or enterprise level, see "[Repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/actions#list-labels-for-a-self-hosted-runner-for-a-repository)", "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/actions#add-custom-labels-to-a-self-hosted-runner-for-an-organization)", and "[Enterprises](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#list-labels-for-a-self-hosted-runner-for-an-enterprise)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Dependabot and Dependency graph changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#dependabot-and-dependency-graph-changes)
* Dependency graph now supports detecting Python dependencies in repositories that use the Poetry package manager. Dependencies will be detected from both `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` manifest files.
* When configuring Dependabot security and version updates on GitHub Enterprise Server, we recommend you also enable Dependabot in GitHub Connect. This will allow Dependabot to retrieve an updated list of dependencies and vulnerabilities from GitHub.com, by querying for information such as the changelogs of the public releases of open source code that you depend upon. For more information, see "[Enabling the dependency graph and Dependabot alerts for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-the-dependency-graph-and-dependabot-alerts-for-your-enterprise)."
* Dependabot alerts alerts can now be dismissed using the GraphQL API. For more information, see the "[dismissRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/graphql/reference/mutations#dismissrepositoryvulnerabilityalert)" mutation in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Code scanning and secret scanning changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#code-scanning-and-secret-scanning-changes)
* The CodeQL CLI now supports including markdown-rendered query help in SARIF files, so that the help text can be viewed in the code scanning UI when the query generates an alert. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-23-display-help-text-for-your-custom-codeql-queries-in-code-scanning/)."
* The CodeQL CLI and Visual Studio Code extension now support building databases and analyzing code on machines powered by Apple Silicon, such as Apple M1. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-codeql-now-supports-apple-silicon-m1/)."
* The depth of CodeQL's analysis has been improved by adding support for more [libraries and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) from the Python ecosystem. As a result, CodeQL can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, steps through which that data flows, and potentially dangerous sinks where the data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of code scanning alerts. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-24-codeql-code-scanning-now-recognizes-more-python-libraries-and-frameworks/)."
* Code scanning with CodeQL now includes beta support for analyzing code in all common Ruby versions, up to and including 3.02. For more information, see the "[GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-codeql-code-scanning-adds-beta-support-for-ruby/)."
* Several improvements have been made to the code scanning API:

  + The `fixed_at` timestamp has been added to alerts. This timestamp is the first time that the alert was not detected in an analysis.
  + Alert results can now be sorted using `sort` and `direction` on either `created`, `updated` or `number`. For more information, see "[List code scanning alerts for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)."
  + A `Last-Modified` header has been added to the alerts and alert endpoint response. For more information, see [`Last-Modified`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified) in the Mozilla documentation.
  + The `relatedLocations` field has been added to the SARIF response when you request a code scanning analysis. The field may contain locations which are not the primary location of the alert. See an example in the [SARIF spec](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html#_Toc16012616) and for more information see "[Get a code scanning analysis for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/code-scanning#get-a-code-scanning-analysis-for-a-repository)."
  + Both `help` and `tags` data have been added to the webhook response alert rule object. For more information, see "[Code scanning alert webhooks events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#code_scanning_alert)."
  + Personal access tokens with the `public_repo` scope now have write access for code scanning endpoints on public repos, if the user has permission.

  For more information, see "[Code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/code-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* GitHub Advanced Security customers can now use the REST API to retrieve private repository secret scanning results at the enterprise level. The new endpoint supplements the existing repository-level and organization-level endpoints. For more information, see "[Secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/secret-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Mobile changes](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#mobile-changes)
* Support for GitHub Mobile is now enabled by default for new GitHub Enterprise Server instances. If you have not explicitly disabled or enabled GitHub Mobile, GitHub Mobile will be enabled when you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.0 or later. If you previously disabled or enabled GitHub Mobile for your instance, your preference will be preserved upon upgrade. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Mobile for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/managing-github-mobile-for-your-enterprise)."
### [3.4.0: Known issues](#3.4.0-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services needs to be restarted after restoring appliance from backup taken on a different host.
* After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
* When using SAML encrypted assertions with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]

  To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.

  + Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
  + Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 or later may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 when you upgrade from an earlier release to 3.5 or later. A fix is available in the [3.5.5](/en/enterprise-server%403.5/admin/release-notes#3.5.5) and [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch releases.

  To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade). [Updated: 2022-09-01]

### [3.4.0: Deprecations](#3.4.0-deprecations)

* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-30)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-github-enterprise-server-31)
* **GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 will be discontinued on June 3, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.
* #### [Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-xenserver-hypervisor-support)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3, GitHub Enterprise Server on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.
* #### [Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-content-attachments-api-preview)
* Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.
* #### [Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codes-of-conduct-api-preview)
* The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository's code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the GitHub changelog.
* #### [Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-oauth-application-api-endpoints-and-api-authentication-using-query-parameters)
* Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).
* #### [Deprecation of the CodeQL runner](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-the-codeql-runner)
* The CodeQL runner is deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use CodeQL code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; GitHub Actions users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the CodeQL CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the CodeQL runner. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).
* #### [Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#deprecation-of-custom-bit-cache-extensions)
* Starting in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1, support for GitHub's proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 onwards.

  Any repositories that were already present and active on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

  Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

  To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
* #### [Change to the format of authentication tokens affects GitHub Connect](/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/release-notes#change-to-the-format-of-authentication-tokens-affects-github-connect)
* GitHub Connect will no longer work after June 3rd for instances running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 or older, due to the format of GitHub authentication tokens changing. For more information, see the [GitHub changelog](https://github.blog/2022-05-20-action-needed-by-github-connect-customers-using-ghes-3-1-and-older-to-adopt-new-authentication-token-format-updates/). [Updated: 2022-06-14]
### [3.4.0: Backups](#3.4.0-backups)

* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).
### [3.4.0: Errata](#3.4.0-errata)

* "[Encrypted secrets](/en/enterprise-server%403.4/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]

# GitHub Bug Bounty

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.

If you have found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://hackerone.com/github).

You can find useful information in our [rules](#rules), [scope](#scope), [targets](#targets) and [FAQ](#faqs) sections.

Happy hacking!

## Rewards

All bounty submissions are rated by GitHub using a purposefully simple scale. Each vulnerability is unique, but the following is a rough guideline we use internally for rating and rewarding submissions:

---

**$30** - **$1,500**
Bonus

For the month of October we’ll be offering an 20% bonus on the highest valid submission for any hackers new to our program, a 10% bonus on the highest valid submission for returning hackers as well as a 5% bonus on reports that include a Nuclei template that we can use to verify fixes! Note: Each hacker can earn atleast one of these bonuses!

Find more details regarding eligibility in our [FAQ](#faqs).

---

**$20,000** - **$30,000+**
Critical

Critical severity issues present a direct and immediate risk to a broad array of our users or to a GitHub product itself. They often affect relatively low-level/foundational components in one of our application stacks or infrastructure. For example:

* arbitrary code/command execution on a server in our production network
* arbitrary SQL queries on a production database
* bypassing the login process, either password or 2FA
* access to sensitive production user data or access to internal production systems
* accessing another user’s data in the GitHub Actions service

The upper bound for critical vulnerabilities, $30,000, is only a guideline, and GitHub may reward higher amounts for exceptional reports.

---

**$10,000** - **$20,000**
High

High severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify highly sensitive data that they are not authorized to access. They are generally more narrow in scope than critical issues, though they may still grant an attacker extensive access. For example:

* injecting attacker controlled content into GitHub.com (XSS) that bypasses CSP
* bypassing authorization logic to grant a repository or package collaborator more access than intended
* discovering sensitive user or GitHub data in a publicly exposed resource, such as an S3 bucket
* overwriting a customer repository or package that should be inaccessible
* gaining access to a non-critical resource that only employees should be able to reach
* using the GitHub Actions repo-scoped GitHub token to access high-risk private content outside of that repository
* sending authentication credentials from a client app to an unintended server
* code execution in a client app that requires no user interaction, such as arbitrary code execution upon repo clone or via a protocol handler

---

**$4,000** - **$10,000**
Medium

Medium severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify limited amounts of data that they are not authorized to access. They generally grant access to less sensitive information than high severity issues. For example:

* disclosing the title of issues in private repositories, which should be be inaccessible
* injecting attacker controlled content into GitHub.com (XSS) but not bypassing CSP or executing sensitive actions with another user’s session
* bypassing CSRF validation for low risk actions, such as starring a repository or unsubscribing from a mailing list
* code execution in a client app that requires minimal, expected user interaction, such as performing actions on a repository or [with a package](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/config#ignore-scripts) that a user would not expect to lead to code execution
* package integrity compromise, i.e., downloading a package that does not match the integrity as defined in `package-lock.json`

---

**$617** - **$2,000**
Low

Low severity issues allow an attacker to access extremely limited amounts of data. They may violate an expectation for how something is intended to work but allow nearly no escalation of privilege or ability to trigger unintended behavior by an attacker. For example:

* signing up arbitrary users for access to an “early access feature” without their consent
* creating an issue comment that bypasses our image proxying filter by providing a malformed URL
* triggering verbose or debug error pages without proof of exploitability or obtaining sensitive information
* triggering application exceptions that could affect many users
* injecting JavaScript event handlers into links, etc., that are mitigated by CSP on GitHub.com
* disclosing the existence of private packages on npm that should be inaccessible, e.g., through error messages (but not through timing attacks, which are ineligible)
* novel supply chain vulnerabilities that affect a GitHub product but are not solely limited to that product
* credentials such as those from the `.npmrc` file or from GitHub Enterprise Server being leaked in logs

## Rules

Before you start

* Check the [list of domains](#scope) that are in scope for the Bug Bounty program and the [list of targets](#targets) for useful information for getting started.
* Check the list of bugs that have been [classified as ineligible](/ineligible.html). Submissions which are ineligible will likely be closed as `Not Applicable`.
* Check the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) for recently launched features.
* Never attempt non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.
* When in doubt, contact us at `bounty@github.com`.
* By participating in GitHub’s Bug Bounty program (the “Program”), you acknowledge that you have read and agree to GitHub’s [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) as well as the following:

  + you are not currently a GitHub employee or contractor, were not a GitHub employee or contractor within six months prior to submission, and you did not collaborate on your submission with anyone who was.
  + your participation in the Program will not violate any law applicable to you, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.
  + you are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, withholding or otherwise, arising from or relating to your participation in the Program, including from any bounty payments.
  + GitHub reserves the right to terminate or discontinue the Program at its discretion.
  + Only test for vulnerabilities on sites you know to be operated by GitHub and are [in-scope](#scope). Some sites hosted on subdomains of `GitHub.com` are operated by third parties and should not be tested.
  + We cannot reward any individual on any U.S. sanctions list, or any individual residing in any U.S.-sanctioned country or region. For more information, please see https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines.

Legal safe harbor

Your research is covered by the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program Legal Safe Harbor](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/github-bug-bounty-program-legal-safe-harbor) policy. In summary:

* We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy as “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this bug bounty program’s scope.
* We want you to coordinate disclosure through our bug bounty program, and don’t want researchers put in fear of legal consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action you think might go outside the bounds of our policy.
* Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties. We may provide non-identifying substantive information from your report to an affected third party, but only after notifying you and receiving a commitment that the third party will not pursue legal action against you. We will only share identifying information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) with a third party if you give your written permission.
* If your security research as part of the bug bounty program violates certain restrictions in our site policies, the safe harbor terms permit a limited exemption.
* If you cannot accept a bounty reward for any reason, please ensure that you inform us when you submit your report, as there is no way to rescind the payment once awarded.

Performing your research

* Do not impact other users with your testing, this includes testing vulnerabilities in repositories or organizations you do not own. If you are attempting to find an authorization bypass, you must use accounts you own.
* We recommend adding your HackerOne `@wearehackerone.com` email address to any GitHub account that you use to perform security research and testing. If you use multiple GitHub accounts for testing, [you can use aliases of your HackerOne email address](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-email-alias.html#multiple-aliases). Clearly identifying accounts that are associated with bounty research helps our teams to differentiate between possibly malicious activity and that of researchers involved in our Bug Bounty program. Please note that adding your HackerOne email address does not provide any exemptions to our Terms of Service or permit you to act beyond our bounty rules and scope.
* The following are **never** allowed and are ineligible for reward. We may suspend your GitHub account and ban your IP address for:

  + Performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) or other volumetric attacks
  + Spamming content
  + Large-scale vulnerability scanners, scrapers, or automated tools which produce excessive amounts of traffic.
    - Note: We *do* allow the use of automated tools so long as they do not produce excessive amounts of traffic. For example, running one `nmap` scan against one host is allowed, but sending 65,000 requests in two minutes using Burp Suite Intruder is excessive.
* Researching denial-of-service attacks is allowed and eligible for rewards only if you follow these rules:

  + There are no limits for researching denial of service vulnerabilities against your own instance of [GitHub Enterprise Server](/targets/github-enterprise-server.html). We strongly recommend/prefer this method for researching denial of service issues.
  + If you choose to test on GitHub proper (i.e. `https://github.com`)
    - Research **must** be performed in organizations or repositories you own
    - Stop **immediately** if you believe you have affected the availability of our services. Don’t worry about demonstrating the full impact of your vulnerability, GitHub’s security team will be able to determine the impact.

Handling personally identifiable information (PII)

* Personally identifying information (PII) includes:
  + legal and/or full names
  + names or usernames combined with other identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses
  + health or financial information (including insurance information, social security numbers, etc.)
  + information about political or religious affiliations
  + information about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or other identifying information that could be used for discriminatory purposes
* Do not intentionally access others’ PII. If you suspect a service provides access to PII, limit queries to your own personal information.
* Report the vulnerability *immediately* and do not attempt to access any other data. The GitHub Security team will assess the scope and impact of the PII exposure.
* Limit the amount of data returned from services. For SQL injection, for example, limit the number of rows returned
* You must delete all your local, stored, or cached copies of data containing PII as soon as possible. We may ask you to sign a certificate of deletion and confidentiality agreement regarding the exact information you accessed. This agreement will not affect your bounty reward.
* We may ask you for the usernames and IP addresses used during your testing to assess the impact of the vulnerability

Reporting your vulnerability

* Submissions must include written instructions for reproducing the vulnerability. Submissions without clear reproduction steps or which only include reproduction steps in video form may be ineligible for a reward.
* When reporting vulnerabilities you must keep all information on HackerOne. Do not post information to video-sharing or pastebin sites. Videos and images can be uploaded directly via HackerOne.
* For vulnerabilities involving personally identifiable information, please explain the kind of PII you believe is exposed and limit the amount of PII data included in your submissions. For textual information and screenshots, please only include redacted data in your submission.
* During the course of an investigation, it may take time to resolve the issue you have reported. We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing details regarding an issue you’ve reported until the fix has been publicly made available.

Receiving your award

* All reward amounts are determined by our [severity guidelines](/#rewards).
* In addition to the bounty reward, some reports will also receive a coupon code that can be redeemed for swag items at [the GitHub Bug Bounty Merch Shop](https://bugbounty.printengine.com/). For more information about the store, [please visit the shop’s FAQ page](https://bugbounty.printengine.com/faqs).
* When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
* You are free to publish write-ups about your vulnerability, and GitHub will not limit what you write. We may pay out your reward before the vulnerability is patched, so we may ask that you delay publishing to keep other GitHub users safe.
* GitHub is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for GitHub Enterprise Server. Eligible Bug Bounty submissions that affect GitHub Enterprise Server may be assigned CVEs. These CVEs will be shared with submitters via HackerOne and listed in the GitHub Enterprise Server [release notes](https://enterprise.github.com/releases).
* If you would prefer to donate your bounty reward to an established 501(c)(3) charitable organization, GitHub will match your donation. If the bounty has already been processed into your account, it can no longer be donated through HackerOne and is no longer eligible for matching donations. To reduce the likelihood of a bounty being processed before it can be donated, we recommend [changing your payment preferences to monthly in your account settings](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/payout-methods.html). To donate your reward and have it matched, submit a support ticket to HackerOne with the following information:

  + the report ID for which you want to donate the bounty;
  + the name and website of the charity you want to donate to;
  + that you would like the donation matched using GitHub’s process; and
  + whether you want to be named as the donor or would prefer to remain anonymous. Keep in mind that we can only attribute the donation to you if the charity allows us to give a name.

## FAQs

How is the bounty reward determined?

Our security and development teams take many factors into account when determining a reward. These factors include the complexity of successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the potential exposure, as well as the percentage of impacted users and systems. Sometimes an otherwise critical vulnerability has a very low impact simply because it is mitigated by some other component, e.g., it requires user interaction, it relies on an obscure web browser, or it would need to be combined with another vulnerability that does not currently exist. Our teams use [our documented severity guidelines](/#rewards) to determine the bounty reward amounts rather than correlating with CVSS ratings. Additionally, at least two GitHub security engineers agree on the severity and amount before a payout is made.

Can I submit a video proof-of-concept?

You can certainly attach a video if you believe it will clarify your submission. However, all submissions must also include step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug. The security team will let you know if we think a video will clarify your report. Submissions which only include video reproduction steps will have a longer response time and we may close your submission as `Not Applicable`.

Did my submission just get rejected by a bot?

You may get a response that appears to be from a bot. The bot does some work for us, but only when we tell it to. We “do our own stunts” at GitHub Security. An application security engineer at GitHub triages each submission. In most cases, we use the bot to automate messaging and other tasks for us. Rest assured, a human did look at your submission.

Can I submit my report via a third-party or vulnerability broker?

GitHub’s Bug Bounty program is designed to both reward individual researchers and increase the security of all GitHub users. We don’t believe that disclosing GitHub vulnerabilities to third parties achieves either of those goals. As a result, any vulnerabilities that are disclosed to third-party before being submitted to our program are ineligible for rewards.

Why does severity on HackerOne not match the reward I was given?

We do not always update HackerOne with the assessed severity because we track that information internally. Our payout guidelines and the value of the reward dictate our assessment of severity, not the severity on HackerOne.

Where is your PGP key? I want to use it when I submit a vulnerability.

If you absolutely believe encrypting the message is necessary, please read our [instructions and caveats for PGP submissions](/pgp.html).

What kinds of DoS submissions are valid?

As noted in the `performing your research` section, denial of service research is best done on your own instance of GHES. Causing an availability issue is simply not helpful. We are only interested in denial of service issues at the application layer (logic bombs, ReDoS, etc.). Volumetric attack submissions are not eligible for rewards and we may suspend your GitHub account or temporarily ban your IP address.

How can I earn an invitation to the GitHub VIP program?

We’re stoked to hear you’d like to become a Hacktocat! In order to be eligible to receive an invitation, you must earn at least $20,000 in our program and have submitted at least 2 reports over the last 2 years. Please note that meeting this criteria does not guarantee an invitation. We reserve the right to extend invitations at our discretion. We review eligibility and make decisions on candidates on a quarterly basis.

What are the benefits of joining the VIP program?

Our VIP Hacktocats gain access to a Slack channel with Hubbers, exclusive Hacktocat swag, access to beta features, and more!

How can I make sure I'm eligible for the Hacktober 2024 bonuses?

We’re offering an 20% bonus to any first time submitter to our program on their highest severity for a valid submission to our program. In order to be eligible, you must have not sent in a valid submission to our program in the past.

We’re also offering a 10% bonus to any returning submitters on their highest severity for a valid submission to our program. Note: Each hacker can only earn one of the two bonuses mentioned above.

In order to be eligible for the 5% bonus for submission of a Nuclei template, your submitted template must:

* Allow GitHub to directly reproduce the reported issue
* Allow GitHub to get a true positive confirmation that the reported vulnerability is fixed

These bonuses are available at GitHub’s sole discretion, and additional circumstances around the complexity of reports may be considered when evaluating the requirements detailed above.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.20

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.20](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.20/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.20: Security fixes](#3.6.20-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.20: Bug fixes](#3.6.20-bugs)

* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
### [3.6.20: Changes](#3.6.20-changes)

* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.6.20: Known issues](#3.6.20-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
## Enterprise Server 3.6.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.19/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.19: Security fixes](#3.6.19-security-fixes)

* To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.19: Bug fixes](#3.6.19-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.6.19: Changes](#3.6.19-changes)

* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
### [3.6.19: Known issues](#3.6.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.18/download)

August 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.18: Security fixes](#3.6.18-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.6.18: Bug fixes](#3.6.18-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* When an administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, repository creation could fail if an organization owner did not set a primary email address.
### [3.6.18: Changes](#3.6.18-changes)

* Administrators with SSH access to an instance can view the version of GitHub Enterprise Server on the instance by using the `-v` flag with the `ghe-version` utility.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.6.18: Known issues](#3.6.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.17/download)

August 10, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.17: Security fixes](#3.6.17-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.17: Bug fixes](#3.6.17-bugs)

* On an instance in a high availability configuration, on some platforms, replication could perform poorly over links with very high latency.
* On an instance with custom firewall rules defined, a configuration run with `ghe-config-apply` could take longer than expected.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.6.17: Changes](#3.6.17-changes)

* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console.
* The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
### [3.6.17: Known issues](#3.6.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.16/download)

July 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.16: Security fixes](#3.6.16-security-fixes)

* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.6.16: Bug fixes](#3.6.16-bugs)

* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
### [3.6.16: Changes](#3.6.16-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* On an instance with 170 or fewer vCPUs, the default for `app.babeld.threads-max` is 512 instead of 3 times the number of vCPUs. The monitor dashboard also includes metrics within the "Babeld threads" section.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
### [3.6.16: Known issues](#3.6.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled.

* If a user's request to the instance's API included authentication credentials within a URL parameter, administrators could see the credentials in JSON within the instance's audit log.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.15: Bug fixes](#3.6.15-bugs)

* If an administrator updated the instance's TLS certificate using the Management Console API's [Set settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console) endpoint, sending the certificate and key data as a URL query parameter resulted in the data appearing unmasked in system logs.
* If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 could take longer than expected.
* After an enterprise owner set a permanent rate limit for a users GitHub App at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/installations`, the instance did not respect the rate limit.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
### [3.6.15: Changes](#3.6.15-changes)

### [3.6.14: Security fixes](#3.6.14-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.14: Bug fixes](#3.6.14-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes.
* In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output.
* If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error.
* If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 could take longer than expected.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
### [3.6.14: Changes](#3.6.14-changes)

### [3.6.13: Security fixes](#3.6.13-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog.
### [3.6.13: Bug fixes](#3.6.13-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.6.13: Changes](#3.6.13-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.11

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.11](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.11/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.11: Security fixes](#3.6.11-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.6.11: Bug fixes](#3.6.11-bugs)

* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users may have seen a discrepancy between the number of alerts displayed on a repositorys "Security" tab and in the sidebar for the "Security" tab.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section.
* After upgrading an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7, creating a repository or viewing the security settings page for an organization or repository could result in a `500` error due to a GitHub Advanced Security backfill job not completing before the upgrade started.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table.
* On an instance with GitHub Packages enabled, after users pushed to the Container registry, the instance erroneously responded with a `429 Too Many Requests` error in cases when the instance could accommodate the request. The limits have been raised, and users should receive this message less often. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
### [3.6.11: Changes](#3.6.11-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.11: Known issues](#3.6.11-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* On an instance configured for SAML authentication, when signing in, users may erroneously see an error indicating "User has already been taken." [Updated: 2023-07-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]

### [3.6.8: Security fixes](#3.6.8-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.8: Bug fixes](#3.6.8-bugs)

* After a site administrator adjusted the cutoff date for allowing SSH connections with RSA keys using `ghe-config app.gitauth.rsa-sha1`, the instance would still disallow connections with RSA keys if the connection attempt was signed by the SHA-1 hash function.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* When enabling automatic TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt, the process could fail with the error `The certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or the certificate chain in missing intermediate CA signing certificates`.
* In some cases, users were unable to convert existing issues to discussions. If an issue is stuck while being converted to a discussion, enterprise owners can review the "Known issues" section below for more information.
### [3.6.8: Changes](#3.6.8-changes)

* When a timeout occurs during diff generation, such as when a commit displays an error that the diff is taking too long to generate, the `push` webhook event will deliver empty diff information. Previously, the `push` webhook event would fail to be delivered.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.6/download)

January 12, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.6: Security fixes](#3.6.6-security-fixes)

* Sanitize additional secrets in support bundles and the configuration log.
* Dependencies for the CodeQL action have been updated to the latest security versions.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.6: Bug fixes](#3.6.6-bugs)

* The metrics `Active workers` and `Queued requests` for `github` (renamed from metadata), `gitauth`, and `unicorn` container services werent correctly read from collectd and displayed in the Management Console.
* Dependabot Alert emails would be sent to disabled repositories.
* Data migrations could fail when the underlying database table contained only a single record.
* When viewing a pull requests diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* The `git-janitor`command was unable to fix outdated `multi-pack-index.lock` files, resulting in the repository failing maintenance.
* The `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts were incorrectly set as `false` when branch protections did exist.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
* When updating custom patterns, the pattern state was immediately set to published.
### [3.6.6: Changes](#3.6.6-changes)

* Improved the reliability of the real time updates service (Alive) to make it more resilient against network issues with Redis.
* The `ghe-support-bundle` and `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` commands were updated to include the `-p/--period` flag to generate a time constrained support bundle. The duration can be specified in days and hours, for example: `-p '2 hours'`, `-p '1 day'`, `-p '2 days 5 hours'`.
* When upgrading an instance with a new root partition, running the `ghe-upgrade` command with the `-t/--target` option ensures the preflight check for the minimum disk storage size is executed against the target partition.
* The performance of configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` has been improved.
* When exporting account data, backing up a repository, or performing a migration, the link to a repository archive now expires after 1 hour. Previously the archive link expired after 5 minutes.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.6: Known issues](#3.6.6-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."

## Enterprise Server 3.6.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.5/download)

December 13, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.5: Security fixes](#3.6.5-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
* **HIGH**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin access for a repository. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.0. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23741).
* **MEDIUM**: An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed private repositories to be added to a GitHub Actions runner group via the API by a user who did not have access to those repositories, resulting in the repository names being shown in the UI. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the GHES instance, permissions to modify GitHub Actions runner groups, and successfully guess the obfuscated ID of private repositories. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46257).
### [3.6.5: Bug fixes](#3.6.5-bugs)

* A race condition blocked upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later until a site administrator retried the upgrade.
* Site administrators were not able to manage security products settings for repositories they had unlocked.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-status` command on a cache replica via the administrative shell (SSH), the command incorrectly reported overall Git and Alambic cluster replication status information as if it pertained only to cache replication.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* When using repository caching with an instance in a high availability configuration, if a Git client used SSH instead of HTTPS for a repositorys remote URL, Git LFS would fetch objects from the instances primary node instead of the appropriate cache replica node.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* If a user uploaded more than one file while creating a new Gist, the user could not delete any files uploaded after the first.
* In some cases, searches via the API returned a `500` error.
* In some cases, when browsing repositories in the web interface, an erroneous banner indicated that a repository didn't contain a specific undefined path on the current branch.
* The `member` webhook event did not include the `from` and `to` field values for the `permission` field as part of the `changes` field.
* Adding a collaborator to a user-owned fork of a private, organization-owned repository with triage, maintain, or custom access resulted in a `500` error.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* A debug-level message appeared in a system log, which could consume space rapidly on the instance's root storage volume.
### [3.6.5: Changes](#3.6.5-changes)

* To avoid failing domain verification due to the 63-character limit enforced by DNS providers for DNS records, the GitHub-generated `TXT` record to verify domain ownership is now limited to 63 characters.
* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot alerts, GitHub Enterprise Server enqueues the synchronization of advisory data to ensure hourly updates from GitHub.com.
* A user's list of recently accessed repositories no longer includes deleted repositories.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later.

### [3.6.4: Security fixes](#3.6.4-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Scoped user-to-server tokens from GitHub Apps could bypass authorization checks in GraphQL API requests when accessing non-repository resources. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23739).
* **MEDIUM**: Pull request preview links did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing a malicious user to embed dangerous links in the instances web UI. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a repository-scoped token with read/write access to modify GitHub Actions workflow files without a workflow scope. The "[Repository contents](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/repos/contents#create-or-update-file-contents)" should enforce workflow scope. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46258](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46258).
### [3.6.4: Bug fixes](#3.6.4-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* Setting the maintenance mode with an IP Exception List would not persist across upgrades.
* GitHub Pages builds could time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability.
* Status details for the replication of Git LFS objects to repository cache replica nodes were not visible in the `ghe-repl-status` output on those nodes.
* After configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would send digest emails to suspended users.
* The audit log timestamp for Dependabot alert events returned the creation date of the alert instead of the timestamp when a user took action on the alert.
* When using the CodeQL action, the runs annotations would include a spurious `HttpError: Upload not found` error.
* When accessing an instances JavaScript resources from behind a proxy, the browser displayed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.
* If a user named a status check with leading or trailing spaces, the instance created a duplicate check if another check existed with the same name and no leading or trailing spaces.
* If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook.
* In some cases, an instance could replace an active repository with a deleted repository.
* Git LFS objects in a repository with a cache replication policy would not be copied to cache replicas if the total number of objects in the repository exceeded 5,000.
* After running migrations for the GitHub Enterprise Importer on an instance configured for high availability, replication of migration storage assets would not catch up.
* Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container.
### [3.6.4: Changes](#3.6.4-changes)

* If a site administrator has not yet configured GitHub Actions for the instance, the UI for setting up code scanning will prompt the user to configure GitHub Actions.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later.

* **HIGH**: Added checks to address an improper cache key vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to access private repository files through a public repository. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-23738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23738).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated Redis to 5.0.14 to address [CVE-2021-32672](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32672) and [CVE-2021-32762](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32762).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated GitHub Actions runners to fix a bug that allowed environment variables in GitHub Actions jobs to escape the context of the variable and modify the invocation of `docker` commands directly. For more information, see the [Actions Runner security advisory](https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3).
* **MEDIUM**: An improper privilege management vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed users with improper privileges to create or delete pages via the API. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be added to an organization's repo with write permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23737](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23737).

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.3: Bug fixes](#3.6.3-bugs)

* After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
* After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
* When a user accessed a renamed repository using Git, the hostname in the Git output incorrectly indicated GitHub.com instead of the instance's hostname.
* On instances using LDAP authentication and LDAP sync, sync would fail and print `undefined method ord for nil:NilClass` in `ldap-sync.log`.
* When a user visited links to view history or suggest an improvement to the GitHub Advisory Database, the URLs were incorrect, resulting in a `404` error.
* Deleted assets and assets scheduled to be purged within a repository, such as LFS files, took too long to to be cleaned up.
* On instances configured for high availability, `ghe-repl-status` incorrectly reported that replication was behind for repositories that users had previously deleted.
* If a user installed a GitHub App for the user account and then converted the account into an organization, the app was not granted organization permissions.
* Missing secret scanning alerts on instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was not upgraded directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 are now visible in the web interface and through the REST API.
* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some tokens detected by secret scanning were reported as "unknown tokens."
### [3.6.3: Changes](#3.6.3-changes)

* To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements. The check also verifies Elasticsearch's health. You can review the current requirements for CPU, memory, and storage for GitHub Enterprise Server in the "Minimum requirements" section within each article in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.3: Known issues](#3.6.3-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.2/download)

September 21, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.2: Features](#3.6.2-features)

* Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field.
### [3.6.2: Security fixes](#3.6.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
* **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.2: Bug fixes](#3.6.2-bugs)

* In some cases, collectd could log excessive metrics-related errors in `/var/log/collectd.log`.
* When configuring the external domain name of a repository cache replica node using `ghe-repl-node --cache-domain`, the command would return an error that prevented Git LFS caching from being enabled.
* Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
* Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
* The option to enable TLS encryption for incoming SMTP connections to an instance was missing from the Management Console.
* In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
* Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
* The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation.
* When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
* A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
* In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
* After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
* After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
* Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
* When viewing a pull request's diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
* Repositories for packages erroneously displayed a "Used by" section.
### [3.6.2: Changes](#3.6.2-changes)

* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.2: Known issues](#3.6.2-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* After upgrading a replica node to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0 or later and restarting replication, in some situations Git replication may stop progressing and continue to show `WARNING: git replication is behind the primary …`. If you encounter this known issue contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-03]
* Hotpatch upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.2 may fail. Upgrades with the full `.pkg` are unaffected. If the upgrade fails for your instance, workaround this issue by connecting to the administrative shell (ssh) and running the following non-interactive command:

  ```
  echo "grub-pc grub-pc/install_devices_empty boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections

  ```

  If you're unable to upgrade, or if you need further assistance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-14]

## Enterprise Server 3.6.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.1/download)

August 30, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.1: Bug fixes](#3.6.1-bugs)

* After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository.
* Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* The site admin page for individual users at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/admin` contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster.
* In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error.
* After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear.
* In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
* The site admin bar at the top of the web interface contained a broken link to the SHA for the currently running version of the application.
* Organization owners were unable to set the level of access required to create discussions.
* Discussions users were incorrectly directed to the community guidelines for GitHub.com.
* In some cases, users were incorrectly instructed to verify their email before creating a discussion.
* Alerts from secret scanning for GitHub Advanced Security customers were missing in the web UI and REST API if a site administrator did not upgrade directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The alerts are now visible.
### [3.6.1: Changes](#3.6.1-changes)

* Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
* APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.
* The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."
* In some cases, cache replicas could reject some Git operations on recently updated repositories. For more information about repository caching, see "[About repository caching](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."
* You can now configure the global announcement banner to be dismissable using the REST API.

  + The contents of the `github/codeql-go` repository have moved to the `github/codeql` repository, to live alongside similar libraries for all other programming languages supported by CodeQL. The open-source CodeQL queries, libraries, and extractor for analyzing codebases written in the Go programming language with GitHub's CodeQL code analysis tools can now be found in the new location. For more information, including guidance on migrating your existing workflows, see [github/codeql-go#741](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/issues/741).
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + Enterprise owners on instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license can see an overview of Dependabot alerts for the entire instance, including a repository-centric view of application security risks, and an alert-centric view of all secret scanning and Dependabot alerts. The views are in beta and subject to change, and alert-centric views for code scanning are planned for a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."
  + Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen or dismiss the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

    - **Note**: This feature is unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0. The feature is available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0 and later. [Updated: 2022-10-19]
  + Dependabot updates `@types` dependencies alongside corresponding packages in TypeScript projects. Before this change, users would see separate pull requests for a package and the corresponding `@types` package. This feature is automatically enabled for repositories containing `@types` packages in the project's `devDependencies` within the *package.json* file. You can disable this behavior by setting the [`ignore`](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#ignore) field in your `dependabot.yml` file to `@types/*`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the *dependabot.yml* file](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file)."
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + GitHub Actions can enforce dependency reviews on users' pull requests by scanning for dependencies, and will warn users about associated security vulnerabilities. The `dependency-review-action` action is supported by a new API endpoint that diffs the dependencies between any two revisions. For more information, see "[About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#dependency-review-enforcement)."
  + The dependency graph detects *Cargo.toml* and *Cargo.lock* files for Rust. These files will be displayed in the **Dependency graph** section of the **Insights** tab. Users will receive Dependabot alerts and updates for vulnerabilities associated with their Rust dependencies. Package metadata, including mapping packages to repositories, will be added at a later date. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."
  + If GitHub Connect is enabled for your instance, users can contribute an improvement to a security advisory in the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). To contribute, click **Suggest improvements for this vulnerability** while viewing an advisory's details. For more information, see the following articles.

* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + Within a workflow that calls a reusable workflow, users can pass the secrets to the reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-inputs-and-secrets-in-a-reusable-workflow)."
  + When using GitHub Actions, to reduce the risk of merging a change that was not reviewed by another person into a protected branch, enterprise owners and repository administrators can prevent Actions from creating pull requests. Organization owners could previously enable this restriction. For more information, see the following articles.

    - "[Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
    - "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
    - "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
  + Users can write a single workflow triggered by `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call`, and use the `inputs` context to access input values. Previously, `workflow_dispatch` inputs were in the event payload, which increased difficulty for workflow authors who wanted to write one workflow that was both reusable and manually triggered. For workflows triggered by `workflow_dispatch`, inputs are still available in the `github.event.inputs` context to maintain compatibility. For more information, see "[Contexts](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#inputs-context)."
  + To summarize the result of a job, users can generate Markdown and publish the contents as a job summary. For example, after running tests with GitHub Actions, a summary can provide an overview of passed, failed, or skipped tests, potentially reducing the need to review the full log output. For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary)."
  + To more easily diagnose job execution failures during a workflow re-run, users can enable debug logging, which outputs information about a job's execution and environment. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)" and "[Using workflow run logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures)."
  + If you manage self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions, you can ensure a consistent state on the runner itself before and after a workflow run by defining scripts to execute. By using scripts, you no longer need to require that users manually incorporate these steps into workflows. Pre- and post-job scripts are in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Running scripts before or after a job](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job)."
* #### [GitHub Packages](#github-packages)

  + Enterprise owners can migrate container images from the GitHub Docker registry to the GitHub Container registry. The Container registry provides the following benefits.

    - Improves the sharing of containers within an organization
    - Allows the application of granular access permissions
    - Permits the anonymous sharing of public container images
    - Implements OCI standards for hosting Docker images

    The Container registry is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Migrating your enterprise to the Container registry from the Docker registry](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/packages/migrating-your-enterprise-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry)."
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + GitHub Discussions is available for GitHub Enterprise Server. GitHub Discussions provides a central gathering space to ask questions, share ideas, and build connections. For more information, see "[GitHub Discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/discussions)."
  + Enterprise owners can configure a policy to control whether people's usernames or full names are displayed within internal or public repositories. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-the-display-of-member-names-in-your-repositories)."
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + Users can create member-only READMEs for an organization. For more information, see "[Customizing your organization's profile](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)."
  + Organization owners can pin a repository to an organization's profile directly from the repository via the new **Pin repository** dropdown. Pinned public repositories appear to all users of your instance, while public, private, and internal repositories are only visible to organization members.
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + While creating a fork, users can customize the fork's name. For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."
  + Users can delete a branch that's associated with an open pull request. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)."
  + Repositories with multiple licenses display all of the licenses in the "About" sidebar on the  **Code** tab. For more information, see "[Licensing a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)."
  + Users can require a successful deployment of a branch before anyone can merge the pull request associated with the branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-deployments-to-succeed-before-merging)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
  + Enterprise owners can prevent organization owners from inviting collaborators to repositories on the instance. For more information, see "[Enforcing a policy for inviting collaborators to repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-collaborators-to-repositories)."
  + Users can grant exceptions to GitHub Apps for any branch protection rule that supports exceptions. For more information, see "[About apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
* #### [Commits](#commits)

  + For public GPG signing keys that are expired or revoked, GitHub Enterprise Server verifies Git commit signatures and show commits as verified if the user made the commit while the key was still valid. Users can also upload expired or revoked GPG keys. For more information, see "[About commit signature verification](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)."
  + To affirm that a commit complies with the rules and licensing governing a repository, organization owners and repository administrators can now require developers to sign off on commits made through the web interface. For more information, see "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-organization)" and "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository)."
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Using the file tree located in the **Files changed** tab of a pull request, users can navigate modified files, understand the size and scope of changes, and focus reviews. The file tree appears if a pull request modifies at least two files, and the browser window is sufficiently wide. For more information, see "[Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)" and "[Filtering files in a pull request](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/filtering-files-in-a-pull-request)."
  + Users can default to using pull requests titles as the commit message for all squash merges. For more information, see "[Configuring commit squashing for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests)."
* #### [GitHub Mobile](#github-mobile)

  + In GitHub Mobile for iOS 1.80.0 and later, users can edit files within a pull request's topic branch. Support for editing files will come to GitHub Mobile for Android in a future release. [Updated: 2022-09-13]
* #### [Releases](#releases)

  + When viewing the details for a particular release, users can see the creation date for each release asset. For more information, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."
  + While creating a release with automatically generated release notes, users can see the tag identified as the previous release, then choose to select a different tag to specify as the previous release. For more information, see "[Automatically generated release notes](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Editing Markdown in the web interface has been improved.

    - After a user selects text and pastes a URL, the selected text will become a Markdown link to the pasted URL.
    - When a user pastes spreadsheet cells or HTML tables, the resulting text will render as a table.
    - When a user copies text containing links, the pasted text will include the link as a Markdown link.

    For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)."
  + When editing a Markdown file in the web interface, clicking the **Preview** tab will automatically scroll to the place in the preview that you were editing. The scroll location is based on the position of your cursor before you clicked the **Preview** tab.
### [3.6.0: Changes](#3.6.0-changes)

* The unencrypted and unauthenticated Git protocol is now disabled by default. If you do not re-enable the protocol after you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, `git://` connections on port 9418 will return the following error.

  ```
  The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported.

  ```

  If you wish to support the protocol in your environment, you must manually re-enable the feature. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#configuring-anonymous-git-read-access)" and the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-28-improving-git-protocol-security-on-github-enterprise-server/). [Updated: 2023-01-31]
* Interactive elements in the web interface such as links and buttons show a visible outline when focused with a keyboard, to help users find the current position on a page. In addition, when focused, form fields have a higher contrast outline.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.0: Known issues](#3.6.0-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch release.

  [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* After upgrading a replica node to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0 or later and restarting replication, Git replication may stop progressing and continue to show `WARNING: git replication is behind the primary …`. If you encounter this known issue, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket). [Updated: 2022-10-03]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* On an instance configured for SAML authentication, when signing in, users may erroneously see an error indicating "User has already been taken." [Updated: 2023-07-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
### [3.6.0: Deprecations](#3.6.0-deprecations)

* #### [Changes to supported SSH algorithms](#changes-to-supported-ssh-algorithms)

  + In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 and later, GitHub is changing the supported algorithms and hash functions for Git operations over SSH. By default, SSH connections that satisfy **both** of the following conditions will fail.

    - The RSA key was added to a user account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance after the cutoff date of midnight UTC on August 1, 2022.
    - The SSH client signs the connection attempt with the SHA-1 hash function.

    You can adjust the cutoff date. For more information, see "[Configuring SSH connections to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-ssh-connections-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-01-31]
### [3.6.0: Errata](#3.6.0-errata)

* "[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
* The "Changes" section of these release notes indicated that if a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved. This change is not available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, but is available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later. [Updated: 2023-09-06]

## Enterprise Server 3.7.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.19/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.19: Security fixes](#3.7.19-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4. [Updated 2024-01-03]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.19: Bug fixes](#3.7.19-bugs)

* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* A missing executable on the PATH caused the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command to fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.7.19: Changes](#3.7.19-changes)

* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.7.19: Known issues](#3.7.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The upgrade of `HAProxy` to version `2.8.4` (to address scenarios that could
  lead to denial of service) is causing elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.7.19 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.7.18 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
### [3.7.19: Deprecations](#3.7.19-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.18/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.18: Security fixes](#3.7.18-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.18: Bug fixes](#3.7.18-bugs)

* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.7.18: Changes](#3.7.18-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
### [3.7.18: Known issues](#3.7.18-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.

### [3.7.17: Security fixes](#3.7.17-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.17: Bug fixes](#3.7.17-bugs)

* When displaying a list of subdomains in the Management Console, the list included the outdated `render` subdomain, and excluded the newer `containers`, `docker`, `notebook`, and `viewscreen` subdomains.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
* Duplicated intermediate commit trailers wont appear in pull request squash messages.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* When viewing git blame data, the reviewer menu was loaded even when the suggested reviewer calculation timed out.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.7.17: Changes](#3.7.17-changes)

* Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.

* Issues with cross references to pull requests from deleted accounts would not load.
* The site admin page for organizations erroneously included a "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link.
* The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.7.15: Changes](#3.7.15-changes)

* The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
* Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.7.15: Known issues](#3.7.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]

## Enterprise Server 3.7.13

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.13/download)

July 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.13: Security fixes](#3.7.13-security-fixes)

* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.7.13: Bug fixes](#3.7.13-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with custom firewall rules defined, a configuration run with `ghe-config-apply` could take longer than expected.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* When an administrator updated an instance's TLS certificate via the API as a query parameter instead of in the request body, the certificate and key appeared in `unicorn.log`.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
* After a migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer, some repository autolink references were created with an incorrect format.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, a committer would not receive an email notification for a secret scanning alert where push protections were bypassed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user filtered by a custom pattern on an organizations "Code & security analysis" page using an invalid query, the entire GitHub Advanced Security disappeared and an error reading "Sorry, something went wrong loading GitHub Advanced Security settings" appeared.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
* The audit log reported the incorrect target repository for pre-receive hook failures.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, when using the `spokesctl` command-line utility to manage repositories with replicas that failed to fully create, the utility would spuriously attempt to repair healthy replicas.
### [3.7.13: Changes](#3.7.13-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* During initialization of a cluster configuration, output from the `ghe-cluster-config-init` command-line utility is improved and simplified.
* On an instance with 170 or fewer vCPUs, the default for `app.babeld.threads-max` is 512 instead of 3 times the number of vCPUs. The monitor dashboard also includes metrics within the "Babeld threads" section.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
### [3.7.13: Known issues](#3.7.13-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role for an organization could not view GitHub Advanced Security settings for the organization.
* If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, alerts were erroneously hidden when different vulnerabilities were detected by multiple build-time submission detectors.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.7.10: Changes](#3.7.10-changes)

* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, background services can handle more traffic.
* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.
### [3.7.10: Known issues](#3.7.10-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories.
* On an instance with audit log streaming enabled, the `driftwood` service does not start, preventing the normal operation of audit log streaming. [Updated: 2023-06-06]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]

### [3.7.9: Security fixes](#3.7.9-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
### [3.7.9: Bug fixes](#3.7.9-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* Download requests for Git LFS objects did not complete until reporting the final download size, which affected the latency of these requests, particularly on an instance with nodes functioning as repository caches.
* For instances with both GitHub Connect and automatic access to GitHub.com actions enabled, Dependabot would fail to update actions hosted on GitHub.com.
* In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com.
* After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instance's list of organizations.
* Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
### [3.7.9: Changes](#3.7.9-changes)

* If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
### [3.7.9: Known issues](#3.7.9-known-issues)

## Enterprise Server 3.7.8

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.8](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.8/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.8: Security fixes](#3.7.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.7.8: Bug fixes](#3.7.8-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* On instances configured to use the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, users' authentication with SSH keys and personal access tokens failed due to an erroneous requirement for authorization.
* After a user imported a repository with push protection enabled, the repository was not immediately visible in the security overview's "Security Coverage" view.
* Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* In some cases on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server erroneously stopped writing to replica fileservers, causing repository data to fall out of sync.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table.
* An enterprise owner could not enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an instance if any enterprise owners had not enabled 2FA for their user accounts. [Updated: 2023-04-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Packages enabled, after users pushed to the Container registry, the instance erroneously responded with a `429 Too Many Requests` error in cases when the instance could accommodate the request. The limits have been raised, and users should receive this message less often. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
### [3.7.8: Changes](#3.7.8-changes)

* When the dependency submission API received a submission with one or more dependencies without a version, the dependency graph will now correctly report this fact.
* To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each node matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
### [3.7.8: Known issues](#3.7.8-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`.

[Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`.

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.6/download)

February 16, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.6: Security fixes](#3.7.6-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.39.2, which address [CVE-2023-22490](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gw92-x3fm-3g3q) and [CVE-2023-23946](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-r87m-v37r-cwfh).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22380](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22380).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.6: Bug fixes](#3.7.6-bugs)

* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* For instances with both GitHub Connect and automatic access to GitHub.com actions enabled, Dependabot would fail to update actions hosted on GitHub.com.
* The CSV file containing details about GitHub Advanced Security contributors could not be downloaded if the instance did not have a GitHub Advanced Security license.
* Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table.
### [3.7.6: Changes](#3.7.6-changes)

* After the Dependency submission REST API receives a submission with one or more dependencies without a version, the dependency graph will now correctly report this fact.
### [3.7.6: Known issues](#3.7.6-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In some cases, while converting an issue to a discussion, the conversion process may hang. In this situation, an enterprise owner can try the following troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

  1. At the end of the stuck discussion's URL, note the discussion's number.
  2. In the web UI, browse to the repository where the conversion is stuck.

### [3.7.5: Security fixes](#3.7.5-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.5: Bug fixes](#3.7.5-bugs)

* After a site administrator adjusted the cutoff date for allowing SSH connections with RSA keys using `ghe-config app.gitauth.rsa-sha1`, the instance would still disallow connections with RSA keys if the connection attempt was signed by the SHA-1 hash function.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* After disabling Dependabot updates, the avatar for Dependabot was displayed as the **@ghost** user in the Dependabot alert timeline.
* In some cases, users could experience a `500` error when viewing the **Code security & analysis** settings page for an instance with a very high number of active committers.
* Some links to contact GitHub Support or view the GitHub Enterprise Server release notes were incorrect.
* The additional committers count for GitHub Advanced Security always showed 0.
* In some cases, users were unable to convert existing issues to discussions. If an issue is stuck while being converted to a discussion, enterprise owners can review the "Known issues" section below for more information.

### [3.7.3: Security fixes](#3.7.3-security-fixes)

* Sanitize additional secrets in support bundles and the configuration log.
* Dependencies for the CodeQL action have been updated to the latest security versions.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.3: Bug fixes](#3.7.3-bugs)

* Some services incorrectly connected directly to kafka-lite instead of through its internal proxy. In a cluster environment where web services and job services execute on separate nodes, messages generated from the Insights job service werent delivered to kafka-lite.
* The metrics `Active workers` and `Queued requests` for `github` (renamed from metadata), `gitauth`, and `unicorn` container services werent correctly read from collectd and displayed in the Management Console.
* Dependabot Alert emails would be sent to disabled repositories.
* Data migrations could fail when the underlying database table contained only a single record.
* Sorting and filtering the list of custom patterns for secret scanning at the organization level did not work correctly.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, viewing the security settings page for an organization or repository could result in a `500` error due to a GitHub Advanced Security backfill job not completing before the upgrade started.
* The `git-janitor`command was unable to fix outdated `multi-pack-index.lock` files, resulting in the repository failing maintenance.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
* When updating custom patterns, the pattern state was immediately set to published.
### [3.7.3: Changes](#3.7.3-changes)

* Improved the reliability of the real time updates service (Alive) to make it more resilient against network issues with Redis.
* The `ghe-support-bundle` and `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` commands were updated to include the `-p/--period` flag to generate a time constrained support bundle. The duration can be specified in days and hours, for example: `-p '2 hours'`, `-p '1 day'`, `-p '2 days 5 hours'`.
* When upgrading an instance with a new root partition, running the `ghe-upgrade` command with the `-t/--target` option ensures the preflight check for the minimum disk storage size is executed against the target partition.
* The performance of configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` has been improved.
* When exporting account data, backing up a repository, or performing a migration, the link to a repository archive now expires after 1 hour. Previously the archive link expired after 5 minutes.
### [3.7.3: Known issues](#3.7.3-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

## Enterprise Server 3.7.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.2/download)

December 13, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.2: Security fixes](#3.7.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
### [3.7.2: Bug fixes](#3.7.2-bugs)

* A race condition blocked upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later until a site administrator retried the upgrade.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-status` command on a cache replica via the administrative shell (SSH), the command incorrectly reported overall Git and Alambic cluster replication status information as if it pertained only to cache replication.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* In a high availability configuration, after promotion of a replica to be the primary node, a site administrator could not force replication to stop on a secondary replica node using the `ghe-repl-stop -f` command.
* When using repository caching with an instance in a high availability configuration, if a Git client used SSH instead of HTTPS for a repositorys remote URL, Git LFS would fetch objects from the instances primary node instead of the appropriate cache replica node.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* In some cases, searches via the API returned a `500` error.
* Adding a collaborator to a user-owned fork of a private, organization-owned repository with triage, maintain, or custom access resulted in a `500` error.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* Dismissing a Dependabot alert that contained certain characters could result in a `400` error.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, the **Configure SSO** dropdown menu appeared erroneously for personal access tokens and SSH keys.
* An upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 to 3.7 could fail because the instance had not yet purged deleted repositories.
* In a high availability or repository caching configuration, Unicorn services on nodes other than the primary node were unable to send log events to the primary node.
* Fixes a bug in which a GHES log file could get filled very quickly and cause the root drive to run out of free space.
* When viewing code scanning results for Ruby, an erroneous beta label appeared.
### [3.7.2: Changes](#3.7.2-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot alerts, GitHub Enterprise Server enqueues the synchronization of advisory data to ensure hourly updates from GitHub.com.
* A user's list of recently accessed repositories no longer includes deleted repositories.
* For participants in the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, custom mappings for SAML user attributes are now supported. Custom mappings allow the use of a value other than `NameID` as the unique identifying claim during SAML authentication. For more information, see "[Configuring user provisioning with SCIM for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-user-provisioning-with-scim-for-your-enterprise#about-identities-and-claims)." [Updated: 2023-02-27]
### [3.7.2: Known issues](#3.7.2-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`.

For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* When validating domain settings on an instance with TLS and subdomain isolation enabled, the Management Console does not display GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7's two new subdomains, `http(s)://notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `http(s)://viewscreen.HOSTNAME`, in the list of domains. [Updated: 2023-01-12]
* For participants in the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, authentication for requests to resources other than the REST API using a personal access token or SSH key may not succeed. A fix will be available in a forthcoming release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-02-27]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]

### [3.7.1: Security fixes](#3.7.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper neutralization of argument delimiters in a command vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that enabled remote code execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. This bug was originally reported via GitHub's Bug Bounty program and assigned [CVE-2022-23740](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23740). [Updated: 2022-12-02]
* **HIGH**: A check was added within Pages to ensure the working directory is clean before unpacking new content to prevent an arbitrary file overwrite bug. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-46255](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46255).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Scoped user-to-server tokens from GitHub Apps could bypass authorization checks in GraphQL API requests when accessing non-repository resources. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23739).
* **MEDIUM**: Pull request preview links did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing a malicious user to embed dangerous links in the instances web UI. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
### [3.7.1: Bug fixes](#3.7.1-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* Running the `ghe-spokesctl` command returned a `failed to get repo metrics` error.
* Setting the maintenance mode with an IP Exception List would not persist across upgrades.
* GitHub Pages builds could time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability.
* Status details for the replication of Git LFS objects to repository cache replica nodes were not visible in the `ghe-repl-status` output on those nodes.
* The audit log timestamp for Dependabot alert events returned the creation date of the alert instead of the timestamp when a user took action on the alert.
* When accessing an instances JavaScript resources from behind a proxy, the browser displayed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.
* If a user named a status check with leading or trailing spaces, the instance created a duplicate check if another check existed with the same name and no leading or trailing spaces.
* If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook.
* In some cases, an instance could replace an active repository with a deleted repository.
* Git LFS objects in a repository with a cache replication policy would not be copied to cache replicas if the total number of objects in the repository exceeded 5,000.
* After running migrations for the GitHub Enterprise Importer on an instance configured for high availability, replication of migration storage assets would not catch up.
* Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container.
* On an instance with GitHub Packages configured, package upload and installation could fail for customers using a VPC endpoint URL for AWS S3 blob storage.
* In some cases, after upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0, users may encounter `Internal Server Error` or `500` errors when initiating Git operations over SSH or HTTPS.
### [3.7.1: Changes](#3.7.1-changes)

* If a site administrator has not yet configured GitHub Actions for the instance, the UI for setting up code scanning will prompt the user to configure GitHub Actions.
* To avoid failing domain verification due to the 63-character limit enforced by DNS providers for DNS records, the GitHub-generated `TXT` record to verify domain ownership is now limited to 63 characters.
### [3.7.1: Known issues](#3.7.1-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.7.0: Features](#3.7.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + To increase the security of the Management Console, site administrators can configure the rate limit for sign-in attempts, as well as the lockout duration after exceeding the rate limit. For more information, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits#configuring-rate-limits-for-authentication-to-the-management-console)."
  + The minimum password requirements for the Management Console are more stringent.
  + Attempts to authenticate to the Management Console and changes made by a site administrator within the Management Console are written to a log file in `/var/log/enterprise-manage/audit.log`.
* #### [Instance services](#instance-services)

  + Azure Maps replaces MapBox for rendering GeoJSON files as graphical maps. Administrators can enable map rendering and provide an Azure Maps token in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Administering your instance from the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console)."
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + Users can verify commits using an SSH public key. For more information, see "[About commit signature verification](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification)."
  + Site administrators can provision users and groups on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance automatically with SCIM. SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server is in private beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Configuring user provisioning with SCIM for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-user-provisioning-with-scim-for-your-enterprise)" and "[SCIM](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/enterprise-admin/scim)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can view and comment on code scanning alerts in their repository within a pull request's **Conversation** tab. If the **Require conversation resolution before merging** branch protection rule is enabled for the repository, all comments on these code scanning alerts must be resolved before a user merges the pull request. For more information, see "[About code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning#about-code-scanning)," "[About pull request reviews](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)," and "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-conversation-resolution-before-merging)."
  + To simplify the rollout of secret scanning for instances with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of organizations, enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can enable secret scanning and push protection for the instance using the web interface. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Advanced Security features for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/managing-github-advanced-security-features-for-your-enterprise)."
  + Organization owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can perform a dry run of custom patterns for secret scanning for all repositories within an organization. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + If a site administrator has enabled email notifications for an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users who watch a repository's secret scanning alerts will receive an email notification when a contributor bypasses a secret blocked by push protection. Previously, notifications were not sent if the secret was marked as a false positive or used in tests. For more information, see "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)" and "[Configuring email for notifications](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-email-for-notifications)."
  + To ease the management of dozens or hundreds of custom patterns for secret scanning, users, organization owners, or enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can sort and filter the list of patterns for a repository, organization, or the entire instance. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license who protect pushes with secret scanning can specify a custom link that will display in the error message when push protection detects and blocks a potential secret. For more information, see "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)."
  + Users can publish CodeQL packs to the Container registry. For more information, see [Creating and working with CodeQL packs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs/) in the CodeQL CLI documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use CodeQL packs with code scanning, including packs that are published to the instance's GitHub Container registry. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#downloading-codeql-packs-from-github-enterprise-server)" and [Publishing and using CodeQL packs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/publishing-and-using-codeql-packs/)" in the CodeQL CLI documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can exclude unnecessary CodeQL queries for code scanning by using query filters. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#about-code-scanning-configuration)."

The new endpoint supplements the existing endpoints for repositories and organizations. For more information, see "[Code Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-an-enterprise)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Organization owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can retrieve the enablement status or configure the automatic enablement of the following features using the REST API.

    - GitHub Advanced Security
    - Secret scanning
    - Push protection

    For more information, see "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/orgs/orgs#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use cursors to paginate secret scanning alert results retrieved with the REST API's organization and repository endpoints. For more information, see "[Secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/secret-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + The security overview for the instance includes information about Dependabot. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."
  + Users can see more information about the activity associated with a Dependabot alert. Within the details for a Dependabot alert, users can see a timeline of events, such as when the alert was opened, fixed, or reopened. Events will also show additional metadata when available, like relevant pull requests. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)."
  + Users' Dependabot alerts are sorted by importance by default. Importance considers CVSS as the primary factor, as well as potential risk, relevancy, and ease of fixing the vulnerability. The calculation will improve over time.
  + Users can sort Dependabot alerts by the scope of the dependency, either runtime or development.
  + Users can optionally add a comment when dismissing a Dependabot alert. Dismissal comments appear in the event timeline and within the `dismissComment` field in the GraphQL API's `RepositoryVulnerabilityAlert` object. For more information about the GraphQL API, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/graphql/reference/objects#repositoryvulnerabilityalert)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
  + Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once.
  + Organization owners on an instance can retrieve the enablement status or configure the automatic enablement of the following features for dependency management using the REST API.

* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + Enterprise owners, organization owners, and security managers can access a centralized view of risk across the entire instance. The view also includes an alert-centric view of all code scanning, secret scanning, and Dependabot alerts. Enterprise owners can view alerts for organizations that they are owners of. Organization owners and security managers can view repositories and alerts for the organizations that they have full access to. For more information, see "[About the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/security-overview/about-the-security-overview)."
  + Organization owners can manage teams of security managers using the REST API. For more information, see "[Security Managers](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/orgs/security-managers)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users of the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) can now see advisories for GitHub Actions vulnerabilities. For more information, see "[Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database)."
  + Users can populate a repository's dependency graph by submitting the dependencies for the repository using the REST API. The dependency graph powers Dependabot alerts and Dependabot security updates. For more information, see "[Using the Dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)."
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + GitHub Actions supports Google Cloud Storage as a storage provider for logs, artifacts, and caches. For more information, see "[Enabling GitHub Actions with Google Cloud Storage](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/enabling-github-actions-with-google-cloud-storage)."
  + GitHub Actions users who use dependency caching to speed up workflows can now use the GitHub CLI to manage the GitHub Actions cache for a repository. To manage caches using the GitHub CLI, install the `gh-actions-cache` extension. For more information, see the [`gh-actions-cache` documentation](https://github.com/actions/gh-actions-cache#readme).
  + Workflow re-runs in GitHub Actions use the actor who initially triggered the workflow for privilege evaluation. The actor who triggered the re-run will continue to be displayed in the UI, and can be accessed in a workflow via the `triggering_actor` field in the `github` context. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)" and "[Contexts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)."
  + Users can call reusable workflows from a matrix or other reusable workflows. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-reusable-workflows)."
  + When querying GitHub Actions for artifacts, the REST API returns information about the run and branch that produced the artifact. For more information, see "[GitHub Actions Artifacts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/artifacts)" in the REST API documentation.
  + To support secure cloud deployments at scale, organization owners and repository administrators can complete the following tasks with the OpenID Connect REST API. For more information, see "[GitHub Actions OIDC](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/oidc)" in the REST API documentation

    - Enable a standard OpenID Connect configuration across cloud deployment workflows by customizing the `subject` claim format.
    - Ensure additional compliance and security for OpenID Connect deployments by appending the `issuer` URL with the enterprise's slug.
    - Configure advanced OpenID Connect policies by using additional OpenID Connect token claims like `repository_id` and `repo_visibility`.

    For more information, see "[About security hardening with OpenID Connect](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token)."
  + GitHub Actions users who use dependency caching to speed up workflows can now use the GitHub Actions Cache REST API to accomplish the following tasks.

    - List all caches within a repository and sort by metadata.
    - Delete a corrupt or stale cache entry.
      For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#managing-caches)" and "[GitHub Actions Cache](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/cache)" in the REST API documentation.
  + If a non-ephemeral self-hosted GitHub Actions runner does not communicate with the GitHub Enterprise Server instance for more than 14 days, the instance will automatically remove the runner. If an ephemeral self-hosted runner does not communicate with the instance for more than one day, the instance will automatically remove the runner. Previously, GitHub Enterprise Server removed runners after 30 days. For more information, see "[About self-hosted runners](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#about-self-hosted-runners)."
  + GitHub Actions can run self-hosted macOS workflows in a macOS ARM64 runtime with [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) support for Apple silicon, such as the M1 or M2 chip. For more information, see "[Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow#using-default-labels-to-route-jobs)."
* #### [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)

  + Users can deploy a GitHub Pages site directly from a repository using GitHub Actions, without configuration of a publishing source. Using GitHub Actions provides control over the authoring framework and version, as well as more control over the publishing process with features like deployment gates. For more information, see "[Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site)."
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Enterprise owners can prevent users from creating repositories owned by their user accounts. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-repository-creation)."
  + Enterprise owners can control where users can fork repositories. Forking can be limited to preset combinations of organizations, the same organization as the parent repository, user accounts, or everywhere. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-forking-private-or-internal-repositories)."
  + Repository administrators can block potentially destructive pushes by limiting the number of branches and tags that can be updated by a single push. By default, there is no limit to the number of branches and tags that can be updated in a single push. For more information, see "[Managing the push policy for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-push-policy-for-your-repository)."
  + Users can further customize the default commit message when squash-merging a pull request. For more information, see "[Configuring commit merging for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-merging-for-pull-requests)" and "[Configuring commit squashing for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests)."
  + Users can create a branch from a repository's **Branches** overview page by clicking the **New branch** button. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch)."
  + When a user renames or moves a file to a new directory, if at least half of the file's contents are identical, the commit history indicates that the file was renamed, similar to `git log --follow`. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-06-view-commit-history-across-file-renames-and-moves/). [Updated: 2023-02-10]
  + Improvements have been made to the creation and management of forks.

    - When forking a repository, users can choose to only include the repository's default branch in the fork.
    - Users can use a repository's' **Fork** button to see existing forks of the repository.
    - The **Fetch upstream** button has been renamed to **Sync fork** to better describe the button's behavior. If the sync causes a conflict, the web UI prompts the user to contribute changes to the parent repository, discard changes, or resolve the conflict.
    - To address situations where people work within one organization and don't want to fork a repository to a different organization or user account, users can fork a repository to the same organization as the parent repository.
    - Users can fork an internal repository to another organization and the fork will retain internal visibility. When forking an internal repository, users can choose which organization should own the fork.

    For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."
  + Repository administrators can block the creation of branches that match a configured name pattern with the **Restrict pushes that create matching branches** branch protection rule. For example, if a repository's default branch changes from `master` to `main`, a repository administrator can prevent any subsequent creation or push of the `master` branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule)."
  + Users can create files with geoJSON, topoJSON, and STL diagrams and render the diagrams in the web interface. For more information, see "[Working with non-code files](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files)."
  + Users can create autolink references using either alphanumeric or numeric identifiers. For more information, see "[Configuring autolinks to reference external resources autolinks](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."
  + Users can customize exclusions in the file finder like `vendor/` and `build/` by using `linguist` attributes in a `.gitattributes` file. For more information, see "[Finding files on GitHub](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/search-github/searching-on-github/finding-files-on-github#customizing-excluded-files)" and "[Customizing how changed files appear on GitHub](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github)."
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Users can browse the files modified in an individual commit using the tree view. For more information, see "[About commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits#using-the-file-tree)."
* #### [Issues](#issues)

  + Users can manually link existing branches or pull requests to an issue from the "Development" section in the issue's sidebar. For more information, see "[Linking a pull request to an issue](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-or-branch-to-an-issue-using-the-issue-sidebar)."
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Users can use Mermaid syntax when writing Markdown, which displays a diagram when rendering the Markdown. For more information, see "[Creating diagrams](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)."
  + Users can write mathematical expressions using fenced code blocks with the `math` syntax in addition to the existing delimiters. `$$` is not required with this method. For more information, see "[Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)."

    - **Note**: This feature is unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7. The feature will be available in an upcoming release. [Updated: 2022-11-16]
  + Users can render maps directly in Markdown using fenced code blocks with the `geojson` or `topojson` syntax, and embed STL 3D renders using `stl` syntax. For more information, see "[Creating diagrams](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)."
  + In Markdown, users can write LaTeX-style syntax to render math expressions inline using `$` delimiters, or in blocks using `$$` delimiters. For more information, see "[Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)."
### [3.7.0: Changes](#3.7.0-changes)

* To improve stability, the service for rendering GeoJSON, Jupyter Notebook, PDF, PSD, SVG, SolidWorks, and other binary formats has been replaced.
* If TLS and subdomain isolation are configured for your instance and your certificate is not a wildcard certificate, you must generate a new certificate that includes the additional subdomains for these services, `notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `viewscreen.HOSTNAME`. For more information, see "[Enabling subdomain isolation](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/enabling-subdomain-isolation)." [Updated: 2022-12-02]
* Secret scanning no longer supports custom patterns that use `.*` as an end delimiter in the "After secret" field, as the pattern syntax would cause scan problems and inconsistencies.
* When creating a new release, users can now submit the form using `Ctrl` + `Enter` in macOS, or `Ctrl` + `Enter` in Windows or Linux.
* The **Wiki** tab in a repository only appears when a wiki exists. Previously, the tab always appeared.
* Rendered wikis display mathematical expressions and Mermaid diagrams.
* The size of the search field for user, organization, and enterprise audit logs has increased.
* The maximum number of self-hosted runners in a runner group is limited to 10,000. Previously, there was no limit. [Updated: 2023-05-24]
* If a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved. [Updated: 2023-09-06]
### [3.7.0: Known issues](#3.7.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* In some cases after upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0, users may encounter `Internal Server Error` or `500` errors when initiating `git` operations over SSH or HTTPS. Example:

  ```
  git push origin master
  Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  remote: Internal Server Error
  To ghes.hostname.com:User/repo.git
  ! [remote rejected]       master -> master (Internal Server Error)

  ```

  If these are encountered, please [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) with a support bundle. The known temporary workaround at this time is to restart the `github-gitauth` service with the commands below:

  ```
  nomad stop github-gitauth
  nomad run /etc/nomad-jobs/github/gitauth.hcl
  nomad status github-gitauth

  ```

  We are currently investigating a permanent fix for a future hot patch [Updated: 2022-11-24].
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* When validating domain settings on an instance with TLS and subdomain isolation enabled, the Management Console does not display GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7's two new subdomains, `http(s)://notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `http(s)://viewscreen.HOSTNAME`, in the list of domains. [Updated: 2023-01-12]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, site administrators should only run the `ghe-repl-start` and `ghe-repl-stop` commands while the instance is in maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode)" and "[About high availability configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/about-high-availability-configuration#utilities-for-replication-management)." [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
### [3.7.0: Deprecations](#3.7.0-deprecations)

* **Upcoming deprecation**: In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and later, unsecure algorithms will be disabled for SSH connections to the administrative shell.
* Commit comments, which are comments that users add directly to a commit outside of a pull request, no longer appear in the pull request timeline. Users could not reply to or resolve these comments. The Timeline events REST API and the GraphQL API's `PullRequest` object also no longer return commit comments.
* Diffing GeoJSON, PSD, and STL files is no longer possible.
* Package registries on the new GitHub Packages architecture, including Container registry and npm packages, no longer expose data through the GraphQL API. In a coming release, other GitHub Packages registries will migrate to the new architecture, which will deprecate the GraphQL API for those registries as well.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 and later, GitHub is changing the supported algorithms and hash functions for Git operations over SSH. By default, SSH connections that satisfy **both** of the following conditions will fail.

  + The RSA key was added to a user account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance after the cutoff date of midnight UTC on August 1, 2022.
  + The SSH client signs the connection attempt with the SHA-1 hash function.

  You can adjust the cutoff date. For more information, see "[Configuring SSH connections to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-ssh-connections-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-09-29]
### [3.7.0: Errata](#3.7.0-errata)

* "[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
* "[Features](#3.7.0-features)" incorrectly indicated that users of the GitHub Advisory Database can see advisories for both Elixir and malware. These features are unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, and will be available in a future release. [Updated 2023-08-21]
