- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Blocksy Companion plugin for WordPress versions 1.8.67 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into a website. These scripts are executed when a user visits the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious scripts that will execute in a user's browser when they access the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts. The required privilege is "Contributor," suggesting that an attacker with the Contributor role or higher can exploit this vulnerability.
