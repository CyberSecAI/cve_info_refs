Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `getItems()` function within the `visforms.php` file of the Visforms extension for Joomla!.
*   The `supportedFieldTypes` parameter, which is influenced by the user-supplied `addSupportedFieldType` parameter, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. User-controlled input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can interact with the database, potentially extracting sensitive information, modifying data, or deleting data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** The blog post mentions that under certain conditions, the vulnerability *could* lead to remote code execution, but it does not elaborate on how.
*   **Compromise of Web Application:** By exploiting the vulnerability, attackers can compromise the Joomla! application and its underlying data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is via HTTP requests. An attacker sends malicious SQL payloads through the `addSupportedFieldType` parameter when using a form generated by the vulnerable Visforms extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! site.
*   **Knowledge of Visforms:** While the exploit is not publicly detailed in the blog posts, the attacker needs to be able to trigger form submissions in the Visforms extension, or at least to understand where to pass the vulnerable parameter.
*   **No Special Privileges:** An attacker does not need any special privileges on the Joomla! application or the server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Visforms Base Package for Joomla! versions prior to 3.0.5 (specifically, in `com_visforms` versions 3.8.0 - 3.14.10, and Visforms Base Package 3.0.0 - 3.0.4).
*   The `visforms.php` file is located at `vfbase_j3.9.0_3.0.5\packages\com_visforms_j3.9.0_3.14.11.zip\site\models\visforms.php`, although this path may change in different versions.
*   The vendor has released a patch in version 3.0.5 to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David √Ålvarez Robles from AliSEC Soluciones S.L.
