### @WhatTheFuzz **[WhatTheFuzz](/WhatTheFuzz)** commented [Dec 16, 2022](#issue-1500928255)

Specific test cases can cause the program to both divide by zero and dereference a null pointer. The proposed PR is a minimal viable patch.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Floating Point Exception

## Overview

As a result of invalid input validation (CWE-233: Improper Handling of Parameters), specific files passed to the command line application, `crasm`, can lead to a divide by zero fault (CWE-369: Divide By Zero) in the function `opdiv`.

## About

`crasm` is a command line utility available on the Ubuntu package manager and [GitHub](https://github.com/colinbourassa/crasm) which assembles code for the 6800, 6801, 6803, 6502, 65C02, and Z80. At the time of writing, the current version is 1.8-3 on Ubuntu and commit [5471a9f](https://github.com/colinbourassa/crasm/commit/5471a9f991fa795a1e86568cf5b4433e6c169047) on GitHub.

## Vulnerability

The parameter `presult` and it's members are not checked prior to a division operation. As a result a floating point exception will occur with `value` is zero and subsequently divided by itself.

```
void opdiv(struct result* presult, struct result* parg)
{
  presult->flags |= parg->flags;
  checktype(presult, L_ABSOLUTE);
  checktype(parg, L_ABSOLUTE);
  presult->value /= parg->value;
}
```

### Affected versions

* 1.8-3 (as of writing, the current version) available on the Ubuntu package manager.
* Versions compiled from commit `932f3293f96f36bfe32f8d8d70a5ba693d3b3193` and below.

### Minimum Viable Patch

A patch was submitted to the maintainer and merged into the source repository with [merge request #7][crasm-pr] containing the patch below. The version installed with Ubuntu (22.10 and 22.04) remain vulnerable as of writing.

```

+  if (parg->value != 0)
+  {
+    presult->value /= parg->value;

 }

 void oprlist(struct result* presult, struct result* parg)
```

### Recommended Common Vulnerability Score

* Overall: 1.6
  + CVSS Base Score: 1.7
  + Impact Subscore: 1.4
  + Exploitability Subscore: 0.3

## Validation:

To validate the existence of the floating point exception, use the include test case to cause a fault. The file is passed in as the first argument to the program.
