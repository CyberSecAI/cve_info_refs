- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Admin Log plugin (<= 1.50) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of CSRF protection in the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows and what functionality the attacker can trigger.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, thus forcing the user's browser to execute actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a link or visiting a webpage with the malicious CSRF request. The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
