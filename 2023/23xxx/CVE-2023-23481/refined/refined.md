- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed by other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through stored malicious input in the application. When other users access the page or data containing the malicious script, the script will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into a part of the application where data is stored and then displayed to other users.
