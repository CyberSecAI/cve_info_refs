{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Toybox.Graphics.BufferedBitmap` object initialization does not properly handle integer overflows when calculating the buffer size, potentially leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability in memory allocation calculation",
      "Insufficient input validation"
     ],
    "impact": "A heap buffer overflow can occur due to the undersized memory allocation. This could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing specific width, height, and palette parameters to the `BufferedBitmap` constructor, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft an application or script that can call the `BufferedBitmap` constructor with the malicious parameters. This requires the ability to deploy and execute custom code on a Garmin device."
  },
  "additional_information": {
        "details": "The `total_bytes` calculation can overflow when `int_field_height * total_bytes_width` exceeds the maximum value, resulting in a small value. The allocated memory using `tvm_mem_alloc` will then be smaller than expected, leading to potential buffer overflows if the buffer is accessed using its expected dimensions."
