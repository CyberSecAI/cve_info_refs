### About usd Security Advisories

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/icon-hero.png "icon-hero")

In order to protect businesses against hackers and criminals, we always have to keep our skills and knowledge up to date. Thus, security research is just as important for our work as is building up a security community to promote the exchange of knowledge. After all, more security can only be achieved if many individuals take on the task.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications. In this context, the [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) publishes a series of papers on new vulnerabilities and current security issues.

Always for the sake of our mission: „more security.“
