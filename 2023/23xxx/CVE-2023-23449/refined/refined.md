Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-23449:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Observable Response Discrepancy

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR exhibits an observable response discrepancy. This means that the server's responses to certain requests or challenges differ in a way that can be analyzed to gain information.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can gain information about valid usernames by analyzing challenge responses from the server via the REST interface. This could potentially lead to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted remotely via the REST interface of the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the device's REST interface and analyze the responses. No prior authentication is required, and the attacker can be in a remote location.
