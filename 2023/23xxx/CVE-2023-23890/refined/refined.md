- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Airbnb Review Slider plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker could craft a malicious link or website and trick a logged-in administrator into clicking it, triggering unintended actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. The attacker does not require authentication but must target a privileged user.
