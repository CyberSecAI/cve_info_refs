Debian Security Advisory DSA-5470-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : python-werkzeug
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-23934 CVE-2023-25577
Debian Bug     : 1031370

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in python-werkzeug, a collection
of utilities for WSGI applications.

CVE-2023-23934

    It was discovered that Werkzeug did not properly handle the parsing
    of nameless cookies which may allow shadowing of other cookies.

CVE-2023-25577

    It was discovered that Werkzeug could parse unlimited number of
    parts, including file parts, which may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1+dfsg1-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-werkzeug packages.

For the detailed security status of python-werkzeug please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-werkzeug>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

## Package

pip

werkzeug
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=2.2.2

## Patched versions

2.2.3

## Description

Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain.

Werkzeug <= 2.2.2 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as `__Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
