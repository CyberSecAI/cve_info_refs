# DOS HAMT Decoding Panics

Moderate

published
GHSA-q264-w97q-q778
Feb 9, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.3

## Patched versions

0.4.3

## Description

### Impact

Trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.

If you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic.

This is caused by bogus `fanout` parameter in the HAMT directory nodes.

This include checks returned in [ipfs/go-bitfield GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r), as well as limiting the `fanout` to `<= 1024` (to avoid attempts of arbitrary sized allocations).

### Patches

* [dbcc43e](https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/commit/dbcc43ec3e2db0d01e8d80c55040bba3cf22cb4b)

### Workarounds

Do not feed untrusted user data to the decoding functions.
