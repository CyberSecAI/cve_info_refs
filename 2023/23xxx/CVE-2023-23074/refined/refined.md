**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-23074

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization/encoding within the "Advanced Portal" configurations of ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. Specifically, the application failed to encode user-supplied data before rendering it within the product tour or preview.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code could be injected through the Advanced Portal configurations. This injected script would then be stored and executed when other users view the product tour or preview.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could exploit this XSS vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking and account takeover.
    - Data theft.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Advanced Portal configurations" where an attacker can inject malicious javascript.
- The malicious script is then executed when users view the product tour or product tour preview.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the "Admin" role within the ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus application to access and modify the Advanced Portal settings and inject malicious javascript.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "HMs" via the bug bounty program
- The vulnerability was fixed by encoding data during client rendering, which prevents the execution of injected Javascript.
- Affected versions were 14103 and below. The fix was introduced in version 14104, released on Jan 24, 2023
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered "Low" by ManageEngine.
