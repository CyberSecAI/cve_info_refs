The provided content relates to CVE-2023-23024.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is stored in the database and subsequently displayed in the application's views. Specifically, the application directly inserts data received from POST requests (`$this->input->post()`) into the database without any input validation or output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application is vulnerable to both stored (persistent) XSS. This vulnerability stems from the fact that data saved in the `book` and `transaction` tables can contain malicious scripts, which will execute when a user views the corresponding data within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the web application
- Phishing attacks
- Stealing of sensitive information
- Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields (e.g., `book_title`, `year`, `publisher`, `writer`, `buyer_name`). When this data is retrieved from the database and displayed, the injected script will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit input to the vulnerable forms. This likely involves being an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify book or transaction records, but the specific requirements would depend on the permissions model of the application.
