Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-23956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Symantec SiteMinder Web Agent. The application displays user-supplied input from the URL (specifically query string parameters) in error messages without adequate filtering. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will then be executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The web agent is susceptible to XSS attacks because it renders user-provided input from the URL within the browser's context without proper encoding or filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially:
    *   Steal cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the page.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Potentially gain control of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the query parameters. The victim needs to click this manipulated link for the attack to be successful.
*   **User Interaction (UI):** The attack requires user interaction, as the victim must click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious URLs with embedded scripts.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to use social engineering tactics to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory suggests mitigation strategies, including:
    *   **HTML Encoding:** Using the `fcchtmlencoding` parameter to encode values inserted into FCC variables.
    *   **CSS Checking:** Enabling the `CSSChecking` parameter to scan URLs for potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Bad Character Configuration:** Utilizing parameters like `BadCSSChars`, `BadQueryChars`, and `BadUrlChars` to block specific characters in URLs and forms.
    *   **Valid Target Domain:** Using the `ValidTargetDomain` parameter to control redirects.
*   The advisory also mentions that the `BadCSSChars` parameter does not interpret double quotation marks (") entered as ASCII characters. To include it, you need to enter its hexadecimal equivalent (%22).
*   The vulnerability is present in Web Agent version 12.52 and possibly earlier versions.

In summary, CVE-2023-23956 is a medium-severity XSS vulnerability in Symantec SiteMinder Web Agent, stemming from insufficient input validation when displaying error messages in the browser. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts via URLs, potentially leading to various security breaches. The provided documentation details several configuration parameters that can be used to mitigate this vulnerability.
