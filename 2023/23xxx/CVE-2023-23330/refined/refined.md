Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23330:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when handling user-supplied file paths, specifically within the "file" parameter in a GET request used to download user manuals/guides. The application directly includes the file specified by the user without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI because it allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system. This is due to the application's flawed implementation of file inclusion, specifically the user-controlled "file" parameter in the GET request.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, including:
    *   Configuration files, potentially containing database credentials, API tokens, etc.
    *   Source code files
    *   System files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
    *   SSH private keys
    *   Log files
    *   Bash history
*   By gaining access to such sensitive information, an attacker can potentially escalate their privileges, pivot to other systems or perform further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to a specific page responsible for downloading user manuals. By manipulating the "file" parameter in the request, an attacker can specify a path to a local file they wish to access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This could be from any network location that has access to the application.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of file paths and how to construct relative file paths to traverse directories on the server to reach the target files.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was discovered in Amano Xoffice parking solution version 7.1 (7.1.3879).
* The vulnerability can be exploited by using relative path traversal (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`) to bypass the intended directory for manual files.
* The vendor's official website is [https://www.amano.eu/en/](https://www.amano.eu/en/)
* The discoverer also found another vulnerability, SQL injection CVE-2023â€“23331, in the same application.
