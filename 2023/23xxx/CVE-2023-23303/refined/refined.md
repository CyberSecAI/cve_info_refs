The provided content is related to CVE-2023-23303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `enableEncryption` method in the `Toybox.Ant.GenericChannel` class copies the `encryptionKey` and `userInfoString` parameters from an `Ant.CryptoConfig` object to static buffers without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- The `tvm_copy_array_to_buffer` function copies array data into fixed-size buffers without validating the size of the source array.
- The `Ant.CryptoConfig` class has a default limit of 16 bytes for `encryptionKey` and `userInfoString`, but this limit can be bypassed through inheritance and redefinition of attributes after initialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Device crash and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing an `Ant.CryptoConfig` object with `encryptionKey` and/or `userInfoString` arrays larger than 16 bytes to the `enableEncryption` method, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and execute custom Connect IQ applications on a Garmin device.
- Ability to redefine class attributes in Monkey C.
