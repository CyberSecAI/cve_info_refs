Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23305:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow when calculating buffer size for font data within the Garmin firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The firmware calculates the buffer size for font data based on values read from the font resource header (`font_data_size` and `font_glyph_count`). An integer overflow can occur in this calculation, resulting in a smaller-than-needed buffer being allocated.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** After the undersized buffer is allocated, the firmware copies font data into it, leading to out-of-bounds writes, which can cause a crash. This occurs in the loop where glyph data is read from the font resource and written to the allocated buffer.
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet**: The vulnerability is located in the `_tvm_app_load_resource` function where `size_glyph_table_buffer` is calculated, and the subsequent copying of glyph data into the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash due to the out-of-bounds write, which can make the device unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Font Resource:** An attacker crafts a malicious font resource (within a `PRG` application) with specific header values that trigger the integer overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create or modify a PRG application:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Garmin `PRG` application in order to embed the malicious font resource. This could involve having access to a development environment or the ability to modify existing `PRG` files.
*   **Ability to load the application on the device:** The attacker needs to be able to load the crafted `PRG` application onto a vulnerable Garmin device to trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Understanding of the font resource format:** The attacker must understand the font resource structure and how to manipulate header values to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs due to the following formula used to calculate the buffer size:

`size_glyph_table_buffer = (font_data_size & 0xffff) + (int)font_glyph_count * 4 + 0x34;`

By providing a large value for `font_glyph_count` (e.g., `0x4000001A`) and a small value for `font_data_size` (e.g., `0x108`), the result of the calculation overflows, leading to a smaller buffer allocation. The subsequent data copy then results in an out-of-bounds write.

The content provides a specific example to trigger the vulnerability using `glyph count: 0x4000001A` and `font data size: 0x108`. It also shows the code location where the vulnerability exists and how the buffer calculation and memory copy are performed.

**Additional Information:** The vulnerability affects both non-unicode and unicode fonts.
