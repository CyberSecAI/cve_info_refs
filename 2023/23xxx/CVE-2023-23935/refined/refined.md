Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-23935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `Topic#pm_topic_count` was displaying a count of all personal messages tagged with a specific tag, regardless of whether the user had access to those messages. This allowed unauthorized users to infer the existence of new personal messages associated with a tag, even if they couldn't view the message content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of information about the existence of personal messages. Even if the content of a PM was protected, the fact that a PM was created with a certain tag could be inferred via the `pm_topic_count`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Minor Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially monitor specific tags to determine when new personal messages are created, which could reveal sensitive information. This is considered a minor leak.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network by querying the API for tag information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges, meaning any user of the platform could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to make a request to the server. This attack requires no specific user interaction other than loading a page.
- **Knowledge of Tags:** The attacker needs knowledge of tags that are used in personal messages.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Mitigation:** The fix hides the `pm_topic_count` by default. A new site setting (`display_personal_messages_tag_counts`) was introduced to allow admins to revert to the old behavior.
- **Affected Versions:** Discourse versions `stable <= 3.0.1`, `beta <= 3.1.0.beta2`, and `tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta2` are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** Versions `stable > 3.0.1`, `beta > 3.1.0.beta2`, and `tests-passed > 3.1.0.beta2` include the fix.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 3.5, rated as low severity. The vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
