The provided content relates to CVE-2023-23551.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Control By Web X-600M devices run Lua scripts and are vulnerable to code injection due to improper control of code generation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - CWE-94

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected devices. This could result in a complete compromise of the device, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device. The CVSS vector string indicates that the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. However, the description suggests that this could be achieved via a code injection attack, potentially through an authenticated interface. The CVSS vector also indicates that the vulnerability has low complexity (AC:L), no user interaction is needed (UI:N), and the scope is changed (S:C) which mean that the vulnerability in one component impacts other component.
