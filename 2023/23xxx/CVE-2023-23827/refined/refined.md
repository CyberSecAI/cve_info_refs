**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** WordPress Google Maps v3 Shortcode Plugin

**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.2.1

**Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, which allows malicious actors to inject scripts.

**Weaknesses:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before outputting it on the webpage. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Impact:**
*   A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts into the website.
*   Injected scripts can be used for redirects, displaying advertisements, or executing other arbitrary HTML/JavaScript payloads.
*   This allows for various attacks, including phishing, malware distribution, and session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts via the plugin's settings or functionalities.
*   The injected scripts are executed when a user visits the page with the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin, either directly through plugin functionality, or via other attack vectors.
*   The attacker can be a low privileged user, with a privilege of contributor.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited. However, it's still a security risk, particularly if a website has many low-severity vulnerabilities.
*   There is no official fix available at the time of the report.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   The CVSS score is 6.5, which is considered moderate.
