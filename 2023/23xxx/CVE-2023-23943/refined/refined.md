Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Nextcloud Mail app's SMTP, IMAP, and Sieve host fields did not properly validate or restrict input, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs.

**Weakness:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), specifically a blind SSRF vulnerability. The application does not sanitize or validate the input in the SMTP, IMAP, and Sieve host fields.

**Impact:** An attacker could use these fields to scan internal services and servers within the local network of the Nextcloud server. This could expose sensitive information about internal infrastructure or potentially lead to further exploitation of other internal services.

**Attack Vector:** Network. An attacker with access to the Nextcloud Mail app's settings can input malicious URLs into the host fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs a low-privilege account to access and modify mail app settings within the Nextcloud instance. The attacker must be able to configure mail settings which include the server host fields. The attacker must also have network access to the Nextcloud server instance. The user is also required to interact with the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.15.0 and 2.2.2 of the Nextcloud Mail app.
- The fix involved borrowing code from `nextcloud/server#34852` to validate remote hosts.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 3.5.
- This vulnerability is related to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
