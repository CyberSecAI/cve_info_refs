# Jws ignores signature checks

Critical

[ulrikstrid](/ulrikstrid)
published
GHSA-7jj9-6qwv-wpm7
Jan 31, 2023

## Package

jose
(OCaml)

## Affected versions

<0.8.2

## Patched versions

0.8.2

## Description

### Impact

`Jose.Jws.validate` does not check HS256 signatures. This allows tampering of JWS header and payload data if the service does not perform additional checks.

Such tampering could expose applications using reason-jose to authorisation bypass.

Applications relying on JWS claims assertion to enforce security boundaries may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.

### Patches

0.8.2

### Workarounds

If you can avoid using symmetric keys and instead use asymmetric keys that should be working as intended already.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-23928

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
