- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `startDate` parameter in the `/php_action/getOrderReport.php` file before it's used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, modify data, or even potentially compromise the server if the database user has sufficient privileges. The provided payload allows extraction of table names.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/php_action/getOrderReport.php` endpoint, with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `startDate` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be in a remote position (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
