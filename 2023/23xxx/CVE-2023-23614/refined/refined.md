- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Remember me for 7 days" functionality uses the admin's password hash directly as the cookie value, instead of using a secure, randomly generated token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -   Improper session handling: Using the password hash as the session identifier.
    -   Information leakage: Exposing the password hash over the network and storing it in the browser.
    -   Use of password hash for authentication: Bypassing password-based authentication by directly using the hash.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -   An attacker can bypass the password requirement by setting the cookie to the admin password hash.
    -   An attacker can use a leaked or compromised cookie indefinitely as long as the password is not changed.
    -   An attacker with access to the password hash (e.g., via path traversal) can directly log in as admin by using the hash as the cookie value.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -   Network sniffing to obtain the password hash when the user logs in with "Remember me" functionality enabled.
    -   Compromise of browser storage where the cookie is stored.
    -   Exploitation of other vulnerabilities (e.g., path traversal) to obtain the admin password hash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -   Ability to sniff network traffic (for initial cookie capture) or access a compromised user's browser.
    -   Ability to obtain the admin password hash via other vulnerabilities.
    -   Ability to set the `persistentlogin` cookie value in the browser (e.g. using browser developer tools or by injecting javascript).
