- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Users with limited data privileges were able to add themselves to dashboard subscriptions created by users with higher privileges. This allowed them to receive emails containing data they shouldn't normally have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient access control mechanism that allows users to modify dashboard subscriptions created by others, leading to unauthorized data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability enables unauthorized access to data through email subscriptions. This can lead to a breach of confidentiality where users with lower privileges can view sensitive information that was not intended for them.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, utilizing the existing subscription functionality of Metabase.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user account with limited privileges on the Metabase platform, and the ability to view a dashboard and add themself to a subscription created by another user with higher privileges. User interaction is required to add themselves to a subscription.
