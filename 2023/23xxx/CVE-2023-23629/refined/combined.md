# Users can view data they don't have privileges to view by adding themselves to dashboard subscriptions created by users with more data privileges

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<x43.7.1, <x.44.6.1, <x45.2.1

## Patched versions

0.43.7.1, 1.43.7.1, 0.44.6.1, 1.44.6.1, 0.45.2.1, 1.45.2.1

## Description

### Impact

As intended, recipients of dashboards subscriptions can view the data as seen by the creator of that subscription. What this means is that if a person in a group with more access to data creates a dashboard subscription, and adds a person with fewer data privileges, the data delivered to that person's inbox, and all recipients of that subscription, would be the same: the charts shown in the email would abide by the privileges of the user who created the subscription.

The problem was that users with fewer privileges who could view a dashboard were able to add *themselves* to a dashboard subscription created by someone with additional data privileges, and thus get access to more data via email.

### Patches

This issue will be patched in `0.43.7.1`, `1.43.7.1`, `0.44.6.1`, `1.44.6.1`, `0.45.2.1`, `1.45.2.1`. In the upgraded version of Metabase, people can only edit dashboard subscriptions that they create. Admins can still edit any dashboard subscription.

### Workarounds

On Metabase instances running Enterprise Edition, admins can disable the "Subscriptions and Alerts" permission for groups that have restricted data permissions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
