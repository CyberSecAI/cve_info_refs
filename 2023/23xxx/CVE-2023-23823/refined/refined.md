Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the "Enhanced Text Widget" WordPress plugin. This missing check allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core vulnerability is a broken access control issue, stemming from inadequate checks on user privileges before allowing access to certain functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited, however, the specific impact varies on a case by case basis depending on the function that can be exploited. An unauthenticated user could potentially perform actions they shouldn't be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or other actions within the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper access control checks within the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires no prior authentication. An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
