- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The firmware update process uses a CRC32 checksum for integrity verification, which is cryptographically weak and easily manipulated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of CRC32 for firmware integrity check.
    - Lack of cryptographic signing or more robust checksum algorithm.
    - Susceptibility to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks during firmware updates.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Introduction of backdoors or malware into the device.
    - Denial of service (DoS) by flashing a corrupt or malicious firmware.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack during firmware update process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Privileged network position (e.g., via ARP spoofing or DNS spoofing) to intercept and modify firmware updates.
    - Ability to craft a malicious firmware image with the same CRC32 value as the original firmware.
