Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-23447:

**Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

**Root Cause:** The SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption due to the webserver allowing multiple open file requests via the REST interface.

**Affected Products:**
*   SICK FTMG-ESD15AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1100214)
*   SICK FTMG-ESD20AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1100215)
*   SICK FTMG-ESD25AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1100216)
*   SICK FTMG-ESN40SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1122524)
*    SICK FTMG-ESN50SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1122526)
*    SICK FTMG-ESR40SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1120114)
*   SICK FTMG-ESR50SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR all versions with Firmware < v2.x (Part Number: 1120116)

**Weaknesses:**
*   **CWE-400:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper limits on the number of file requests that the web server can handle, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote unauthenticated attacker can influence the availability of the web server. By sending a high number of open file requests via the REST interface, the attacker can cause resource exhaustion, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **REST Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via the REST interface of the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vendor has released a new major firmware version (v3.0.0.131) to address this vulnerability.
*   A temporary mitigation is to ensure good network segmentation and security practices in place.
