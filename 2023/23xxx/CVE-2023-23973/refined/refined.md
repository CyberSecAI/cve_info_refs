- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Contact Us Page - Contact people LITE plugin for WordPress, in versions 3.7.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact would vary based on the plugin's functionality and the actions an attacker could trigger.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via CSRF, which involves tricking an authenticated user into clicking a link or visiting a website that contains malicious code to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests that target a vulnerable instance of the plugin, and these requests must be triggered by an authenticated user. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
