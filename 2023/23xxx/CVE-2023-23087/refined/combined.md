| I tested your code with Xcode, and found an error:  ``` Initializing 'JsonValue' with an expression of incompatible type 'JsonValue *'; dereference with * ```  Check the API of JsonValue:  ``` JsonValue* (*Parse) (const char* jsonString);  ```  So I changed the code to:  ``` JsonValue* value = AJson->Parse(jstr);  ```  But got a runtime error:  ``` Invalid json value type, error char = :  ```  Now the problem is that the string is not a valid json format：  ``` char* jstr = ":#@$^^&^(";  ``` |
