Here's what's new in Serv-U File Server 15.4.

**Learn more**

* Get information about the [latest hotfixes](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Serv-U-Hotfixes).
* See the Serv-U [system requirements](../system_requirements/serv-u_15-4_system_requirements.htm).
* For information about working with Serv-U, see the [Serv-U Administrator Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/archive/pdf/servu/Serv-U_File_Server_Administrator_Guide_15-4.pdf).
## New features and improvements in Serv-U

### Multifactor authentication

Multifactor authentication can be used to provide an additional layer of security. When multifactor authentication is set up, users are prompted to enter a six-digit code sent by a third-party multifactor authentication app, in addition to their user name and password. Serv-U supports a variety of multifactor authentication apps.

Multifactor authentication is disabled by default. Serv-U administrators can choose to enable it (users can enter a code but are not required to) or enforce it (users must enter a code to log in). Multifactor authentication can be configured at the [global](../servu-mfa-global.htm), [domain](../servu-mfa-domain.htm), [group](../servu-mfa-group.htm), or [user](../servu-mfa-user.htm) level.

### Support for Secure LDAP in a Linux installation

When Serv-U is installed on a Linux server, secure LDAP (LDAPS) is now supported. LDAPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt and authenticate the data exchanged between Serv-U and the LDAP server. All interactions are performed through a secure channel, which prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting or modifying the data.

### Other improvements

* In the new web client, you can move files and folders by dragging and dropping them.
* SHA2 ciphers are supported.
* Serv-U 15.4 includes security improvements.
