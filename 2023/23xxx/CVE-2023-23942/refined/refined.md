Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when displayed within the Nextcloud Desktop client's UI. Specifically, the client was not properly sanitizing the text displayed in labels, allowing for the rendering of basic HTML elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Self-Reflected HTML Injection:** The core vulnerability is a self-reflected HTML injection. This means the application renders HTML elements present in the data it displays back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is considered "Low". Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to inject basic HTML elements such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, and header tags into the desktop client's UI. This could potentially be used to:
    *   Display misleading information within the client's UI.
    *   Potentially make the UI look odd or broken

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is "Local", meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable client is running.
*   The attacker needs to inject the malicious HTML code in the data that is displayed by the client.
*   User interaction is "Required", since the client needs to process and display the malicious HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the data displayed by the Nextcloud Desktop Client to inject HTML code that gets interpreted by the client UI.
*   The attacker also requires low privileges on the system running the client.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)).
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.6.3 of the Nextcloud Desktop client. The fix involved replacing all `Label` and `Text` components in the QML code with a new `EnforcedPlainTextLabel` component, which prevents the rendering of HTML.
