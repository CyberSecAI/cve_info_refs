# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1697

## Milesight UR32L uhttpd login buffer overflow vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-23902

##### SUMMARY

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the uhttpd login functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted network request can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The router provides an administrative web page to manage its various settings. This web page requires the client to login. The password is AES encrypted and then Base64 encoded before being sent to the server. The `uhttpd`’s `decrypt_string` function is the one responsible for decrypting the received AES-encrypted, Base64-encoded password in the login process. Following the `decrypt_string` function:

```
void decrypt_string(char *b64_encrypted_password,char *decrypted_password,size_t size_decrypted_password)

{
  [...]
  uchar stack_decrypted_string [72];

  [... init the AES_key variable]
  [... init the AES_IV variable]
  [... calculate the __size variable value ...]
  base64_decoded_string_start = (uchar *)malloc(__size);
  [...]
  memset(base64_decoded_string_start,0,__size);
  processed_len = 0;
  base64_decode_string_cursor = base64_decoded_string_start;
  do {
    // this check allow to base64 decode the string before decrypting it
    if ((password_len_ - padding) <= processed_len) {
      *base64_decode_string_cursor = '\0';
      ctx = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new();
      [... check error ...]
      cipher_type = EVP_aes_128_cbc();
      processed_len = EVP_DecryptInit_ex(ctx,cipher_type,(ENGINE *)0x0,AES_key,AES_IV);
      [... check error ...]
      processed_len =
           EVP_DecryptUpdate(ctx,stack_decrypted_string,&output_len,base64_decoded_string_start,
                             (int)(base64_decode_string_cursor +
                                  (-1 - (int)base64_decoded_string_start)));                             [1]
      [... check error ...]
      processed_len = output_len;
      iVar3 = EVP_DecryptFinal_ex(ctx,stack_decrypted_string + output_len,&output_len);
      [... check error ...]
      processed_len = processed_len + output_len;
      EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(ctx);
      stack_decrypted_string[processed_len] = '\0';
      EVP_cleanup();
      ERR_free_strings();
      free(base64_decoded_string_start);
      strncpy(decrypted_password,(char *)stack_decrypted_string,size_decrypted_password);                [2]
      return;
    }
    [...]
    [... base64 decode ...]                                                                              [3]
  } while( true );
}

```

This function has three parameters: the `b64_encrypted_password` parameter is the AES-encrypted and Base64-encoded password string that will be Base64 decoded and then AES decrypted; `decrypted_password` is the destination buffer where the decoded and decrypted password will be copied; `size_decrypted_password` is the size of the `decrypted_password` buffer.

At `[3]` the `b64_encrypted_password` string is Base64 decoded and then, at `[1]`, the decoded value is AES decrypted into `stack_decrypted_string`, a 72-byte long stack buffer. Eventually, at `[2]`, `size_decrypted_password` bytes will be copied from the `stack_decrypted_string` buffer into the `decrypted_password` buffer.

In the `decrypted_password` only `size_decrypted_password` bytes will be copied, which will prevent any type of buffer overflow in the `decrypted_password` buffer.
At `[1]` the `OpenSSL`’s `EVP_DecryptUpdate` function will perform the decryption of the Base64 decoded user-controlled data into the `stack_decrypted_string` stack buffer. Because the `stack_decrypted_string` stack buffer is fixed in size and the decrypted string, provided by a user, can be greater in length than the stack buffer, this can lead to a buffer overflow in the `stack_decrypted_string` buffer.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Since the maintainer of this software did not release a patch during the 90 day window specified in our policy, we have now decided to release the information regarding this vulnerability, to make users of the software aware of this problem.
