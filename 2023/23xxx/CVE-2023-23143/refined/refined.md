{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to an incorrect check on `pps_id` in `avc_parse_slice` and `svc_parse_slice` functions within `src/media_tools/av_parsers.c`. The vulnerability occurs when the `pps_id` value is equal to 255, leading to an out-of-bounds access when indexing the `avc->pps` array.  The original check `pps_id > 255` was ineffective in preventing this, as it allowed `pps_id` to equal 255.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to denial of service due to a crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution, depending on the context.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted media file that includes a crafted slice header where the `pps_id` is set to 255.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide a malicious media file to be processed by GPAC that includes the crafted slice headers."
