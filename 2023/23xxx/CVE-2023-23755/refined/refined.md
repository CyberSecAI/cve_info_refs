{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The lack of rate limiting on the multi-factor authentication (MFA) screen.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Absence of rate limiting which allows for brute-force attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can perform brute-force attacks against MFA methods, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks attempting multiple MFA login attempts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the login page with MFA enabled and make repeated login attempts."
