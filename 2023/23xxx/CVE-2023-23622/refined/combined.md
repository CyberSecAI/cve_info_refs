# Presence of read restricted topics may be leaked if tagged with a tag that is visible to all users

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-2wvr-4x7w-v795
Mar 17, 2023

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 3.0.0; beta <= 3.1.0.beta1; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta1

## Patched versions

stable > 3.0.0; beta > 3.1.0.beta1; tests-passed > 3.1.0.beta1

## Description

### Impact

Currently, the count of topics displayed for a tag is a count of all regular topics regardless of whether the topic is in a read restricted category or not. As a result, any users can technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new topic is created in a category which the user does not have excess to.

### Patches

In the patched versions, the count of topics displayed for a tag defaults to only counting regular topics which are not in read restricted categories. Staff users will continue to see a count of all topics regardless of the topic's category read restrictions.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
