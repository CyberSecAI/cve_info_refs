  "CVE-2023-23925": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in the `switcher-client` npm package, where unsanitized input is used to construct regular expressions within the Strategy match operation (EXIST). This can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the application uses user-controlled input to build a regular expression without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to craft input that can cause the regular expression engine to perform excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU usage and denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Unsanitized input used to build regular expressions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
         "CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful ReDoS attack can lead to denial of service, making the application unresponsive or unavailable due to high resource consumption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send specially crafted input to a vulnerable endpoint.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They can send a crafted request containing a malicious string designed to trigger exponential backtracking in the regex engine."
