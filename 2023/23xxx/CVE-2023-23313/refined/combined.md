### Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability via security bypass in Tassos Marino's Convert Forms extension - CVE-2024-40744

Horizon Security has identified an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability involving the Convert Forms extension by Tassos Marinos, mainly used by web applications developed with well-known frameworks such as Joomla. This insecure behavior makes it possible to upload any type of file to the web server, which could allow the distribution of malicious files to the form’s recipients or, depending on the server’s configuration, the potential execution of malicious code on the server hosting the web application.

### **Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (CVE-2023-23313)**

##### Released Date: 2023-03-02

---

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the hotspot web portal and user management login page on Draytek Routers (CVE-2023-23313) has been discovered.

It is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to inject and store arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser by using the vulnerable CGI script. Since the injected code is stored permanently, every user visiting the web
application will trigger the stored malicious payload. DrayTek will release new firmwares with security updates for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability as follows.
