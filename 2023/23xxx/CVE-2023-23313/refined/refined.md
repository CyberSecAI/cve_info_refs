Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2023-23313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the hotspot web portal and user management login page on DrayTek routers. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code via vulnerable CGI scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and permanently stored within the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user visits the vulnerable web page, the stored malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Theft of sensitive information
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious code by exploiting vulnerable CGI scripts in the router's web interface.
- The injected code is stored, meaning the attack doesn't require the attacker to be constantly present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable interface of the DrayTek router. It is mentioned that an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability, implying the vulnerable interface is exposed to the network.
