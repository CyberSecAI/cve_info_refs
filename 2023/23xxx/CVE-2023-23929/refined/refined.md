Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that refresh tokens in `vantage6` did not have an expiration time, making them valid indefinitely. This deviates from secure practices where refresh tokens should have a limited lifespan.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Refresh Token Validity:** The primary weakness is that refresh tokens do not expire, which allows an attacker to potentially maintain access to the system indefinitely, even if the initial access token is compromised or has expired.
- **CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration):** This is a general weakness where the application does not properly manage session expiration leading to vulnerabilities related to session management and token validity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Persistent Access:** An attacker who obtains a refresh token could use it to obtain new access tokens indefinitely, allowing them to maintain access to the system even after the initial access token expires or is revoked.
- **Increased Risk of Unauthorized Actions:** The persistent access provided by an unexpiring refresh token could enable an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Refresh Token Theft:** If an attacker gains access to a refresh token (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack, compromised client, etc.), they could then use the token indefinitely.
- **Compromised Client:** If a user's client application or device is compromised, the attacker could potentially gain access to refresh tokens stored on that client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to a valid refresh token:** An attacker needs to somehow obtain a valid refresh token. This could be achieved through various methods, including intercepting network traffic, compromising the client application, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to obtain credentials.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involved implementing a configurable expiration time for refresh tokens, as well as ensuring that a new refresh token is returned when a token is refreshed. The fix was implemented in version `3.8.0`.
- The vulnerability was classified as "moderate" severity.
- The affected versions are those prior to `3.8.0`.
