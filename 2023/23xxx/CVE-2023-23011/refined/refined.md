Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-23011:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before rendering it in HTML. Specifically, the application takes user input from HTTP GET/POST parameters and directly outputs it to the HTML without any form of escaping, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present. The vulnerabilities arise when user-controlled data is directly embedded into HTML without proper sanitization.

*   **Vulnerability 1:**
    *   **Location:** `InvoicePlane-development\application\modules\products\controllers\Ajax.php` and `InvoicePlane-development\application\modules\products\views\modal_product_lookups.php`
    *   The `filter_product` parameter received via a GET request is directly output to the HTML in the `modal_product_lookups.php` view.
*  **Vulnerability 2:**
    *   **Location:** `InvoicePlane-development\application\modules\invoices\controllers\Ajax.php` and `InvoicePlane-development\application\modules\invoices\views\modal_create_recurring.php`
    *   The `invoice_id` parameter received via a POST request is directly output to the HTML in the `modal_create_recurring.php` view.
*   **Vulnerabilities 3-9:**
    *   **Location:**  Similar vulnerabilities exist with parameters like `invoice_id` and `quote_id` in other modal views. Specifically:
        *   `invoice_id` in `modal_create_recurring.php`
        *   `invoice_id` in `modal_create_credit.php`
        *   `quote_id` in `modal_copy_quote.php`
        *   `invoice_id` in `modal_copy_invoice.php`
        *   `quote_id` in `modal_change_client.php`
        *   `payment_cf_exist` in `modal_add_payment.php`
        *   `quote_id` within the `change_client` function's JSON response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser. This could result in:

*   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies or session tokens.
*   Data theft: Accessing sensitive information within the application.
*   Malware distribution: Redirecting the user to malicious sites or downloading malware.
*   Defacement: Altering the appearance of the website.
*   Phishing attacks: Redirecting the user to fake login pages.
*   Arbitrary actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending crafted HTTP GET/POST requests with malicious script in the vulnerable parameters.
*   For example, to exploit vulnerability 1, an attacker would craft a GET request to `products/modal_product_lookups` with a malicious payload in the `filter_product` parameter:  `https://example.com/index.php/products/modal_product_lookups?filter_product=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This typically means they would need network access to the application's web server and be able to construct and send requests to the relevant URLs.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated (depending on the specific endpoint) for some of the injection points. However, some injection points might require an authenticated user.
*   The attacker needs some understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and HTTP to craft the payloads.
