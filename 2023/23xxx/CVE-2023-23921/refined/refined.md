Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23921:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of `returnurl` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions within the application's context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the `returnurl` parameter within the application's URL. An attacker could craft a malicious link containing a payload within the `returnurl` parameter. When a user clicks on this link, the malicious script is reflected back to the user's browser, executing the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing a XSS payload within the `returnurl` parameter, then get a victim to click the link.

**Additional Details:**
