- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Quick Event Manager plugin for WordPress versions <= 9.7.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions on the website by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, leading to unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
