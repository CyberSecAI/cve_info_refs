#### Success Stories

*“Thanks to the WALLIX PAM, the product has shown that it is perfectly adapted to our perimeter both in terms of scale and simplicity. To summarize, WALLIX offers the best value for our requirements”*

![](https://www.wallix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MICHELIN_Logo-180x180.png)**Thomas Lefaure**ISS Architect#–Michelin Group

*“Ever since we started working with WALLIX IAG solution, I don’t think we have truly reduced the duration of review campaigns. However, within the same timeframe, we transitioned from reviewing a single scope (Mainframe) to reviewing over 150 applications, for both Administrative and Distributor populations.”*

Sudo Privilege Escalation affecting WALLIX Products – CVE-2021-3156

###### SUMMARY

The Qualys Research Team has discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in sudo (CVE-2021-3156), any local unprivileged user can gain root privileges on a vulnerable host using a default sudo configuration by exploiting this vulnerability.

sudo can only be exploited locally. This means that either :

* The user is connected on the WALLIX Bastion, through the wabadmin account, on the administration interface. This user can then exploit sudo to become root and bypass all securities of WALLIX Bastion
* A Remote Code Exploitation (RCE) vulnerability exists in another piece of WALLIX software or third party, that will provides a local shell. After successfully exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker will be able to exploit sudo to become root. To WALLIX knowledge, an up-to-date Bastion does not have such vulnerability

###### Affected Products

* All versions prior to WALLIX Bastion 8.0.6 (included)
* All versions 8.1 and 8.2

###### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this vulnerability

###### Fixed Software

This vulnerability is fixed from the WALLIX Bastion 8.0.7 on, and 7.0.14  on.

* A Fix Patch is available for version 8.0.6 and before (it applies for 8.1 and 8.2 versions)
* A Fix patch is available for version 7.0.13 and before
