{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `PackLinuxElf64::invert_pt_dynamic` function within `p_lx_elf.cpp`. It occurs when processing a crafted ELF file that results in out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation.",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted input files processed by UPX.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted ELF file to the UPX tool."
