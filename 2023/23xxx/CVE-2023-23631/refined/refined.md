{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check on the fanout parameter in HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie) directory nodes. A malformed HAMT directory with a bogus fanout parameter can lead to panics and virtual memory leaks during decoding.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Uncontrolled resource allocation: The code does not properly validate the fanout parameter, allowing an attacker to specify a very large value that could lead to excessive memory allocation.",
    "Denial of Service (DoS): By providing a malformed HAMT directory, an attacker can trigger panics and memory leaks, leading to a denial of service."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger panics and virtual memory leaks, causing a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves reading malformed HAMT sharded directories with a bogus fanout parameter. This can be achieved by providing crafted input that is processed by the vulnerable code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by the vulnerable HAMT decoding logic. This could be untrusted user input, or data from a compromised source."
