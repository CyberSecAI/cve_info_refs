Package        : nodejs
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-23920
Debian Bug     : 1031834

An untrusted search path vulnerability was discovered in Node.js, which
could result in unexpected searching or loading ICU data when running
with elevated privileges.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your nodejs packages.

For the detailed security status of nodejs please refer to
its security tracker page at:

Thursday February 16 2023 Security Releases
# [*(Update 16-February-2023)* Security releases available](#update-16-february-2023-security-releases-available)

Updates are now available for the v19.x, v18.x, v16.x, and v14.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## [OpenSSL Security updates](#openssl-security-updates)

This security release includes OpenSSL security updates as outlined in the recent
[OpenSSL security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).

Impacts:

* All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## [Node.js Permissions policies can be bypassed via process.mainModule (High) ([CVE-2023-23918](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23918))](#nodejs-permissions-policies-can-be-bypassed-via-processmainmodule-high-cve-2023-23918)

It was possible to bypass [Permissions](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html) and access non authorized modules by using process.mainModule.require(). This only affects users who had enabled the experimental permissions option with `--experimental-policy`.

Thank you, to [@goums](https://github.com/goums) for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## [Node.js OpenSSL error handling issues in nodejs crypto library (Medium) ([CVE-2023-23919](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23919))](#nodejs-openssl-error-handling-issues-in-nodejs-crypto-library-medium-cve-2023-23919)

In some cases Node.js did does not clear the OpenSSL error stack after operations that may set it. This may lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations that happen to be on the same thread. This in turn could be used to cause a denial of service.

Thank you, to Morgan Jones and Ryan Dorrity from Viasat Secure Mobile for reporting and discovering this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

* Versions of < 19.2.0 and lower of the 19.x release line and all versions of the 18.x, and 16.x release lines.

## [Fetch API in Node.js did not protect against CRLF injection in host headers (Medium) ([CVE-2023-23936](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23936))](#fetch-api-in-nodejs-did-not-protect-against-crlf-injection-in-host-headers-medium-cve-2023-23936)

The [fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) in Node.js did not prevent
CRLF injection in the 'host' header potentially allowing attacks such as HTTP response splitting
and HTTP header injection.

Thank you, to Zhipeng Zhang ([@timon8](https://hackerone.com/timon8)) for reporting this vulnerability and thank you Robert Nagy for fixing it.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 19.x, 18.x and 16.x release lines.

## [Regular Expression Denial of Service in Headers in Node.js fetch API(Low) ([CVE-2023-24807](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24807))](#regular-expression-denial-of-service-in-headers-in-nodejs-fetch-apilow-cve-2023-24807)

The Headers.set() and Headers.append() methods in the
[fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) in Node.js were vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.

Thank you, to Carter Snook for reporting this vulnerability and thank you Rich Trott for fixing it.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, and 16.x release lines.

## [Node.js insecure loading of ICU data through ICU\_DATA environment variable (Low) ([CVE-2023-23920](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23920))](#nodejs-insecure-loading-of-icu-data-through-icu_data-environment-variable-low-cve-2023-23920)

Node.js would search and potentially load ICU data when running with elevated priviledges. Node.js
was modified to build with `ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE` to avoid this.

Thank you, to Ben Noordhuis for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## [npm update for Node.js 14](#npm-update-for-nodejs-14)

This security release also includes an npm update for Node.js 14 to address a number
of CVEs which either do not affect Node.js or are low severity in the context of Node.js. You
can get more details for the individual CVEs in
[nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments).

Impacts:

* All versions 14.x release lines.

## [Downloads and release details](#downloads-and-release-details)

Thanks to Rafael Gonzaga and Richard Lau for their work on the releases.

* [Node.js v14.21.3 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v14.21.3/)
* [Node.js v16.19.1 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v16.19.1/)
* [Node.js v18.14.1 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v18.14.1/)
* [Node.js v19.6.1 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v19.6.1/)

## [*(Update 14-February-2023)* 2 Day delay in security releases](#update-14-february-2023-2-day-delay-in-security-releases)

The Node.js project is delaying the planned security releases until Thursday
February 16 2023 due to the need for additional testing and validation.

## [*(Update 7-February-2023)* Summary](#update-7-february-2023-summary)

The Node.js project will release new versions of the 14.x, 16.x, 18.x and 19.x
releases lines on or shortly after, Tuesday February 14 2023 in order to address:

* 2 low severity issues.
* 2 medium severity issues.
* 1 high severity issues.
* OpenSSL security updates for which the highest vulnerability severity is high. You
  can read more about this update in the
  [OpenSSL security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).

## [Impact](#impact)

The 19.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to 2 low severity issues, 2 medium severity issues and 1 high severity issue and the OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

The 18.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to 2 low severity issues, 2 medium severity issues and 1 high severity issue and the OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

The 16.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to 2 low severity issues, 2 medium severity issues, and 1 high severity issue and the OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

The 14.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to 1 low severity issue, and 1 high severity issue and the OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

## [Release timing](#release-timing)

Releases will be available on, or shortly after, Tuesday February 14 2023.

Package        : nodejs
Version        : 10.24.0~dfsg-1~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-43548 CVE-2023-23920
Debian Bug     : 1023518 1031834

Vulnerabilities have been found in Node.js, which could result in DNS
rebinding or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2022-43548

    The Node.js rebinding protector for `--inspect` still allows invalid
    IP addresses, specifically in octal format, which browsers such as
    Firefox attempt to resolve via DNS.  When combined with an active
    `--inspect` session, such as when using VSCode, an attacker can
    perform DNS rebinding and execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-23920

    Ben Noordhuis reported that Node.js would search and potentially
    load ICU data when running with elevated privileges.  Node.js now
    builds with `ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE` to avoid this.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
10.24.0~dfsg-1~deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nodejs packages.
