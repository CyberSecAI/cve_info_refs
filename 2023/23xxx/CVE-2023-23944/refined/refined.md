Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23944:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud Mail app was temporarily storing user passwords in cleartext in the database during the OAuth2 setup procedure. This occurred because the password field was not being cleared when it should have been (when using XOAUTH2), leading to the temporary storage of the plaintext password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the temporary storage of passwords in a readable format within the database, rather than using proper encryption or token-based authentication. This violates fundamental security practices for handling sensitive user credentials.
- **Incorrect Password Handling:** The vulnerability arises from incorrect conditional logic in the password storage mechanism. Passwords should only be stored for password authentication methods, not for OAuth2 flows, where access tokens should be used instead.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious actor who gains access to the database during the OAuth2 setup process could obtain user passwords in cleartext. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to user email accounts and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Database Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who has access to the Nextcloud database during the vulnerable window when an OAuth2 account setup is being performed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker must have high-level privileges to access the Nextcloud database.
- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to access the database during the short timeframe when an OAuth2 account is being configured when the password is temporarily stored in cleartext.
- **Local Attack Vector**: The attacker must be on the local network or system to access the database.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.2 of the Nextcloud Mail app.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The issue was discovered and fixed by ChristophWurst.
