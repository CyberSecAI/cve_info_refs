Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Selfwealth iOS mobile application (version 3.3.1) contains hardcoded API keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hardcoded API keys:** The application directly embeds API keys within its code. This makes the keys easily accessible to anyone who can inspect the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized API access:** An attacker who extracts the hardcoded API keys can use them to make requests to the application's backend API.
- **Potential financial cost:**  The API usage associated with these keys has a cost of between $5 and $32 per 1000 requests, which could result in significant financial burden for the legitimate application owner.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Static Analysis:** The API keys can be discovered by decompiling or reverse engineering the iOS application binary.
- **Passive surveillance:** If the application transmits the keys within network traffic without proper security they could be captured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to obtain the application:** The attacker must be able to download the vulnerable iOS application.
- **Reverse engineering skills:** Basic reverse engineering skills are required to extract the API keys from the application binary.
