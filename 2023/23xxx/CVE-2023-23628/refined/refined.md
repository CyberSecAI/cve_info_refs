- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A sandboxed user could view the list of recipients for a dashboard subscription, even if those recipients were other users, violating the principle that sandboxed users should not be able to view data about other Metabase users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control for dashboard subscription settings, leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A sandboxed user can view the list of recipients for a dashboard subscription, which may reveal information about other users, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized data access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker needs to have a sandboxed user account on the vulnerable Metabase instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a sandboxed user account and be able to access the Metabase application through the network. User interaction is required to view the dashboard subscription settings.
