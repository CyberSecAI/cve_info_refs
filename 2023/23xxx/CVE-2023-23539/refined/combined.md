# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1659

## Apple DCERPC presentation result list out of bounds memory access

##### July 13, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-23539

##### SUMMARY

An out of bounds memory access vulnerability exists in the processing of packets containing presentation result lists in DCERPC library as used in Apple macOS 12.6.1. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to out of bounds memory access which can lead to denial of service. A remote attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability. A local attacker can write to a local socket to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Apple macOS 12.6.1

##### PRODUCT URLS

macOS - <https://apple.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.9 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-823 - Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset

##### DETAILS

DCERPC is a remote procedure call protocol that is the basis for RPC functionality on Windows. DCERPC framework on macOS implements this protocol and enables interoperability of Windows network services on macOS. For example, it is used on top of SMB, through which support for Active Directory is implemented. DCERPC framework is employed by the `rpcsvchost` binary, which opens a number of UNIX sockets that expose different RPC functionality.

A client can send a plethora of different packet types (`RPC_C_CN_PKT_REQUEST`, `RPC_C_CN_PKT_BIND`, etc.). For each packet type, the library parses the data received from the network and calculates different pointers for relevant structures inside the packet data.

```
#define RPC_CN_PKT_SIZEOF_BIND_ACK_HDR (RPC_CN_PKT_SIZEOF_COMMON_HDR + 2 + 2 + 4)
...
case RPC_C_CN_PKT_BIND_ACK:
case RPC_C_CN_PKT_ALTER_CONTEXT_RESP:
	   ...
        secadrp = (rpc_cn_port_any_t *)
            ((unsigned8 *)(pkt_p) + RPC_CN_PKT_SIZEOF_BIND_ACK_HDR);          [1]
        presp = unpack_port_any (secadrp, drepp, end_of_pkt, &st);            [2]

```

In the case of `RPC_C_CN_PKT_BIND_ACK` and `RPC_C_CN_PKT_ALTER_CONTEXT_RESP`, we see the code at [1] calculating `secadrp` as a pointer inside network-received data that reside in `pkt_p`. Then the code proceeds to call `unpack_port_any()` at [2] returning the `presp` pointer.

```
INTERNAL rpc_cn_pres_result_list_p_t unpack_port_any
(
    rpc_cn_port_any_t       *port_any_p,
    unsigned8               *drepp,
    unsigned8               *end_of_pkt,
    unsigned32              *st
)
{
	 union
    {                                            /* a "proper" union to shut up lint */
		 unsigned8 *string;                      /* a string pointer */
		 rpc_cn_pres_result_list_p_t rtn;        /* a return value */
    } ptr;
    ...
    ptr.string = port_any_p->s;        /* init our string pointer */         [3]
	...
	ptr.string += port_any_p->length;                                        [4]
    return (ptr.rtn);

```

Here `port_any_p` is `secadrp` from [1] above. At [3] a new pointer is initialized, and at [4] `port_any_p->length` is added. Obviously, no checks are performed regarding `port_any_p->length`, meaning that the returned pointer can be influenced by an attacker.

Specifically, `port_any_p->length` above is of type `uint16_t` with a maximum value of `0xffff`. The library uses buffers of `0x5000` bytes to receive network data. As a result, an attacker can set the value of the new pointer by up to `0xffff-0x5000 = 0xafff` bytes beyond the end of `pkt_p`. After the calculation, it is a matter of how this specific pointer is used in order to assess exploitation.

After the function returns, `presp` is passed to `unpack_pres_list()`:

```
    ...
    authp = unpack_pres_result_list (presp, swap, end_of_pkt, &st);
    ...

	INTERNAL rpc_cn_auth_tlr_p_t unpack_pres_result_list
	(
	    rpc_cn_pres_result_list_p_t presp,
	    boolean32                   swap,
	    unsigned8                   *end_of_pkt,
	    unsigned32                  *st
	)
	{
	...
    prn = presp->n_results;                                                   [5]
    for (n = 0; (n < prn) && swap; n++)
    {
        SWAP_INPLACE_16 (&presp->pres_results[n].result, end_of_pkt, st);     [6]
        if (*st != rpc_s_ok)
        {
            return (NULL);
        }
		...

```

At [5] we see `presp` being used to get a counter and iterate over a list, calling `SWAP_INPLACE_16()` for each element from `presp->pres_results`. At first glance this appears to lead to memory corruption, as it leads to a `SWAB_16` macro that swaps the order of bytes at [8] :

```
#define SWAP_INPLACE_16(ptr, end_of_pkt, st) { \
    if (((unsigned8 *) (ptr) + 1) < (const unsigned8 *) (end_of_pkt)) \    [7]
    { \
        *(ptr) = SWAB_16(*(ptr)); \                                        [8]
        *(st) = rpc_s_ok; \
    } \
    else \
    { \
        *(st) = rpc_s_bad_pkt; \
    } \
}
#endif /* SWAP_INPLACE_16 */

```

At [7] however we see that the code actually checks if the pointer is beyond `end_of_pkt`, which very descriptively holds the address of the last byte of the network packet received.
As a result, the code at [8] that would be able to actually lead to a more promising memory corruption scenario is not executed.

In conclusion, the vulnerability does not appear capable of achieving a write primitive but is capable of performing a Denial of Service attack if, for instance, `presp` points inside a guard page depending on the memory layout of the target.
