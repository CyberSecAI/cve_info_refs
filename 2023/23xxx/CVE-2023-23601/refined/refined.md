Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23601:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks when handling drag-and-drop actions of URLs from cross-origin iframes within the same browser tab. Specifically, navigations were being triggered when a URL was dragged from a cross-origin iframe and dropped within the same tab.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of drag-and-drop events involving cross-origin iframes.
- Lack of validation to prevent navigations triggered by dragging URLs within the same tab.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Website spoofing attacks could be carried out by exploiting the ability to cause an unexpected navigation. A malicious website embedded in an iframe could trick a user into navigating to a URL they didn't intend to.
- The vulnerability could also lead to the sending of user cookies, potentially bypassing SameSite cookie protections if a navigation is triggered by dragging a URL. Although this behavior is consistent with other browsers when dragging to a new tab/window, the same-tab navigation made it easier to trick users into performing the action.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious website embeds a cross-origin iframe that contains a link.
- A user drags the link from the iframe and drops it within the same browser tab.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website that can be embedded in an iframe on a victim's website.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to drag a URL from the embedded iframe and drop it within the same tab.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented involved checking the `WindowContext` of the drag source and drop target to ensure they are not within the same tab, preventing the unwanted navigation from occuring.
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a SameSite cookies bypass but further analysis revealed that the drag and drop action is akin to a user triggered navigation, where cookies should be sent. However the ability to perform this type of navigation within the same tab made it an issue.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7.
- A related bug, [CVE-2023-28164](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1809122), was filed to address a similar issue where removing the iframe during the drag operation would bypass the fix implemented for CVE-2023-23601.
