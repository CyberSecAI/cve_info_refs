Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android stores notification permissions. It was not distinguishing between normal and private browsing contexts when storing these permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inconsistent Permission Handling:** Notification permissions granted in normal browsing mode were incorrectly applied to private browsing mode.
*   **Lack of Context Awareness:** The system failed to recognize the different browsing contexts (normal vs. private) when retrieving permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unexpected Notifications:** Websites could potentially send notifications in private browsing sessions even if the user hadn't granted permission in that specific context. This leads to unexpected and potentially unwanted notifications.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The user's expectation that private browsing mode provides a separate, isolated environment for browsing is violated, potentially leaking browsing activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A website could request and be granted notification permissions in a normal browsing session.
*   If the user then opens the same website in a private browsing session, the previously granted permissions are incorrectly applied, potentially allowing unwanted notifications in the private session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker is a website that can request notification permissions.
*   The attacker must rely on the user visiting the site in both normal and private browsing modes to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No special privileges or capabilities are needed other than the ability to request web push notifications.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue is specific to Firefox for Android. Other platforms are unaffected.
*   The fix involves ensuring that notification permissions are stored and applied separately for normal and private browsing modes.
*   The bug was reported by Kazuki Nomoto of Waseda University.
*   The fix landed in Firefox 109.
*   The issue was classified as a "moderate" security vulnerability.
*   The fix was verified by QA.
*   The related bugzilla ticket is [Bug 1787034](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1787034).
