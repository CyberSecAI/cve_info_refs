The provided content is related to CVE-2023-23950.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, which allows for the injection of CRLF sequences into the response headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Response Splitting: The application does not properly sanitize user input, specifically CRLF sequences, which can be used to manipulate the response headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By injecting CRLF sequences, an attacker can split the HTTP response into multiple responses, which can be leveraged for various attacks such as:
-   HTTP Header Injection: Allows the attacker to set arbitrary HTTP headers.
-   Cross-site scripting (XSS): In some cases, it could be possible to inject malicious scripts by manipulating the headers, leading to XSS.
-   Cache Poisoning: Manipulating response headers could result in cached content being altered for other users.
-   Session Hijacking: By manipulating certain headers, an attacker could potentially gain access to a user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not sanitized before being used in the response headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a request with malicious input containing CRLF sequences. The attacker does not require any special privileges or to be authenticated, but they need to be able to interact with the vulnerable web application.
