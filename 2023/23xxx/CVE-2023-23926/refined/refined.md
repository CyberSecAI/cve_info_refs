    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted XML file via the `apoc.import.graphml` procedure.",
    "required_capabilities": "Low privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable `apoc.import.graphml` procedure, typically by interacting with the database."
