- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code in `multi_client_server.c` at line 213 allocates memory for `newAsdu` using `CS101_ASDU_create` but does not free this memory after use, leading to a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak. The allocated memory for `newAsdu` is not released.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The program will continuously leak memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and program instability if run for extended periods.
- **Attack vectors:** Not applicable in this case, as it's a programming error rather than a remotely exploitable vulnerability. It is triggered by running the program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special capabilities or position, they just need to run the program. The memory leak happens as part of the normal operation.
