# What is AvantFAX?

[![AvantFAX Screenshot](/img/screenshots/avantfax-sm.png "AvantFAX Screenshot")](screenshots.php)

AvantFAX® is a [web application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) for managing faxes on [HylaFAX](http://www.hylafax.org)™ fax servers.

AvantFAX allows users on any platform to **view and send faxes without having to install special software**. It also allows administrators to manage users, their permissions, fax lines, fax categories, etc.

AvantFAX can be accessed from the local network and remotely via Internet using standard networking equipment.

## Why should my company/organization be interested?

AvantFAX is **open source** and is released under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) just like Linux and HylaFAX.

* Do you have multiple users who need to use the fax machine?
* Do you need an efficient way to [archive and search](document-management.php) your sent and received faxes?
* Do you need a system that is robust enough to handle multiple fax lines and thousands of faxes without ''crashing''?
* Do you need to fax the same document to multiple recipients?
* Do you need a solution that you can customize and integrate into your document workflow?

If you've answered yes, AvantFAX is definitely what you're looking for. Also, [commercial support and custom installations](support.php) are available.

## Features

* Users can view faxes online with any standard web browser (IE6/7, Mozilla/Firefox, Safari, and Opera)
* Download your faxes in PDF format
* Recognizable fax numbers can have their faxes forwarded directly to an email address in PDF format
* Users can forward faxes via email without the need of an email client
* Enhanced [cover page](faxcover.php) support for HylaFAX
* Theme support (using Smarty) (AvantFAX 3.x series)
* Unlimited users
* Unlimited fax lines - the number of fax lines managed by AvantFAX is not limited
* Email to FAX support
* Blacklisting support using DynamicConfig RejectCall
* Barcode based routing (requires HylaFAX EE 3)
* DID/DTMF-based routing support
* [OCR support](ocr-support.php) (using Tesseract) for improved keyword searching (AvantFAX 3.0.2+)
* Address book importer for both Email addresses and Fax numbers in vCard (.vcf) format
* Multiple [language](languages.php) support - each user can use the interface in their native language
* ![AvantFAX Archive](/img/firefox-search.jpg)Fax archive - search your fax archive for received and sent faxes by company, date, category, and keyword.

## Advantages

* Easily monitor and log what your users are faxing and to where
* Faxes are stored in PDF format instead of a proprietary file format
* Users on any platform use the same identical interface
* Faxes are archived on the server instead of in filing cabinets
* Eliminates multiple fax machines in a single facility
* Send faxes directly from your computer with email confirmation
* Reduces paper and toner use in both the fax machine and office printer
* Online address book helps reduce human input error
