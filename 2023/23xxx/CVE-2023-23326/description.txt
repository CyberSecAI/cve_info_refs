A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AvantFAX 3.3.7. An authenticated low privilege user can inject arbitrary Javascript into their e-mail address which is executed when an administrator logs into AvantFAX to view the admin dashboard. This may result in stealing an administrator's session cookie and hijacking their session.
