- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient length validation in the Open5GS GTP library when parsing extension headers in GPRS tunneling protocol (GTPv1-U) messages. Specifically, a zero-length extension header causes an infinite loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation when processing GTPv1-U extension headers. The code does not handle a zero-length header and enters an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to denial of service (DoS) due to the affected process becoming unresponsive and consuming excessive resources. The vulnerability affects key network functions in LTE and 5G mobile packet cores such as UPF, SMF, and SGW-U. This can also degrade the functionality of other active services on the same host.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor sends a crafted GTPv1-U message with a zero-length extension header. This can be achieved with any GTPv1-U message type, even those that don't require an existing GPRS tunnel, such as a *Supported Extension Headers Notification*.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted GTPv1-U message to any affected Open5GS endpoint. The attacker does not require any prior privileges, and the attack can be performed over the network.
