# Path traversal vulnerability that may lead to type confusion in URI handling code

Low

[stephanebruckert](/stephanebruckert)
published
GHSA-q764-g6fm-555v
Jan 23, 2023

## Package

pip

spotipy
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=2.22.0

## Patched versions

2.22.1

## Description

### Summary

If a malicious URI is passed to the library, the library can be tricked into performing an operation on a different API endpoint than intended.

### Details

The [code Spotipy uses to parse URIs and URLs](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/client.py#L1942)  accepts user data too liberally which allows a malicious user to insert arbitrary characters into the path that is used for API requests. Because it is possible to include `..`, an attacker can redirect for example a track lookup via `spotifyApi.track()` to an arbitrary API endpoint like playlists, but this is possible for other endpoints as well.

Before the security advisory feature was enabled on GitHub, I was already in contact with Stéphane Bruckert via e-mail, and he asked me to look into a potential fix.

My recommendation is to perform stricter parsing of URLs and URIs, which I implemented in the patch included at the end of the report. If you prefer, I can also invite you to a private fork of the repository.

### PoC

The POC expects `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables to be set to authenticate against the API.

```
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

def main():
    spotifyApi = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())

    # This URL contains the example playlist ID from the spotify docs, a malicious
    # playlist could instead contain a XSS payload in their title. A playlist with
    # such a title was also included in the initial report via mail to maintainer.
    malicious_spotify_url = 'spotify:track:../playlists/3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n'

    # Usage of the track function, expecting to get a non-user-controllable track name
    # e.g. for displaying in a website.
    # Our modified track uri however makes the library return the name of a playlist which
    # may be created by anyone containing anything.
    track = spotifyApi.track(malicious_spotify_url)

    # Prints:
    # 'Name of the track: Spotify Web API Testing playlist'
    # A malicious playlist could also have an XSS payload as title, which would result in:
    # 'Name of the track: <img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>'
    print(f"Name of the track: {track['name']}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on what operations a client application performs when it handles a URI from a user and how it uses the responses it receives from the API.

### Possible Patch

#### Caviats of this patch

* The ID parsing functionality now newly raises `ValueError` if it cannot parse an ID, instead of logging a warning or silently passing back whatever it received as input.
  + **WARNING** I only adjusted unit tests to expect `ValueError` that didn't require a valid user session, other tests may also need adjustment
* Unfortunately, I could not find conclusive documentation on what constitutes a valid Spotify username, but apparently some exist that contain alphanumeric characters, mine just contains numbers and the ones of newly created accounts seem to follow the base-62 scheme. You as developers probably have deeper insight into this, otherwise it probably will have to be discovered via bug reports if additional characters are valid as well.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
