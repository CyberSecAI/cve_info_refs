```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the caching mechanism of parsed Accept-Language headers in Django. To avoid repetitive parsing, Django caches these header values. However, when very large Accept-Language header values are sent, excessive memory usage occurs, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Improper input validation: Django did not limit the size of Accept-Language headers, allowing attackers to send arbitrarily large values.
- Insufficient memory management: The caching mechanism was not designed to handle the potentially very large headers, resulting in excessive memory consumption

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption on the server.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests with very large Accept-Language header values.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Django server. No specific position is needed.
