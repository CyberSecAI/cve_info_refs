Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `pg_ivm` extension executing functions without specifying schema names during the refresh of an Incrementally Maintainable Materialized View (IMMV). This behavior allows for the possibility of the extension being tricked into executing functions from other schemas than intended, using the IMMV owner's privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):**  The primary weakness is the lack of explicit schema qualification when executing functions during IMMV refresh, making the system susceptible to search path manipulation.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the uncontrolled search path, an attacker can cause the execution of malicious functions with the privileges of the IMMV owner, potentially escalating their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Function Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary functions from a schema they control by inserting them into the search path used during the IMMV refresh process.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker-controlled functions are executed with the privileges of the IMMV owner, which can lead to further compromise.
- **Data Integrity and Confidentiality:**  The exploitation can lead to unauthorized data modification or disclosure based on the attacker's code.
- **Availability Impact:** It's implied but not explicitly stated that a crafted function could also cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is **Network** based, implying that the attacker does not need physical access to the machine.
- The attack involves manipulating the search path used by `pg_ivm` during the refresh of an IMMV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker needs low privileges and the ability to create functions in the database.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction.
- The attacker needs the ability to create a function within the database that would be executed in place of a legitimate function when refreshing an IMMV.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The vulnerability exists in `pg_ivm` versions prior to 1.5.1.
- The fix in version 1.5.1 includes using qualified function names during maintenance and rebuilding the query for recalculating min/max after a `search_path` change.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8.
- The EPSS score is 0.232%, indicating a low probability of exploitation.
