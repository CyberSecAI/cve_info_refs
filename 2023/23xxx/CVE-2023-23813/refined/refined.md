- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The My Calendar plugin for WordPress versions <= 3.4.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions performed by the victim user, such as modifying settings, adding/deleting content etc. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to induce a logged-in user to make a request to the vulnerable plugin on their behalf. This is typically done by sending a crafted link via email, social media, or other methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that triggers a forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
