- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect behavior order in the Command Centre Server during access decisions when competencies are used, specifically after a network outage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper handling of access control logic when network connectivity is lost, leading to extended physical access beyond the intended duration.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Privileged users can gain physical access to the site for longer than intended after a network outage.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a network outage in combination with the use of competencies in access decisions, and requires a privileged user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a privileged user and needs a network outage to be able to prolong physical access.
