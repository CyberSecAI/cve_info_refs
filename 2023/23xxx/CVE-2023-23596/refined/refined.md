Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23596:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when creating access lists. Specifically, the `username` and `password` fields provided by the user are directly concatenated into a command that is then executed by the `utils.exec()` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into these fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to OS command injection due to the unsanitized user input being used to construct a shell command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the application is running, leading to:
    - Full system compromise
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of service
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/nginx/access-lists` endpoint.
- The attacker manipulates the `username` or `password` fields in the request payload, inserting shell commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated, possessing a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) to make the request.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/api/nginx/access-lists`.
- The attacker needs to craft a JSON payload with malicious commands inserted into either the `username` or `password` field.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how the attack can be performed by injecting the command `touch “pwned”` into the password field, resulting in the creation of an empty "pwned" file on the server. This highlights the practical nature of the vulnerability and the ease with which it can be exploited. The vulnerability is located in `/backend/internal/access-list.js` file. The vulnerable code is located within the **build** method, where the `/usr/bin/htpasswd` command is executed.
