Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23914:

**1. Verification:**
The provided information contains details about CVE-2023-23914, which relates to a vulnerability in the curl command-line tool's HSTS implementation when handling multiple requests. The descriptions match the official CVE description.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the HSTS state was not properly carried over between multiple requests on the same command line, leading to subsequent requests ignoring previously acquired HSTS information. This was introduced in commit `7385610d0c7` and enabled by default in `d71ff2b9db566b3f`.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Improper state handling of HSTS data within the curl command-line tool when processing multiple URLs serially.
   - Failure to propagate HSTS information from a previous request to a subsequent request in the same command line execution.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - HSTS, which is meant to enforce secure HTTPS connections, is bypassed.
   -  Subsequent HTTP requests to a host which previously provided HSTS headers would not be upgraded to HTTPS.
   -  Potential for downgrade attacks or exposure of sensitive information transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, when HTTPS was expected to be used due to HSTS.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   -  An attacker could trick a user into using `curl` with a chain of requests, first to a legitimate site that sets HSTS and then to the same site using `http://`, causing the second request to not be upgraded to HTTPS.
   - The vulnerability is exposed when using the curl command-line tool with multiple URLs serially.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker needs the ability to influence the curl command execution, specifically, specifying multiple URLs in sequence, with at least one URL providing HSTS headers
   - No special network position is required, the attacker could just provide an URL to the user to execute with curl.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects the curl command-line tool and not the libcurl library.
- The vulnerability was fixed in curl version 7.88.0.
- The vulnerability was assigned a low severity due to the limited impact.
- The vulnerability is related to the HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) feature.
- The vulnerability was reported by Harry Sintonen and patched by Daniel Stenberg.
