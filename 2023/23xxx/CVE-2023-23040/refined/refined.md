Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The TP-Link TL-WR940N V6 router (firmware version 3.19.1 Build 180119) uses the deprecated MD5 hashing algorithm to hash the administrator's password for Basic Authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a weak and deprecated cryptographic hash function (MD5) for password storage.
- Basic Authentication over HTTP, which sends credentials in base64 encoding without proper encryption if HTTPS is not used, making it easy to intercept.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who intercepts an authenticated request can easily crack the admin's password hash due to the weakness of MD5.
-  This results in the attacker gaining access to the router's management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- Interception of network traffic containing the Base64-encoded HTTP Basic Authentication credentials during a request to the router.
- Using readily available tools to crack the MD5 hash of the password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic to and from the router, which means being on the same network as the router or having a man-in-the-middle position.

**Additional details:**
- The vendor confirmed the issue and released a new firmware version (TL-WR940N(EU)\_V6\_3.20.1 Build 220801) to fix it.
- The issue is categorized under CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and OWASP WSTG-CRYP-04 (Testing for Weak Encryption).
