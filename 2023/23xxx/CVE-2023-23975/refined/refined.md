*  **Missing Authentication/Authorization checks:** The plugin is not implementing necessary security checks for certain functions, making it vulnerable to access control issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability to execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact of this will vary based on the context of the vulnerable function within the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerable functions lacking access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
