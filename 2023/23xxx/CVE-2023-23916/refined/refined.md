{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-23916",
  "description": "curl supports 'chained' HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable 'links' in this 'decompression chain' was capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using many headers.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way curl handles chained HTTP compression algorithms. The limit on the number of decompression steps was applied on a per-header basis, not on the total chain length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious server can exploit this by sending multiple headers with compression directives, leading to excessive memory allocation in curl. This can result in a denial of service due to a 'malloc bomb,' causing curl to exhaust available heap memory or return out-of-memory errors.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious server sends a crafted HTTP response with multiple 'Content-Encoding' or 'Transfer-Encoding' headers, each specifying a compression algorithm. By chaining multiple compression steps, the server forces curl to allocate large amounts of memory during decompression.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a server that curl is connecting to."
  },
  "affected_versions": "curl 7.57.0 to 7.87.0",
  "fixed_versions": "curl >= 7.88.0",
  "patch_details": "The fix limits the number of accepted chained algorithms to 5 in total, regardless of the number of headers."
