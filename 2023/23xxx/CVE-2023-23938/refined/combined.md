| Summary \*XSS through the name of a color of select box values |
| --- |

Original Submission

XSS can injected in the name of a color of select box values of a tracker and then reflected in the tracker administration. A previous [request #11685](https://tuleap.net/goto?key=request&val=11685&group_id=101 "Artefact - Bugs") removed injection points in trackers and agile dashboard, but new injection point has been introduced lately.

### Impact

An attacker could use this vulnerability to force a victim to execute uncontrolled code.

CVSSv3 score: 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Exploitation

As a tracker admin edit the color of a selectbox value and intercept the request to replace the name of the color by a payload like `"><script>alert(1)</script>` to demonstrate the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
