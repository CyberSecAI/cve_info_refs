Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Easy Panorama WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to:
    - Redirection of users to malicious sites.
    - Display of unwanted advertisements.
    - Theft of session cookies.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious scripts, which are executed when guests visit the site. This implies the XSS is likely stored or reflected through some user-controlled input that isn't properly handled by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable input of the plugin.
    - An administrator-level privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability.
