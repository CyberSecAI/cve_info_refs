Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23131:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Selfwealth iOS mobile app version 3.3.1 has insecure App Transport Security (ATS) settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure App Transport Security (ATS) settings. ATS is designed to enforce secure connections between an app and its backend. When not properly configured, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability, due to insecure ATS settings, can potentially lead to accidental disclosure of sensitive information due to insecure connections between the app and its backend.
-The insecure settings could be exploited to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks (Man-in-the-Middle) are likely the attack vector for exploiting this vulnerability by intercepting communications between the app and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable app and its backend server, such as being on the same Wi-Fi network or having control of a network device involved in the communication path.
- No user interaction is explicitly mentioned, which implies the vulnerability is exploited through the app's network traffic, not through user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content specifies that ATS "prevents accidental disclosure, provides secure default behavior, and is easy to adopt". This implies that the application is not properly utilizing or has disabled this security feature.
- The content mentions "it is also on by default in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11", suggesting the app's settings are explicitly overriding this default.
- This is a configuration issue rather than a code flaw.
