- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the WordPress Shortcodes Plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be reserved for higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control due to missing authorization, authentication or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited. However, the potential impact is that unprivileged users could execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact would vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function within the WordPress Shortcodes Plugin that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user, indicating the vulnerability is accessible without needing to log in or have any specific user role within the WordPress site.
