Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability in Stormshield Endpoint Security (SES) Evolution allows an authenticated user to bypass access checks.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in a flaw in the access control mechanism of the SES Evolution server, specifically when updating global parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged authenticated user can modify global parameters that they should not have access to, potentially impacting the application's availability. This could lead to a disruption of service. While confidentiality is impacted, the integrity of the system is not directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is an adjacent network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SES Evolution server, though the specific user profile is not relevant.
*   The attacker needs local access to the console, to be able to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack has low complexity, requiring minimal effort to execute.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects SES versions 2.3.0 to 2.3.2.
*   The fix is available in version 2.4.1.
*   The CVSS score is 6.3 (Base) and 5.5 (Temporal).
*   There is no workaround solution.
