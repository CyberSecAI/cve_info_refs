The provided content is related to CVE-2023-23847.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Synopsys Coverity Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests for those endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a request to a vulnerable HTTP endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins
- The attacker must be able to obtain credentials IDs, possibly through another vulnerability
