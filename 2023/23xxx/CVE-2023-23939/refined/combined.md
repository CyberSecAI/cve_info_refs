# Azure/setup-kubectl: Escalation of privilege vulnerability for v3 and lower

Low

[OliverMKing](/OliverMKing)
published
GHSA-p756-rfxh-x63h
Mar 6, 2023

## Package

actions

Azure/setup-kubectl
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

< v2

## Patched versions

>= v3

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability only impacts versions `v2` and lower. An insecure temporary creation of a file allows other actors on the Actions runner to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is world writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs `fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath, 777)` to set permissions on the Kubectl binary, however, this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl binary. This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run kubectl, most likely root. This attack is only possible if an attacker somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or if a user is utilizing an Action that maliciously executes this attack.

No impacted customers have been reported.

### Patches

This has been fixed and released in all versions `v3` and later. 755 permissions are used instead.

### Workarounds

If users absolutely cannot upgrade to `v3` or higher than they should be extra diligent of the other GitHub actions they are using in a workflow and ensure that their GitHub actions runner is secure.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
