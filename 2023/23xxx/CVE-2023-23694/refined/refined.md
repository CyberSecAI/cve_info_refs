**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection: The application allows the execution of arbitrary OS commands by injecting them into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary OS Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the VxRail Manager application.
- System Takeover: This can lead to a complete system takeover by the attacker due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system where VxRail Manager is running.
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to log into the system.
- High Privileges: While the CVE description mentions "local authenticated attacker," the privileges they require are not explicitly specified.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected Product: Dell VxRail versions earlier than 7.0.450 are affected.
