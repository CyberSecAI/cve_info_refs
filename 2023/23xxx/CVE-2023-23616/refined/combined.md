This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

SECURITY: Limit the character count of group membership requests ([#19993](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/19993)

```
)

When creating a group membership request, there is no character
limit on the 'reason' field. This can be potentially be used by
an attacker to create enormous amount of data in the database.

# Group membership requests lack character limit

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

stable <= 3.0.0; beta <= 3.0.0.beta16; tests-passed <= 3.0.0.beta16

## Patched versions

stable > 3.0.0; beta > 3.0.0.beta16; tests-passed > 3.0.0.beta16

## Description

### Impact

Currently, when submitting a membership request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to administrators.

### Patches

In the patched versions, a limit of 280 characters has been introduced for membership requests.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
