Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString` method creating a duplicate `SystemPrincipal` object when parsing a non-system HTML document. This occurs because, after a previous fix (bug 1467970), `DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString` started creating a new `SystemPrincipal` instance when parsing a non-system principal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Duplicate SystemPrincipal:** The core issue is the creation of multiple `SystemPrincipal` objects, violating the assumption that there's only a single instance.
*   **Pointer Identity Checks:**  Gecko code often checks if a principal is the system principal by comparing pointer identities. With duplicate instances, these checks fail, leading to potential bypass of security measures.
*   **Bypassed Security Checks:**  Specifically, code like `nsContentUtils::IsChromeDoc` which relies on pointer identity to identify the system principal failed to correctly identify a chrome -> content adoption when multiple `SystemPrincipal` existed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Security Checks:** The duplicate `SystemPrincipal` objects could lead to bypassing web security checks, though the precise details are unclear. The issue was triggered in the context of a short-lived chrome-only document, which limited the immediate exploitability.
*   **Node Adoption Issues**: In the reported case, the creation of multiple system principals broke the intended adoption of nodes between a chrome and content document, though this was an unintended side effect.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Parsing a non-system HTML document using `DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString` in a context that expects only one `SystemPrincipal` object, allowing a less secure context to create duplicate SystemPrincipal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to influence the content being passed to the `DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString`, potentially through a crafted or manipulated HTML.
*   The attacker would need to chain this with further exploits that leverage the bypass of security checks allowed by the duplicate SystemPrincipal

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is rated as **low** severity due to the limited scope of its impact and the specific conditions required to trigger the issue. The lack of a direct exploit scenario also contributed to the low rating.
*   The fix involved changing the behavior of `DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString` to always mimic the target document's principal, ensuring that a single, consistent `SystemPrincipal` object is used within a particular context.
*   The fix was included in Firefox 109 and later versions.
