An observable response discrepancy in the Gallagher Command Centre RESTAPI allows an insufficiently-privileged user to infer the presence of items that would not otherwise be viewable. 

This issue affects: Gallagher Command Centre 8.70 prior to vEL8.70.1787 (MR2), 8.60 prior to vEL8.60.2039 (MR4), all version of 8.50 and prior.
