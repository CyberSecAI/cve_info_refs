Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the "Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication".  The SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR allows an attacker to authenticate using a password hash, rather than the actual password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-836:** Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication. This indicates a flaw in the authentication mechanism where the system accepts a password hash directly as a valid credential.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Impact:** High. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a valid user account by using the password hash instead of the password. This gives them access to sensitive information and configurations of the device.
- **Integrity Impact:** None is explicitly mentioned.
- **Availability Impact:** None is explicitly mentioned.
- The overall impact is rated as medium due to the confidentiality breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely via the REST interface.
- **Local:** CVSS score indicates Local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must be able to access the REST interface of the SICK FTMg device.
-   The attacker must have obtained a valid password hash for a user account on the device. This could potentially be achieved through other vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-23448 or CVE-2023-23449.
-   The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability

**Affected Products:**

- The following SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR products are affected with firmware versions prior to v2.x:
  - SICK FTMG-ESD15AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1100214)
  - SICK FTMG-ESD20AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1100215)
  - SICK FTMG-ESD25AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1100216)
  - SICK FTMG-ESR40SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1120114)
  - SICK FTMG-ESR50SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1120116)
  - SICK FTMG-ESN40SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1122524)
  - SICK FTMG-ESN50SXX AIR FLOW SENSOR (Part Number: 1122526)

**Remediation:**

- The primary remediation is to follow general security practices, such as network segmentation, as a workaround.
- The document states that a new firmware version (v3.0.0.131.Release) has been released, which addresses other related vulnerabilities but does not explicitly fix this one.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the typical password-based authentication process, directly leveraging password hashes.
- The provided document is a CSAF (Common Security Advisory Framework) document, providing a structured format for security advisories.
