- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Books Gallery Plugin versions 4.4.8 and earlier lack proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, where an attacker crafts a malicious request that is then executed by a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request, typically by embedding it on a website or through a link in an email. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
