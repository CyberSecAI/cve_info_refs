Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-23613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the implementation of field-level security (FLS) and field masking within OpenSearch. Specifically, rules designed to explicitly exclude fields are not correctly applied when queries utilize the auto-generated `.keyword` fields associated with those excluded fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect application of exclusion rules:** Field-level security rules intended to restrict access to specific fields are bypassed when queries use the corresponding `.keyword` fields. This means that even if a field is explicitly excluded, its `.keyword` variant might still be accessible.
*   **Bypass of field masking:** Similar to FLS, field masking rules designed to prevent access to sensitive data by masking it are bypassed when using `.keyword` fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker with read access to indexes containing restricted fields can potentially gain access to the sensitive data that should have been excluded or masked. This is due to the vulnerability affecting how `.keyword` fields are handled in FLS rules.
*   **No impact on Integrity or Availability**: The vulnerability has no impact on the integrity or availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based as the vulnerability is accessible through network interactions with the OpenSearch service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with read access to the affected indexes.
*   **Knowledge of field names:** The attacker needs to know the name of restricted fields and utilize its `.keyword` variant in the crafted queries.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to use the system for sending the requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered moderate in severity with a CVSS score of 5.7.
*   The provided content includes the CVSS vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` which provides details on the attack vector, complexity, privileges required, and the impact on confidentiality.
*   The vulnerability was found in OpenSearch versions 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1
*   Patched versions are 1.3.8 and 2.5.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-1230.
*   A workaround exists which involves explicitly granting access rather than using exclusion rules to restrict fields.
