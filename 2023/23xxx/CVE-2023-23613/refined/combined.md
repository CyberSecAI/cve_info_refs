# Field-level security issue with .keyword fields

Moderate

[CEHENKLE](/CEHENKLE)
published
GHSA-v3cg-7r9h-r2g6
Jan 24, 2023

## Package

docker

OpenSearch
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<1.3.8, <2.5.0

## Patched versions

>=1.3.8, >=2.5.0

## Description

### Advisory title: Field-level security issue with .keyword fields

### Affected versions:

OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1

### Patched versions:

OpenSearch 1.3.8 and 2.5.0

### Impact:

There is an issue in the implementation of field-level security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to explicitly exclude fields are not correctly applied for certain queries that rely on their auto-generated .keyword fields.

This issue is only present for authenticated users with read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields.

### Workaround:

FLS rules that use explicit exclusions can be written to grant explicit access instead. Policies authored in this way are not subject to this issue.

### Patches:

OpenSearch versions 1.3.8 and 2.5.0 contain a fix for this issue.

### For more information:

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (<https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/>) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
