- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing or inadequate CSRF protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker could craft a malicious link or embed a form on a website or in an email, which when clicked by an authenticated user of the vulnerable plugin, can be used to trigger unwanted actions on the target site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website but needs the victim to be authenticated to the WordPress site. The attacker would need to know the specific actions that they want to trigger.
