- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Really Simple Google Tag Manager Plugin versions 1.0.6 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, leading to unauthorized modifications or other malicious behavior within the plugin's context.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through CSRF attacks, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a higher-privileged user into interacting with the malicious request. The attacker does not need prior authentication but needs to exploit the user's existing authentication.
