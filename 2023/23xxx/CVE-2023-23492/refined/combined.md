Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Quick Event Manager : CVE-2023-23491 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 9.7.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the 'category' parameter of the 'qem\_ajax\_calendar' action, as the parameter is reflected in the response without prior filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function 'qem\_show\_calendar()' of the file 'legacy/quick-event-manager.php'.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=qem_ajax_calendar&category=</script><script>alert(1)</script>

```

---

**Login with Phone Number : CVE-2023-23492 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.4.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The 'ID' parameter of the 'lwp\_forgot\_password' action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS. Although the response is encoded in JSON, the Content-Type of the response is text/html which allows the exploitation of the vulnerability. This vulnerability is present in the './login-with-phonenumber.php' file in the 'lwp\_forgot\_password()' function.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=lwp_forgot_password&ID=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>

```

---

**WP Helper Lite : CVE-2023-0448 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-helper-lite/

**Affected Versions:** < 4.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The plugin displays all of the user's GET parameters in the response to the **surveySubmit** action without any filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function '**surveySubmit\_func()'** of the file '**includes/class-mbwp-helper.php**'

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=surveySubmit&aaa=xxx"><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter : CVE-2023-28664 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-meta-data-filter-and-taxonomy-filter/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.3.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The plugin appears to have an incorrect usage of the core function '**esc\_html\_\_**' which can lead to a reflected XSS via the '**tax\_name**' parameter.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mdf_get_tax_options_in_widget&tax_name=<svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Woo Bulk Price Update : CVE-2023-28665 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-bulk-price-update/

**Affected Versions:** < 2.2.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**page**' parameter to the **techno\_get\_products** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to a reflected XSS.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=techno_get_products&page=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**InPost Gallery : CVE-2023-28666 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/inpost-gallery/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.4.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**imgurl**' parameter to the **add\_inpost\_gallery\_slide\_item** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS which could be triggered against authenticated users.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=add_inpost_gallery_slide_item&imgurl="><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0502](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0502)

  ###### medium

  ###### medium

  A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0. This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php.

The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

* Event List
* Event Calendar

## Installation

1. Login to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to ‘Plugins’, ‘Add New’ then search for ‘quick event manager’.
3. Select the plugin then ‘Install Now’.
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Go to the plugin ‘Settings’ page to change how the events display.
6. Go to your permalinks page and re-save to activate the custom posts.
7. Add new events using the event editor on your dashboard
8. To use the form in your posts and pages add the shortcode `[qem]`.

## FAQ

### How do I add a new event?

In the main dashboard, click on ‘event’ then ‘add new’.

### What’s the shortcode?

[qem]

If you just want a calendar use the shortcode [qemcalendar]

### How do I change the colours and things?

Use the plugin settings page. You can’t style individual events, they all look the same.

But you can change lots of colours on the calendar

### Can I add more fields?

No.

### Why not?

Well OK yes you can add more fields if you want but you are going to have to fiddle about with the php file which needs a bit of care and attention. Everything you need to know is in the [wordpress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/quick-event-manager)

I was having so many issues with another popular plugin for events. I switched to this and within minutes had all the issues solved that were problems with the other plugin. Seems to be a faster plugin as well. Great plugin so far! Lots of help on the forum.

### [Great support!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-support-4423/)

September 8, 2022

We had a problem after an update with the plugin failing in an old version of PHP (yea, I know…). Within hours they responded, helped figure out that was our problem, made a code change so it worked, and issued a new version of the plugin. If I could I’d give them more than five stars for their incredible support!

After upgrading WordPress, some of the functionality broke. After contacting support Alan promptly took his time to guide me thru the debugging process until we found a solution that worked.
