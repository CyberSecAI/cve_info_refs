# EthAccount can be impersonated by malicious prover

Moderate

[martriay](/martriay)
published
GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4
Feb 1, 2023

## Package

openzeppelin-cairo-contracts

## Affected versions

>=0.2.0 <0.6.1

## Patched versions

0.6.1

## Description

### Cause

`is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`.

### Impact

As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts.

### Risk

In order to exploit this vulnerability, it is required to control a sequencer or prover since they're the ones executing the hints, being able to inject incorrect keccak results.

Today StarkWare is the only party running both a prover or a sequencer, greatly reducing the risk of exploit.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Contracts for Cairo repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/new/choose)
* Email us at security@openzeppelin.com

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-23940

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
