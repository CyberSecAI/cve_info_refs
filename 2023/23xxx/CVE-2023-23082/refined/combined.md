## Description

![@dhje0ng](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50125695?u=f9ff6a74c0000015f01298c110cf90acb17081cd&v=4&size=48)[dhje0ng](https://github.com/dhje0ng)opened [on Jan 3, 2023](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/22377#issue-1517028904)
## Bug report

### Describe the bug

After inserting the wrong/malformed image file into the USB storage device and mounting it, run kodi to run the Picture application. Exifparse crashes while scanning (reading) the wrong image files included in the USB storage device, leading to the termination of the process

## Expected Behavior

If you include an invalid image file, the kodi process crashes, you can check the memory address through the internal crash log.

## Actual Behavior

## Possible Fix

1. Please check the attached crash report information. It is reporting which functions are crashing. I guess is that it has to do with CExifparse function.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Save the attached image file to a USB storage device.
2. After recognizing the USB storage device in an environment that can operate kodi, such as Raspberry Pi, run the Picture application inside kodi.
3. After a while the process crashes.
4. If you need a crash log dump, you can enable the log dump option in preferences within kodi.

Several drafted images could crash kodi. This was tested with memory, address sanitizers enabled.

The issues were long fixed upstream: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/jhead/+/2a4c12f5e5808e309b9ba04fe8b1539debf466d1](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/jhead/%2B/2a4c12f5e5808e309b9ba04fe8b1539debf466d1)

Kodi should remove the copied libexif code and use jhead directly.

This fixes: [#22377](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/22377)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Looks fine if it fixes the issues.

I agree that we need to move to using upstream libexif instead.

Sorry, something went wrong.

ExifParse: Don't run outside exif information

```
When parsing exif information the number of entries could be tainted. Make
sure to not run behind the exif data by properly checking out of bounds.
