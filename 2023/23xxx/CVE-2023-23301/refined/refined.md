The provided content is related to CVE-2023-23301.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `news` instruction in the TVM (Tiny Virtual Machine) allows creating a string by referencing a symbol, which is resolved to a virtual address within a section (code or data). While the instruction checks if the beginning of the string is within a valid section, it does not verify that the end of the string is also within the section bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The lack of a check on the end of string leads to a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- Memory disclosure: Reading beyond the bounds of the designated section can lead to disclosure of sensitive memory data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a string located at the end of a section such that when it is loaded, the read operation extends beyond the section boundary, potentially exposing sensitive memory contents.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious string with a size that extends beyond the section boundary.
- Utilizing the `news` instruction with the address of the crafted malicious string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject code/data that will be interpreted by the TVM, specifically the `news` instruction.
- Knowledge of the memory layout of the TVM, specifically the location of different sections.
