- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Interactive Geo Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will then be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts. The exact injection point isn't specified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin. The required privilege is "Contributor", so an authenticated user with this role can inject malicious code.
