# Improper size validation of L2CAP frames

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-qr4q-6h3m-h3g7
Jan 24, 2023

## Package

ble-l2cap

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured MTU size.

When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled packet. It is therefore possible that an out-of-bounds write occurs, which can be of up to 1152 bytes in Contiki-NG's default configuration.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [#2254](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2254).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-23609

### Weaknesses

[CWE-787](/advisories?query=cwe%3A787)
