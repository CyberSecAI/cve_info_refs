# Vulnerability in LTI 1.3 Grade Pass Back Implementation

Low

[alangsto](/alangsto)
published
GHSA-7j9p-67mm-5g87
Jan 24, 2023

## Package

pip

xblock-lti-consumer
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 7.0.0

## Patched versions

7.2.2

## Description

### Problem

TL;DR: Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can

post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the

block location for that XBlock.

In LTI 1.3, LTI tools can "pass back" scores that learners earn while using

LTI tools to the edX platform. The edX platform then stores those LTI

scores in a separate table. If the right conditions are met, these scores

are then persisted to the LMS grades tables.

LTI tools can create what are called "line items" on the edX platform. A

line item can be thought of as a column in a grade book; it stores results

for a specific activity (i.e. XBlock) for a specific set of users (i.e.

users in the course using the XBlock). A line item has an optional

resource\_link\_id field, which is basically the XBlock location. An LTI tool

can supply any value for this field.

An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code

that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to

upload the grades for by reading the resource\_link\_id field of the

associated line item. Because the LTI tool could have submitted any value

for the resource\_link\_id field, this introduces the potential for a

nefarious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform.

### Impact

Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a

grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows the resource\_link\_id

(i.e. block location) for that XBlock.

The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
