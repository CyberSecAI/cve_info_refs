{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-23618",
    "description": "When `gitk` is run on Windows, it potentially runs executables from the current directory inadvertently, which can be exploited with some social engineering to trick users into running untrusted code.",
    "affected_versions": "<=2.39.1",
    "patched_versions": "2.39.2",
    "root_cause": "The `gitk` application on Windows uses the Tcl `exec` command which performs a PATH lookup for executables. This allows execution of programs placed in the current working directory if they share the name of executables that the application expects to call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-426"
    ],
     "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by running malicious executables present in the current working directory.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "local": "An attacker places a malicious executable in the same directory where a user runs `gitk` or where a git repository is checked out. The executable must share a name with an executable that gitk may attempt to run, such as `wish.exe`.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs write access to the directory from which `gitk` is executed and knowledge of a program name used by gitk.",
         "required_user_interaction":"User needs to execute gitk or use Git GUI's \"Visualize History\" functionality."
    }
