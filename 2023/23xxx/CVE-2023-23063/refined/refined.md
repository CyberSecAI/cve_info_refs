The provided content describes a local file disclosure vulnerability in cellinx NVT version 1.0.6.002b.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `GetFileContent.cgi` script, which does not properly sanitize or restrict the `PATH` parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The `PATH` parameter in the `GetFileContent.cgi` script is not validated, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the system.
- Local File Inclusion: The lack of validation leads to a local file inclusion vulnerability, where the attacker can force the application to disclose the content of arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Information Disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/passwd`, `/proc/self/cmdline`, or any file accessible by the webserver user.
- Potential for further compromise: Disclosing configuration files could expose usernames, passwords, or other information that could be used for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `GetFileContent.cgi` script, including parameters like `USER`, `PWD`, and the vulnerable `PATH`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device, typically via HTTP requests to port 8081.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable URL: The attacker must know the location and format of the vulnerable `GetFileContent.cgi` script.
- Authentication Bypass: The exploit shows that authentication is bypassed, as the `USER` and `PWD` parameters are hardcoded and likely not validated, allowing access to the script without proper authorization.
