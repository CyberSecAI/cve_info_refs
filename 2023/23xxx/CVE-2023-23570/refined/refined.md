- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Client-Side enforcement of Server-Side security for the Command Centre server could be bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper client-side enforcement of server-side security controls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to invalid configuration with undefined behavior. This could potentially lead to a loss of integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks that manipulate client-side controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privilege access to the network and be able to interact with the Command Centre server.
