Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-23924

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the case-sensitive comparison of the SVG `<image>` tag name during parsing within the `dompdf` library. The code checks for the tag name "image" using a strict equality (`===`) which is case sensitive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Case-Sensitive Tag Name Check:** The primary weakness is that the code performing the check for the `<image>` tag in SVG parsing does not account for different casing. Because the check uses `$name === "image"` it can be bypassed by using "Image" or "IMAGE"
- **Bypassed URI Validation:** By using a tag such as `<Image>` instead of `<img>`, the code skips the URI validation for the `xlink:href` or `href` attributes, allowing arbitrary protocols to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary URL access:** An attacker can use the bypassed URI validation to force `dompdf` to access arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols.
- **Arbitrary Object Unserialize (PHP < 8):** In PHP versions before 8.0.0, this can be exploited using the `phar://` URL wrapper leading to arbitrary object unserialization. This can further lead to file deletion and potentially remote code execution, depending on the classes available within the application using the vulnerable library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Injection:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious SVG file to `dompdf` for processing, exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide SVG:** The attacker must be able to provide a SVG file to the `dompdf` library. This is often done by manipulating inputs to the web application where the library is being used, where it is used to process user controlled SVG files.
- **No Privilege or User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any specific user interaction or required privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in `src/Image/Cache.php` in the `resolve_url` function, where the `<image>` tag is handled when processing SVG files.
- The fix implemented is to convert the tag name to lowercase before the comparison `strtolower($name) === "image"`.
- The vulnerability is present in dompdf version 2.0.1, and fixed in version 2.0.2.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical.
