The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-23848.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Synopsys Coverity Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The plugin lacks permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing unauthorized access.
- CSRF: The HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the Jenkins instance.
- Exploiting HTTP endpoints that lack permission checks.
- Exploiting CSRF vulnerability through crafted requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to obtain valid credentials IDs through another method (CVE-2023-23850).
- Ability to establish network connections to a malicious server

**Additional details:**
- The specific vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-2793 (2).
- The vulnerability can be fixed by updating the plugin to version 3.0.3, where the affected HTTP endpoints require POST requests and appropriate permissions.
