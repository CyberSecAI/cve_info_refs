- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AutomatorWP plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the crafted malicious request. This could be done through social engineering or by including the request in a malicious website/email. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim does.
