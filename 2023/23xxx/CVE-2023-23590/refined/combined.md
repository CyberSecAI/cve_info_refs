### XENTRY Update Service Introduction and Operating Concept

The XENTRY Update Service provides your workshop online with ECU software and flash software as well as release updates for diagnostic systems. Release updates and ECU software  of the old “Regio DVD” and “Digital Operator’s Manuals” are provided online and centrally by the Mercedes Benz AG. There are two options available:

* XENTRY Update Service with Retail Data Storage device (recommended)
* XENTRY Update Service without Retail Data Storage device

Due to constantly growing data volumes as a result of further developments in control units for future vehicle model series, the storage requirements for retail data storage are increasing continuously. Therefore, fast download time and redistribution are essential.

The new Retail Data Storage 2 has a powerful 18-terabyte hard drive. Thanks to the two times higher data transfer speed compared to the predecessor model, the growing data volumes can be handled without any problems.

**Technical specification of the Retail Data Storage 2:**

| * Device: Barebone including mainboard, power adapter, rear panel and cooling system * Operating system: Ubuntu Linux LTS in the latest version * Processor: Intel Xeon E-2314 4 Core 2.8GHz 8MB * Memory: 16GB DDR4 3200 ECC UDIMM * Hard drive: 18 TB HDD SATA3 – Enterprise quality * LAN ports: 2 x RJ 45 Ports (Dual Port Intel® X710-AT2 Gigabit 10G LAN Controller) |

### Less effort for your updates

Ensure regular updates for all your XENTRY diagnostic devices with the XENTRY Update Service. Depending on the configuration, new release updates and add-ons are automatically downloaded from the Internet to your Retail Data Storage (network storage) within 48 hours of publication and immediately distributed from there to your XENTRY diagnostic devices - without effort, fully automatically and with low downtimes of your diagnostic devices. Download and installation of release updates are carried out in the background – you reduce the time required for update to about five minutes per device and thus increase the efficiency in your workshop.

### Work even more efficient in your workshop

You can define the download times of the XENTRY Update Service individually so that updates and software are only downloaded at night outside of workshop operation, for example. This reduces waiting times when using the diagnostic systems.

If you use several diagnostic systems, the same software and updates do not have to be downloaded several times from each diagnostic system individually, but only once to the Retail Data Storage, which then supplies the various networked diagnostic systems.

### XENTRY Update Service without Retail Data Storage

The XENTRY Update Service can also be used without Retail Data Storage, but it has some disadvantages:

* Multiple download of data required, as each diagnostic device must download it separately
* High download volume from the Internet
* Longer waiting times in workshop operation, depending on download duration

We therefore only recommend the "XENTRY Update Service without Retail Data Storage" variant if you use 1-2 diagnostic systems per operation and use them only irregularly.

[HelpCard Retail Data Storage 2](https://b2bcfrontdoor.azurefd.net/prod/media/imwnvmfv/retail-data-storage-2-helpcard-enu.pdf)

### Technical requirement

| **Internet connection:**An Internet connection with at least 100 Mbit/s (lower bandwidths may result in longer download times) and a maximum latency of 60 ms.**Activation Domains and Ports:**The Retail Data Storage must be able to reach the following domains and ports on the Internet:Domains:\*.mercedes-benz.com\*.corpinter.net\*.tbinter.net\*.akamaihd.netPorts:80 (http)443 (https)**If you use a XENTRY Diagnosis Kit:**The XENTRY Diagnosis Pad | Pad 2 systems must be able to reach the following connections to the Retail Data Storage:Ports:80 (http)443 (https)9000 (http)7001 (tcp)7002 (tcp)Any proxy server used must support the HTTP version 1.1 (range requests).In the firewall, the domains and ports must be enabled for XENTRY Portal, XENTRY Diagnosis Pad and Retail Data Storage. If not all domains are enabled, support can only be provided to a limited extent or not at all, because support packages cannot be transmitted for example. Furthermore, breaking SSL connections is not allowed. As a result, online services including the XENTRY Update Service, cannot be used.**Hint:** The activation on IP addresses or IP ranges is not recommended due to the use of content delivery networks! |

The purchase of the Retail Data Storage 2 already includes the XENTRY Update Service for 42 months from the activation date. The customer who has completed the purchase of the Retail Data Storage will receive an e-mail notification before the 42 months expire about the end of the 42 months. If the customer wishes to continue using the data supply via the XENTRY Update Service in combination with an Retail Data Storage, he has the option of either purchasing an extension of the XENTRY Update Service for 12 months, or purchasing a new Retail Data Storage. The activation date can be read out within the XENTRY Update Service Control Center (Retail Data Storage), both in the Monitoring area and in the Administration area, here in the tab "About the Device".

### Disposal

Because the Retail Data Storage is a purchased product, you do not need to return it at the end of its use. From Mercedes-Benz there are no specifications and requirements for the disposal of a Retail Data Storage. Please dispose your old Retail Data Storage in accordance with the legal requirements in your country.

### Control unit programming with the USB to LAN Adapter

The size of the control unit software increases with new vehicle models. Workshops therefore need longer to transfer control unit software via OBD to the vehicle. The data transfer rate via OBD is limited to 100 Mbit/s. Control unit software can now optionally be transferred to the vehicle via USB to LAN Adapter at 300 Mbit/s.

### General information / application

As from XENTRY Diagnosis release 12/2023, it is recommended to transfer the control unit software to the vehicle via USB to LAN Adapter when performing control unit programming of the head unit BR214 and BR236. Transfer via OBD is also still available. However, transfer using both options at the same time is not possible – you have to choose one of the two transfer options.

The diagram below shows what the control unit programming path via OBD and via USB to LAN Adapter looks like.

![the control unit programming path via OBD and via USB to LAN Adapter](https://b2bcfrontdoor.azurefd.net/prod/media/naab1xo1/control-unit-programming-path.png?rmode=max&width=739&height=380)

When performing programming via OBD (left side in the diagram), control of the programming as well as transfer of the control unit software takes place via the XENTRY Diagnosis device, the VCI, and OBD.

When programming via the USB to LAN Adapter (right side of the diagram), control of the programming is still performed via the XENTRY Diagnosis Device, the VCI, and OBD, while the control unit software is transferred from the Retail Data Storage directly to the vehicle control unit via the LAN port of the workshop network at the diagnosis workstation, a LAN cable, a USB to LAN Adapter, and the USB-C port in the center console of the vehicle.

Programming via the USB to LAN Adapter offers the following advantages:

* The USB to LAN Adapter enables 3x faster data transfer (300 Mbit/s instead of 100 Mbit/s), which shortens waiting times during control unit programming. An example scenario can be found [here](https://b2bcfrontdoor.azurefd.net/prod/media/dqmelfwc/usb-to-lan-adapter-zeitersparnis-enu.png "USB To LAN Adapter Zeitersparnis ENU").
* Very stable connection as data transfer from Retail Data Storage to the vehicle via the USB to LAN Adapter is completely cabled.

### Requirements

The workshop network must meet several requirements to be able to use the USB to LAN Adapter and achieve the full data transfer rate of 300 Mbit/s:

* A Retail Data Storage that is located in the same network as the USB to LAN adapter, LAN port and the XENTRY diagnostic device.
* The USB to LAN adapter and the Retail Data Storage should preferably be located in the same subnet (Class-C subnet). When using different subnets, there may be restrictions in the use of the USB to LAN adapter with older head unit software. Then follow the instructions in XENTRY Diagnosis.
* A LAN cable with at least Cat5e, i.e. 1 Gbit/s and 100 MHz
  (Cat5 (10/100 Mbit/s and 100 MHz) is not sufficient).
* A device with up-to-date XENTRY Diagnosis Software installed.
* A compatible VCI with up-to-date firmware.
* Compatible model series: 214 (E-Class) and 236 (CLE-Class). Additional model series will follow later.
* Compatible control unit: Head unit (in XENTRY Diagnosis: A26/17 - MBUX multimedia system + instrument cluster)
* Connection of the diagnostic device with the vehicle via VCI and OBD as a diagnostic device connected with OBD is still required for control of the programming.

XENTRY Retail Data Storage is affected by denial of service (DoS). To exploit the vulnerability, the unauthorized author must be on the same network as the Retail Data Storage and send commands to restart the device through the api which does not validate the authorization.

![]()

When performing an authenticated test on Retail Data Storage, I could see that the ‘About the device’ tab has some functions available for storage management. One of these functions is the restart option, although the function is only available on the authenticated screen, it is possible to send a request through the API for the storage to be restarted, as the API does not validate authorization, allowing anyone, as long as is on the same network as the storage, can restart the device unrestrictedly.

![]()

Image 1 — Restart function on authenticated screen.

When intercepting the restart request, it is possible to notice that a request is sent via API and that there is no Authorization header or that uses some type of authentication to validate the authorization to perform this type of action. It is possible to notice that the result of the request is 200 OK, which indicates that the action was performed successfully.

![]()

Image 2 — The 200 OK indicates that the action was performed successfully.

Analyzing the activity responses through ping, it is possible to notice that the device stops responding to requests for a certain period and then returns to respond, which indicates that it was unavailable for a period (restarting).

![]()

Image 3 — Device stopping responding for a time interval.

The impact of this vulnerability is the interruption of the operation, since this attack can be enhanced and performed intermittently, effectively generating a denial of service.

> *The device’s IP address was censored due to belonging to a real scenario and in production, even if it is a local address, for security reasons I decided to preserve it.*
