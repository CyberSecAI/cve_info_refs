- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Extensions For CF7 WordPress plugin versions 2.0.8 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into making a malicious request through a link or other method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and have the victim execute it while they are authenticated to the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication.
