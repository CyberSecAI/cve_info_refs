The provided content is related to CVE-2023-23315.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of an SQL parameter within the `stripejsValidationModuleFrontController::initContent()` method of the Stripe Payment Pro (SCA-ready) module (aka stripejs) for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `payment_intent` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Technical and personal data leaks
- Potential for gaining admin access
- Ability to remove all data from the linked PrestaShop
- Displaying sensitive tables in the front-office, potentially exposing admin ajax scripts and tokens.
- Deployment of webskimmers to steal credit card data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network (HTTP POST request)
- Exploitable via a trivial HTTP call

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges are required, and there is no user interaction needed.
- The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated.
- Attackers can conceal the module controllerâ€™s path during the exploit, making it difficult to identify in conventional frontend logs.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `payment_intent` parameter.
