- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website, which would then be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts, likely through the plugin's shortcode functionality or other input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious actor needs to be able to inject malicious script. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor", suggesting the attacker needs at least contributor access to inject the scripts.
