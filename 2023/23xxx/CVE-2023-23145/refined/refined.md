{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `lsr_read_rare_full` function within the `src/laser/lsr_dec.c` file of the GPAC multimedia framework. The code uses `gf_malloc` to allocate memory for `da->array.vals` and `da->array.units` based on a read value `da->array.count`, and then immediately reallocates this memory using `gf_realloc`. The realloc should not have been necessary on this instance.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unnecessary memory reallocation using `gf_realloc` immediately after allocation with `gf_malloc`."
    ],
    "impact": "The immediate reallocation has no benefit on the specific memory use, but can lead to memory corruption and potential denial-of-service, if the realloc fails due to memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input file that causes the `lsr_read_rare_full` function to be called with a large value for `da->array.count`, leading to the unnecessary realloc attempt and potential memory issues.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to be processed by the GPAC framework. No further capabilities are mentioned."
