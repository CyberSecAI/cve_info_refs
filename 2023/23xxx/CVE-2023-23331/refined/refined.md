Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection flaw. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `dt_insert` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** It's a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the results of their queries in the application's responses, but can infer information based on time delays.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can extract, add, modify, or delete data from the backend database.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker can use the SQL injection to gain command execution on the backend database server (using `os-shell` in `sqlmap`). This can potentially allow for full system compromise
*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With command execution, the attacker can take complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through the HTTP `dt_insert` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Tools:** The attacker needs tools such as Burp Suite (for intercepting requests) and sqlmap (for automating SQL injection exploitation).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** Amano Xoffice parking solutions.
*   **Affected Version:** 7.1 (7.1.3879).
*   **Exploitation Method:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting a payload such as `PG_SLEEP(5)` into the `dt_insert` parameter. The time delay indicates the successful execution of the injected SQL code and confirms the presence of the vulnerability.
*  The `sqlmap` tool is used to automate the exploitation process, identify the database type and operating system.
