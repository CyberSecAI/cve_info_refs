Package        : intel-microcode
Version        : 3.20231114.1~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-23583
Debian Bug     : 1055962

Benoit Morgan, Paul Grosen, Thais Moreira Hamasaki, Ke Sun, Alyssa
Milburn, Hisham Shafi, Nir Shlomovich, Tavis Ormandy, Daniel Moghimi,
Josh Eads, Salman Qazi, Alexandra Sandulescu, Andy Nguyen, Eduardo Vela,
Doug Kwan, and Kostik Shtoyk discovered that some Intel processors
mishandle repeated sequences of instructions leading to unexpected
behavior, which may result in privilege escalation, information
disclosure or denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
3.20231114.1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.

For the detailed security status of intel-microcode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/intel-microcode>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Subject: CVE-2023-23583: Intel - Denial of Service - Privilege Escalation
 (Reptar)

Name of the issue: Redundant Prefix Issue

Description of the issue
Under certain microarchitectural conditions, Intel has identified cases
where execution of an instruction (REP MOVSB) encoded with a redundant
REX prefix may result in unpredictable system behavior resulting in a
system crash/hang, or, in some limited scenarios, may allow escalation
of privilege from CPL3 to CPL0.
This Redundant Prefix Issue is assigned CVE-2023-23583 with a CVSS Base
Score of 8.8 High CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Mitigation
Intel is providing a microcode update to mitigate this issue: <https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/releases/tag/microcode-20231114>

I think that link should point to

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/redundant-prefix-issue.html>

This one can be found in the affected processors table.

Does this also allow privilege escalation from a VM guest to the host?
What are the limited scenarios?

Thank you, Antonio!

Here's a writeup and reproducer tool by Tavis Ormandy:

<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/reptar.html>

The GitHub release page above links to Intel security advisory:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00950.html>

which specifies what CPU generations are affected (from 10th generation
Intel Core or 3rd generation Xeon Scalable to current), and links to a
table with "an exhaustive list of processors" matched against this issue
and previously disclosed issues:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html>

It also says "Please refer to the technical paper here for additional
information", where "here" is a link supposedly to "the technical
paper", but it's a non-existent page currently, so I'm not posting the
URL yet (not sure if it'll stay the same when the page is published).

Meanwhile, Tavis' writeup is great!

Alexander

Per Tavis' writeup, this at least allows a VM guest to trigger machine
check exceptions and halt the host.  So it's at least a DoS.  My reading
is this can cause wrong control flow at least in SMT sibling threads, so
is a privilege escalation risk from VMs at least when SMT is enabled.
Without SMT, it's still at least a DoS.

I would like to know this, too.  I doubt it's been fully researched.

Package        : intel-microcode
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-23583
Debian Bug     : 1055962

Benoit Morgan, Paul Grosen, Thais Moreira Hamasaki, Ke Sun, Alyssa
Milburn, Hisham Shafi, Nir Shlomovich, avis Ormandy, Daniel Moghimi,
Josh Eads, Salman Qazi, Alexandra Sandulescu, Andy Nguyen, Eduardo Vela,
Doug Kwan, and Kostik Shtoyk discovered that some Intel processors
mishandle repeated sequences of instructions leading to unexpected
behavior, which may result in privilege escalation, information
disclosure or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.20231114.1~deb11u1.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20231114.1~deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.

For the detailed security status of intel-microcode please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/intel-microcode>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
