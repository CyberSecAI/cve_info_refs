PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix is a high productivity app platform that enables you to build and continuously improve mobile and
web applications at scale. The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across
your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operations.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-23835

Some of the Mendix runtime API’s allow attackers to bypass XPath constraints and retrieve information
using XPath queries that trigger errors.
