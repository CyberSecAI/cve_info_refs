- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An improper access control vulnerability exists in Mendix applications that allows attackers to bypass XPath constraints. This is triggered via XPath queries that cause errors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Access Control (CWE-284) due to insufficient validation or enforcement of XPath constraints.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can bypass XPath constraints and retrieve information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks are possible using specially crafted XPath queries that trigger errors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests with XPath queries to the application. No special user privileges are required (PR:N), but the attack is considered to have a high level of effort to be carried out (AC:H).
