Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-23603:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox's `console.log()` function processes style directives using the `%c` format specifier. Regular expressions intended to filter out forbidden properties and values from these style directives were not properly accounting for external URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient sanitization of style directives passed to `console.log` with the `%c` format specifier.
- Regular expression filtering is inadequate and can be bypassed to include external URLs.
- The vulnerability allows bypassing the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the page where `console.log` is called, by loading external resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration from the browser by loading external resources.
- Potential for exfiltrating sensitive information.
- Bypassing of CSP, a key browser security mechanism.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious website or script can utilize the `console.log()` function with a crafted style directive and `%c` specifier.
- This crafted directive includes an external URL for background images or other CSS properties.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable browser (e.g., a malicious website).
- Knowledge of how to craft malicious style directives for `console.log()`
