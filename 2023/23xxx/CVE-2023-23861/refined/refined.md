- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GMAce WordPress plugin, in versions 1.5.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or actions on the affected WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email containing a request that, when accessed by an authenticated user, triggers an unintended action within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into accessing the malicious content or link to exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this if they can get a privileged user to perform an action.
