The vulnerability can be exploited by threat actors to perform further attacks.

At Zoho, keeping customer information safe and secure is our number one priority

Zoho offers this Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) to continuously improve the security of our products. If you believe you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in any of Zoho's products or assets, let us know immediately, and we will make every effort to get the issues addressed as quickly as possible.

Please ensure you understand the program rules before you report a vulnerability. By participating in this program, you agree to be bound by these rules. Zoho provides monetary rewards to vulnerability reporters at its discretion and the reward may vary based upon metrics including (but not limited to) vulnerability severity, impact, and exploitability.

You can share details of the suspected vulnerability with Zoho by clicking below;

Submit Bug

Terms

These Bug Bounty Terms and Conditions ("Bug Bounty Terms") govern your participation in the Zoho Bug Bounty Program ("Bug Bounty Program") and are a legally binding contract between you or the company you represent and Zoho. By submitting a vulnerability or participating in the program, you agree to be bound by the Terms.

Bug Bounty Program

The Bug Bounty Program enables you to submit security bugs or vulnerabilities discovered by you in eligible Zoho Services and earn rewards for your submissions. Service-specific terms of use that are applicable to specific Zoho Services ("Service-Specific Terms") shall be applicable to you in addition to the Bug Bounty Terms. In the event of a conflict between Bug Bounty Terms and Service-specific Terms, the Bug Bounty Terms shall prevail.

Bug Bounty Program Eligibility

Participation in the Bug Bounty Program is open to all individuals unless:

* You are below 14 years of age. If you are 14 years old or above, but you are considered a minor in your place of residence, you must obtain your parent's or legal guardian's permission prior to your participation in the Bug Bounty Program after having read the Bug Bounty Terms;
* You are a resident of any US sanctioned countries;
* You are currently an employee of Zoho or you were employed by Zoho within six (6) months prior to your participation in the Bug Bounty Program; or
* You are a family member of a Zoho employee.

Responsible Research and Disclosure

You will follow the rules specified hereunder, failing which your participation in the Bug Bounty Program will be immediately terminated.

* You will make all efforts to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, degradation of Zoho Services, disruptions to Zoho's infrastructure and systems, and destruction of both Zoho's and users' data in the course of your security bug research.
* You will report any security bug discovered by you ("Security Bug") to Zoho and provide Zoho with reasonable time to identify and mitigate the security bug before publicly disclosing it to others.
* During your security bug research, if you have any inadvertent access to Zoho's or users' information, including sensitive, personal, or any other unauthorized information ("Unauthorized Information"), you must cease your Security Bug research to prevent further access to any Unauthorized Information by you and notify Zoho of any Unauthorized Information you accessed. Upon notifying Zoho of such access, delete all Unauthorized Information from your systems or devices.
* You will always use your account, or an account for which you have explicit consent from the account owner, for testing the Security Bug.
* You will use any security bug discovered by you only for testing, and you will not exploit the Security Bug in any manner.
* You are prohibited from performing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) testing or any activities that could potentially lead to service degradation, disruption, or outage. Engaging in such actions constitutes a violation of our program policy and may result in legal consequences.

Submission of Bugs

If you have discovered an eligible security bug as specified in the [scope](#scope), you may submit the bug through the website provided to you for submission.

Your submission shall include details such as vulnerability description, clear reproduction steps, and a proof-of-concept.

Review of Submission

Upon receipt of your submission, Zoho will review and validate the submission within three (3) days from the date of your submission and will prioritize based on the severity of the vulnerability submitted and resolve the vulnerability accordingly. Zoho will notify you once the vulnerability is resolved and you may confirm whether the remedy resolves the vulnerability. If there is more than one submission for the same vulnerability from different parties, bounty will be paid to the first submission.

Bounty Payment and Procedure

Zoho will pay a reward for your eligible submissions ("Bounty"). Bounties will be determined and granted only at Zoho's discretion. You can find the reward tiers [here](#bountyinfo).

Zoho will fulfill the Bounty payments through the following payment modes:

* For Indian participants, in INR through wire transfer;
* For participants from outside India, in USD through PayPal; or
* As an Amazon gift card in USD.

You understand that you are responsible for paying the taxes associated with Bounty payments. Bounties for Indian participants will be paid only after deducting TDS of 10% (Tax Deducted at Source).

Bounties shall be claimed by you within a period of three (3) months from the date of your entitlement to the reward.

Ownership of Submission

You grant Zoho non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, and royalty-free license to review, assess, and use your submission to analyze and resolve the vulnerability submitted by you and for other related purposes.

Limitation of Liability

ZOHO SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER OR FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER FAILURE, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF THE BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM.
