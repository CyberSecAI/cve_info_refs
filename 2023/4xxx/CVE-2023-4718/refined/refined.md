- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'fa' and 'fa-stack' shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's browser session and/or the site.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code within the attributes of the 'fa' and 'fa-stack' shortcodes
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher can exploit this vulnerability.
