- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing nonce validation on the `process_change_profile_form` function in the Realia plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can change a user's email address if they can trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors**: A forged request initiated by the attacker. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link to trigger the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link or form. The victim must be a logged-in administrator.
