## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Posts Ticker < 1.1.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Add a post with the shortcode:
`[spt-posts-ticker label\_text\_size='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"' label\_text="123123"]`
View the shortcode and move your mouse over the string `123123` to see the XSS.
