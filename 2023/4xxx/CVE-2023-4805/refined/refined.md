Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tutor LMS plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields within the user profile settings. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to store malicious scripts within the plugin's database through the vulnerable input fields. This script is then executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Account takeover
    - Data theft
    - Website defacement
    - Malicious redirects

**Attack vectors:**
- User input: The vulnerability is triggered by submitting malicious code through the "First Name" or "Last Name" fields in the user profile settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Subscriber or higher access: An attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site to access the user profile settings page.
- Ability to submit form data: The attacker needs to be able to submit data via the profile update form.
