## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tutor LMS < 2.3.0 - Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow users such as subscriber to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Register a student account and go to the "Dashboard" plugin (https://example.com/dashboard/settings/)
2. Add the payload `&lt;svg/onload=alert(origin)&gt;` to either the "First Name" or "Last Name" fields.
3. Click on "Update Profile" and reload the page.
4. When you do that, you will see the XSS.

### Affects Plugins
