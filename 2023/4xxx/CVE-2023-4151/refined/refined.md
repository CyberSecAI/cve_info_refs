- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape an invalid nonce before outputting it in an AJAX response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a payload injected into the `asl-nounce` parameter, and then tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting that URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in admin user to visit that URL.
