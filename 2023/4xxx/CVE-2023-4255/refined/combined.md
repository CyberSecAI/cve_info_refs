Commit [419ca82](https://github.com/tats/w3m/commit/419ca82d57c72242817b55e2eaa4cdbf6916e7fa) (Fix m17n backspace handling causes out-of-bounds

write in checkType) introduced an incomplete fix.

In function checkType we store the length of the previous multi-char

character in a buffer plens\_buffer with pointer plens pointing to the

current position inside the buffer. When encountering a backspace plens

is set to the previous position without a bounds check. This will lead

to plens being out of bounds if we get more backspaces than we have

processed multi-char characters before.

If we are at the beginning of the buffer do not decrement and set plen

(the current length) to 0.

This also fixes GH Issue [#270](https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/270) [BUG] Out of bound read in Strnew\_size ,

Str.c:61

If the above explanation does sound weird it's because I didn't fully

grok that function. :-)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-38c2261ca0
2024-03-27 01:36:32.511401
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : w3m
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 0.5.3
Release : 63.git20230121.fc38
URL : <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : Pager with Web browsing abilities
Description :
The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used
as a text-mode Web browser. W3m features include the following: when
reading an HTML document, you can follow links and view images using
an external image viewer; its internet message mode determines the
type of document from the header; if the Content-Type field of the
document is text/html, the document is displayed as an HTML document;
you can change a URL description like '<http://hogege.net>' in plain
text into a link to that URL.
If you want to display the inline images on w3m, you need to install
w3m-img package as well.

Commit [419ca82](https://github.com/tats/w3m/commit/419ca82d57c72242817b55e2eaa4cdbf6916e7fa) (Fix m17n backspace handling causes out-of-bounds
write in checkType) introduced an incomplete fix.

In function checkType we store the length of the previous multi-char
character in a buffer plens_buffer with pointer plens pointing to the
current position inside the buffer. When encountering a backspace plens
is set to the previous position without a bounds check. This will lead
to plens being out of bounds if we get more backspaces than we have
processed multi-char characters before.

If we are at the beginning of the buffer do not decrement and set plen
(the current length) to 0.

This also fixes GH Issue [#270](https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/270) [BUG] Out of bound read in Strnew_size ,
Str.c:61

If the above explanation does sound weird it's because I didn't fully
grok that function. :-)

## Description

An out-of-bounds write issue has been discovered in the backspace handling of the checkType() function in etc.c within the W3M application. This vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specially crafted HTML file to the w3m binary. Exploitation of this flaw could lead to application crashes, resulting in a denial of service condition.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:

| Hi, I think the fix for [CVE-2022-38223](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rf3p-g68h-h93f) in [419ca82](https://github.com/tats/w3m/commit/419ca82d57c72242817b55e2eaa4cdbf6916e7fa) is not complete and it is still possible to trigger the same bug with a different poc in [tats/w3m#242](https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/242).

| From how I understand the code, plen is the length of the current (or previous?) character. In order to process backspace chars correctly over multi-char characters we store the length of each character in plens\_buffer. When reaching a backspace we pop the last length from the array. Now, if we get more backspace chars than we have characters processed the pointer will go out of bounds. Below is a fix which prevents the pointer from going out of bounds and setting plen to 0 when there is nothing left to process. This also fixes [BUG] Out of bound read in Strnew\_size , Str.c:61 [#270](https://github.com/tats/w3m/issues/270) diff --git a/etc.c b/etc.c index 128717b1..efcfab92 100644 --- a/etc.c +++ b/etc.c @@ -393,7 +393,8 @@ checkType(Str s, Lineprop \*\*oprop, Linecolor \*\*ocolor) if (color) color -= plen; #endif - plen = \*(--plens); + plens = plens == plens\_buffer ? plens : plens - 1; + plen = \*plens; str += 2; } } @@ -419,7 +420,8 @@ checkType(Str s, Lineprop \*\*oprop, Linecolor \*\*ocolor) if (color) color -= plen; #endif - plen = \*(--plens); + plens = plens == plens\_buffer ? plens : plens - 1; + plen = \*plens; str++; } #else |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-aeb75f8b5b
2024-03-23 00:20:56.402873
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : w3m
Product : Fedora 40
Version : 0.5.3
Release : 63.git20230121.fc40
URL : <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : Pager with Web browsing abilities
Description :
The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used
as a text-mode Web browser. W3m features include the following: when
reading an HTML document, you can follow links and view images using
an external image viewer; its internet message mode determines the
type of document from the header; if the Content-Type field of the
document is text/html, the document is displayed as an HTML document;
you can change a URL description like '<http://hogege.net>' in plain
text into a link to that URL.
If you want to display the inline images on w3m, you need to install
w3m-img package as well.

Strictly speaking, a pointer going out of bound (with one exception of 1 past the end) is already UB [1](#user-content-fn-0-07ab29b66a399be7deb0c066afbf30b3). Instead of trying to check for UB and then correcting it, it's better to check `plen` before subtracting.

```
if (prop - prop_buffer < plen) // would underflow
    prop = prop_buffer;
else
    prop -= plen;
```

Instead of trying to check for UB and then correcting it, it's better to check `plen` before subtracting. hm, I guess this is why I wrote [edc6026](https://github.com/tats/w3m/commit/edc602651c506aeeb60544b55534dd1722a340d3) as I did. :-D I even thought about this, but came to the wrong conclusion that it's fine as long as I don't dereference. Thanks for the review. I'm not happy with this whole function, but need to understand it better. Will update this commit in the coming days. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-3fc66f8bf3
2024-03-27 01:25:46.424178
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : w3m
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 0.5.3
Release : 63.git20230121.fc39
URL : <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : Pager with Web browsing abilities
Description :
The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used
as a text-mode Web browser. W3m features include the following: when
reading an HTML document, you can follow links and view images using
an external image viewer; its internet message mode determines the
type of document from the header; if the Content-Type field of the
document is text/html, the document is displayed as an HTML document;
you can change a URL description like '<http://hogege.net>' in plain
text into a link to that URL.
If you want to display the inline images on w3m, you need to install
w3m-img package as well.
