## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventON < 2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new events.
2. In the "Event Details", select "Online Event" for the "Event Attendance Mode".
3. Under "Virtual Event", select "This is a virtual (online) event" and then click on "Configure Virtual Event Details"
4. On the modal that pops up, enter the payload `'"><img src=X onerror=alert(1)>` for the Meeting URL.
5. Scroll down and click on the toggle "Disable redirecting and hiding virtual event link".
6. Save the changes and then publish the event.
7. View the event and see the XSS.
