Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the GitLab web UI's inability to handle directory paths containing line feed characters (`\n` or `%0a`). When such paths are introduced into a project's repository, it causes 500 errors when the UI tries to display commit details, merge request changes, or browse the affected directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The GitLab web UI doesn't properly sanitize or validate directory paths before processing them, allowing an attacker to inject line feed characters.
*   **Error Handling:** When encountering these malformed paths, the application throws 500 Internal Server Errors instead of gracefully handling the issue or providing user-friendly error messages.
*   **Backend Issues:** The backend also fails to handle these characters leading to Gitaly errors, `object not found` errors and `undefined method ‘lines’ for nil:NilClass` errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can disrupt regular workflows by making it impossible to view commit details, review merge requests, or browse project directories via the web UI.
*   **User Experience Degradation:** Users will encounter frequent 500 errors, making the web UI unusable for affected repositories/commits/branches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web UI Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious directory path containing line feed characters using the web UI's file creation feature and intercepts and modifies the POST request using a proxy tool like BurpSuite.
*   **Direct Git Manipulation (Potential):** Although not explicitly stated, a similar attack might be possible by directly manipulating the git repository through other methods, but this isn't the method described in this document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a valid GitLab account.
*   **Project Access:** The attacker needs "Developer" access to a project.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g. using Burp Suite) before they are sent to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The attacker does not need elevated privileges within the project.
*   The attack does not lead to data disclosure or integrity loss, it is primarily focused on service disruption.
*   The attacker can still review the commit changes locally using Git.
*   The vulnerability exists on GitLab.com as well as self-hosted instances.
