Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wp-piwik` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when handling the `wp-piwik` shortcode. This allows malicious code to be stored in the database.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately clean the shortcode attributes before using them in the iframe's `src` attribute.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly encode output, leading to the execution of injected scripts when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who visit pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerability could lead to session hijacking.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that redirect users to malicious websites for malware downloads.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information such as cookies or session tokens.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected script could deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can insert a malicious `wp-piwik` shortcode into a post or page. The attributes within the shortcode, particularly the URL used in the iframe, become the attack vector.
*   **Authenticated Users:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least contributor-level permissions to create or edit content, such as posts or pages.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `wp-piwik` shortcode.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically located within the `WP_Piwik/Widget/OptOut.php` file, particularly line 28, where the iframe `src` attribute is constructed without sanitizing the shortcode attributes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.29 of the plugin, which renames the plugin to "Connect Matomo".
*   The fix likely involves applying proper sanitization and escaping to the shortcode attributes before they are used in the iframe's `src` attribute.
*   The Wordfence article provides CVSS score and vector.
*   The patch was introduced in changeset [2969705](/changeset/2969705/wp-piwik).
