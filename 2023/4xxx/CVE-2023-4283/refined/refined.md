Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4283

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The EmbedPress plugin failed to properly sanitize user-provided attributes within the `embedpress_calendar` shortcode. This lack of sanitization allows malicious code to be injected. Additionally, output escaping was insufficient, allowing the injected scripts to execute.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize shortcode attributes provided by users.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of shortcode attributes, allowing injected scripts to be rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post. When a user views this page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- **Account Takeover:** If an admin views a page with malicious code, an attacker might be able to get admin access.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information like session cookies.
- **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts can modify the content of the website, defacing it.
- **Redirection:** Malicious scripts can be used to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:**  The vulnerability is triggered through the `embedpress_calendar` shortcode. An attacker would insert the shortcode with malicious attribute values into a page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level privileges in order to create/edit posts or pages.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Syntax:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `embedpress_calendar` shortcode and its attributes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in EmbedPress plugin versions up to and including 3.8.2.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.8.3.
- The provided Trac changeset ([2950211](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2950211/embedpress)) shows the code changes that were made to fix this vulnerability by adding output escaping and input sanitization.

This vulnerability allows for Stored XSS attacks, where the malicious script is stored on the server and executed whenever a user visits the affected page. This type of XSS can have a wide-ranging impact and is considered more severe than reflected XSS.
