- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of other users who access the WordPress administration panel. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. The injected code is stored in the database and executed when an admin visits the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin's settings.
