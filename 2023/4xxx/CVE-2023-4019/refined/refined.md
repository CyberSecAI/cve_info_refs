Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin "Media from FTP" lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with "author" level privileges (or higher) to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators. Specifically, the plugin allows moving files by manipulating the `new_url` parameter of the `mediafromftp-update-ajax-action` AJAX request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary issue is the insufficient access control. The plugin initially used the `manage_options` capability, which is intended for administrators. Although this was improved, it was still insufficient in multi-site setups. The plugin should restrict file operations to administrative users, not authors.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability can be exploited by using path traversal sequences like `/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` in the `new_url` parameter. This allows unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `new_url` parameter, potentially including sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.
    *  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, gaining access to wp-config.php could lead to RCE. This can be done by retrieving database credentials and establishing a connection to the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
    *   **`new_url` Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is manipulation of the `new_url` parameter in the AJAX request. This parameter is used to specify the location of the new file, but it does not properly validate the path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least "author" level privileges.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** Attacker needs to know about `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mediafromftp-search-register` to initiate the process.
    *  **Ability to intercept HTTP requests:** Attacker must be able to intercept the HTTP request and modify it.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is classified as "INCORRECT AUTHORISATION"
* The associated OWASP category is "A5: Broken Access Control."
* The associated CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)
* The CVSS score is 9.1 (critical)
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 11.17 of the plugin.
