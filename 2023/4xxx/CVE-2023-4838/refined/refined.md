Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `[sdc_count]` shortcode in the Simple Download Counter plugin. Specifically, the `before` and `after` attributes were not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the `before` and `after` attributes of the shortcode. This injected script is then stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the page containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of attacker-supplied JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the affected page.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could use this to potentially redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies/session data, modify website content, or even attempt to escalate privileges by stealing administrator credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript within the 'before' or 'after' attributes of the `[sdc_count]` shortcode. For example: `[sdc_count before='<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>' after='<img src=x onerror=alert(2)>']`
*   The vulnerable shortcode is present in the WordPress plugin 'Simple Download Counter'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor-level" permissions or higher. This allows them to create or edit content (pages or posts) and include the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Access to WordPress backend:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.1 of the plugin by using `htmlspecialchars()` to properly sanitize the `before` and `after` shortcode attributes.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn_) from VNPT-VCI.
*   The affected version is 1.6, and the patched version is 1.6.1.
