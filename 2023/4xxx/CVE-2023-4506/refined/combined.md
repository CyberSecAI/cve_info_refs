### Description

The Active Directory Integration / LDAP Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to LDAP Passback in versions up to, and including, 4.1.10. This is due to insufficient validation when changing the LDAP server. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative access and above, to change the LDAP server and retrieve the credentials for the original LDAP server.

# **TLDR**

I found two LDAP passback vulnerabilities on miniorange LDAP plugins.

# About miniorange plugins

The Staff/Employee Business Directory for Active Directory plugin is used to perform an LDAP search and display the Staff / Employees present in your Active Directory on a WordPress site using a shortcode. The users / staff / employee details will be fetched from the Active Directory dynamically. That means the users will not be created in WordPress, and neither will their information be stored. The plugin will seamlessly allow you to perform a Staff / Employee search through your business directory, employee directory, staff directory, or any other Active Directory implementations from your WordPress site and display the information you would like to see.

## Plugins affected

* Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites WordPress
* Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory

# Overview

Some time ago while learning some attack techniques related to Active Directory I discovered the concept of LDAP pass back and incorporated it into my testing repertoire.

About a month ago I found an asset inside a bugbounty program that made use of a Wordpress plugin to perform authentication over LDAP and I decided to install it to test if I found any exploitable vulnerability in the context of the program.

While the only thing that fell within the scope of it was an information disclosure, I found a number of extra vulnerabilities that could exploit an attacker as is the case of these two LDAP pass backs.

**What is LDAP Pass-Back?**

LDAP Pass-Back is an attack that exploits how some systems authenticate users to a directory service such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

Generally, even from the administration panel of devices that use LDAP for authentication is not possible to recover the password of the LDAP account used for authentication. This attack exploits the possibility of changing the host against which the device tries to authenticate by making it authenticate against a system controlled by the attacker, thus obtaining the credentials used by the application.

# PoC

**Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites Wordpress (CVE-2023–4506)**

Firstly this is the configuration panel accessible from the plugin interface, the entry point we are interested in this case is the one of the URL:

![]()

An attacker after accessing the service by any means could change this URL to a rogue LDAP server set up by him, where he could retrieve the credentials in plain text.

![]()

To setup it we can either set up an LDAP server from scratch on a VPS, or we can use this dockerized version that I uploaded a few months ago to GitHub (<https://github.com/pedrojosenavasperez/ldap-passback-docker>)
Once deployed on the server controlled by the attacker, we only have to test the connection with the button provided by the plugin, and we will see how the credentials in plain text reach the server controlled by the attacker.

![]()

**Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory (CVE-2023–4505)**

Quite similar to the previous one

![]()

An attacker after accessing the service by any means could change this URL to a rogue LDAP server set up by him, where he could retrieve the credentials in plain text.

![]()

When we hit “Test Connection”, we get the credentials in plain text in our rogue LDAP server.

![]()
# Solution

At this point miniorange has decided not to patch the vulnerability despite a long thread of communications with them explaining the problem and proposing solutions.

According to them, an attacker with access to WordPress should be able to access LDAP as well and the only mitigation they propose is to disable LDAP in favor of LDAPS on the network, which does not provide any protection against this attack.

#### Prerequisites

Active Directory Integration/LDAP Integration requires a few prerequisites before you can enable LDAP login for your WordPress sites.

I. Active Directory Integration/LDAP Integration requires a few `PHP Modules` to be enabled. Make sure these are enabled.

1. **PHP LDAP Module**:

   Step-1: Open the php.ini file.

   Step-2: Search for “extension=php\_ldap.dll” in the php.ini file. Uncomment this line, if not present then add this line to the file and save the file.
2. **OPENSSL Module**:

   Step-1: Open the php.ini file.

   Step-2: Search for “extension=php\_openssl.dll” in the php.ini file. Uncomment this line, if not present then add this line to the file and save the file.

II. To install Active Directory Integration/LDAP Integration the minimum requirements are:

1. **WordPress version 5.0**

2. **PHP version 5.2.0**

#### From your WordPress dashboard

1. Visit `Plugins > Add New`.
2. Search for `Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites`. Find and Install `Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites`.
3. Activate the plugin from your Plugins page.

#### From WordPress.org

1. Download Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites.
2. Unzip and upload the `ldap-login-for-intranet-sites` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites from your Plugins page.

#### Once Activated

1. Go to `Settings-> LDAP Login Config`, and follow the instructions.

## FAQ

### What is the LDAP/Active Directory Integration Login for Intranet Sites Plugin?

The LDAP/Active Directory Integration Login for Intranet Sites plugin allows users to authenticate on WordPress using Active Directory/LDAP credentials. It maps directory attributes to WordPress user-profiles and lets administrators assign WordPress roles to LDAP/Active Directory users, ensuring seamless integration.

### Which LDAP directories are supported?

The plugin supports a wide range of directories, including Microsoft Active Directory, Azure AD, Sun AD, OpenLDAP, JumpCloud, FreeIPA, Synology, OpenDS, and many more. This makes it highly versatile for various directory environments.

### What is role mapping in this plugin?

Role mapping assigns WordPress roles to LDAP/Active Directory users based on their group memberships or Organizational Units (OUs). This feature ensures users are automatically assigned proper roles after authentication based on their directory information.

### Does the plugin support Single Sign-On (SSO)?

Yes, the plugin supports Kerberos/NTLM Single Sign-On (SSO) for domain-joined machines, allowing users to log into WordPress seamlessly without needing to enter their credentials again, provided they are authenticated in Active Directory.

### What is the authentication report feature?

The authentication report logs failed login attempts from Active Directory/LDAP users, which can help identify potential security risks. Administrators can also export these reports in CSV format for further analysis or record-keeping.

### Can I authenticate users from multiple LDAP directories?

Yes, the premium version supports authentication from multiple LDAP directories and search bases. Administrators can configure multiple directories and set up sequential searches or domain membership-based authentication to support complex directory setups.

### Is the plugin compatible with multisite WordPress environments?

Yes, the premium version fully supports WordPress multisite environments, allowing administrators to configure LDAP/Active Directory login integration across multiple sites, and providing centralized authentication management for all subsites within a WordPress network.

### Are Active Directory passwords stored in the WordPress database?

No, we do not store Active Directory passwords in WordPress due to security reasons.

### How can Active Directory be used as an LDAP server?

Active Directory inherently supports LDAP as a directory service. To use Active Directory as an LDAP server, you can connect applications or systems using the LDAP protocol for tasks such as authentication, querying users or groups, and managing directory information. Ensure that the correct LDAP ports (usually 389 for standard LDAP or 636 for LDAP over SSL) are open and that your application is configured to communicate with AD using these protocols.

### Does the plugin provide profile mapping and group mapping features?

Yes, the plugin provides AD profile mapping as well as group mapping features that help in syncing user profiles as well as groups between LDAP/Active Directory and WordPress.
