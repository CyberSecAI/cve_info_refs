### Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2023-4471, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Order Tracking Pro WordPress plugin.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters in the plugin's export functionality.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

### Impact of exploitation
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user interacts with a crafted link, the attacker's script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Redirection to malicious sites

### Attack vectors
- An unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `start_date` or `end_date` parameters.
- The attacker must trick a user into clicking on the crafted link.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, and no authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link that they can convince a user to click on.

### Technical details
- The vulnerable code is located in `Export.class.php`. Specifically lines 158 and 160:
```php
<input type="date" name="start\_date" id="date-range-from" value="<?php echo isset( $_POST['start\_date'] ) ? esc_attr__( $_POST['start\_date'] ) : ''; ?>">
<input type="date" name="end\_date" id="date-range-to" value="<?php echo isset( $_POST['end\_date'] ) ? esc_attr__( $_POST['end\_date'] ) : ''; ?>">
```
Prior to the fix, the values were output using `echo $_POST['start_date']` and  `echo $_POST['end_date']`, without any sanitization or escaping. This allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML and Javascript code.
- The fix involves using `esc_attr__()` to properly sanitize and escape the output of the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.

### Additional information
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 3.3.6 of the Order Tracking Pro plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.3.7, which included changes to the escaping/sanitization for the export feature.
