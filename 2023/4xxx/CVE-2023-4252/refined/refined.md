Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The EventPrime plugin allows the price of a booking to be specified in the client's request rather than being securely determined server-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `ep_event_booking_total_price` parameter is directly controlled by the user.
*   **Price Manipulation:** The plugin accepts and processes the `ep_event_booking_total_price` parameter from the request without proper server-side validation or enforcement of the correct price.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassing Payment:** An attacker can purchase event bookings without paying the intended price by setting the `ep_event_booking_total_price` to 0 or another arbitrary low value.
*   **Loss of Revenue:** Event organizers using the vulnerable plugin may suffer financial losses due to unpaid bookings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `ep_event_booking_total_price` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user on the WordPress site.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate request parameters.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable endpoint is `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=ep_save_event_booking`.
* The vulnerable parameter is `ep_event_booking_total_price`.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.6 of the EventPrime plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided proof of concept code shows how to craft the malicious request using JavaScript in the browser console.
