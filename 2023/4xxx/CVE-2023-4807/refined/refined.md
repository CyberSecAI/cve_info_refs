    "cve": "CVE-2023-4807",
    "root_cause": "The POLY1305 MAC implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of non-volatile XMM registers"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). The most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.",
