### 3.4 RESEARCHER

​Reid Wightman of Dragos, Inc reported this vulnerability to Digi International.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

​Digi International recommends users acquire and install patches that they have made available for the following products:

* ​RealPort software for Windows: Fixed in 4.10.490
* ​Digi ConnectPort TS 8/16: Fixed in firmware version 2.26.2.4
* ​Digi ConnectPort LTS 8/16/32: Fixed in version 1.4.9
* ​Digi Connect ES: Fixed in firmware version 2.26.2.4

​For more information, see the [customer notification document](https://www.digi.com/getattachment/resources/security/alerts/realport-cves/Dragos-Disclosure-Statement.pdf) published by Digi International.

​Dragos recommends restricting access to Digi devices on TCP/771 (default) or TCP/1027 (if encryption is enabled, this is the default port). Only allow the workstations which initiate RealPort connections to communicate to the field equipment on those ports. Note that most of Digi's devices allow you to change the setting for which TCP port the RealPort service runs on, so end users should consult their device configuration and restrict access to the configured port if it is not the default.

​If using the system in 'reverse' mode, where the Digi device calls back to the Windows or Linux workstation, then Dragos recommends restricting access to the workstation on TCP/771 or TCP/1027 to known Digi RealPort devices on your network. This port may be configured by end users, so consult the workstation and device configurations to ensure coverage.

​CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

​CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

​Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

​Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

​​No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.

To: All Customers
From: Digi Security Team
Date: 08/25/2023
Subject: RealPort CVEs

This document includes vulnerability findings from a report that Dragos submitted. Below are
the CVEs that Dragos reported to us, Digi International. Listed below is a table of Digi
International products that were reported as vulnerable by Dragos.

Concern raised: CVE-2021-36767
Digi’s response: This CVE is not applicable to DAL devices running 21.11 or newer firmware. The
ConnectPort LTS is not vulnerable due to the device not supporting the challenge/response
authentication. Support is being added for this feature in the next release and will include the
same fix as other implementations. The ConnectPort TS 8/16 and Connect ES are vulnerable to
this CVE and will receive an update on August 30th with the release of NDS version 2.26.2.4.

Concern raised: CVE-2021-35977
Digi’s response: This vulnerability was fixed in Windows RealPort driver version 4.10.490.

Concern raised: CVE-2021-35979
Digi’s response: This vulnerability was fixed in Windows RealPort driver version 4.10.490.
Certificates for TLS connections are now pinned when the first encrypted connection is
established. The device must then present the same certificate on each subsequent connection,
or the connection will be rejected, and a message will be sent to the event log.

Concern raised: CVE-2023-4299
Digi’s response: The fix was to enforce an order where the device would not respond to a
challenge until the client successfully authenticates itself. This vulnerability was fixed in DAL
version 21.11 and later. The ConnectPort TS 8 MEI, ConnectPort TS 8/16, and Digi Connect ES
are vulnerable and will receive an update on August 30th with the release of NDS version
2.26.2.4.
