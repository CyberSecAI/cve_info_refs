- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `wcemails_edit` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute if a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link. This could lead to the attacker performing malicious actions in the context of the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious link containing the XSS payload in the `wcemails_edit` parameter, and tricks a user into clicking the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated attacker, needs to trick a user to click the malicious link.
