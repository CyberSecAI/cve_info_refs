- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application reflects everything after `/web/` in the URL without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks when a user visits the crafted URL.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code after `/web/` and tricking a user into clicking that link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on it. No special access or position is necessary other than having access to the web application.
