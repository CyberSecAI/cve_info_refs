## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP All Export (Free < 1.4.0, Pro < 1.8.6) - Admin+ RCE

### Description

The plugin does not validate and sanitise the `wp\_query` parameter which allows an attacker to run arbitrary command on the remote server

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "All Export" > "New Export"
2. Select "WP Query Results" as the export type
3. Enter the payload `phpinfo()` for the query.
4. Click customize and see the execution of `phpinfo()` when the page loads.
