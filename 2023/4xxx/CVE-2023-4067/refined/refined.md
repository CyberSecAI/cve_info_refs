Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4067

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `tab_date` and `tab_date_r` parameters in the "Bus Ticket Booking with Seat Reservation" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `tab_date` and `tab_date_r` GET parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user clicks a specially crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will execute within the user's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Defacement
    - Stealing of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely via HTTP requests.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to click a crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link with the vulnerable parameters and get the victim to click it.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 5.2.3 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.2.4 by sanitizing the `tab_date` and `tab_date_r` inputs using `sanitize_text_field`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vincenzo Turturro, Gianluca Parisi, and Vincenzo Cantatore.
