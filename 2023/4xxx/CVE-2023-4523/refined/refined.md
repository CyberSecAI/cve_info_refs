- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the Real Time Automation 460 Series products do not properly sanitize input from the URL string, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could run malicious JavaScript code. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malicious JavaScript content, resulting in a redirect to the index.htm main page of the gateway's HTTP interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the HTTP interface by injecting malicious JavaScript into the URL string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, and no specific privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N).
