Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Photospace Responsive plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient input sanitization and output escaping for the `psres_button_size` parameter. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are injected and then executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected pages.
- **Potential for Various Attacks:** This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Settings:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting the malicious payload into the `psres_button_size` parameter within the plugin's settings.
- **Affected Pages:** The injected script will execute on any page where the Photospace Responsive gallery is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WordPress site with at least administrator-level permissions. This is necessary to access and modify the plugin's settings.
- **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker needs the ability to navigate to the plugin settings page where the vulnerable parameter can be modified.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability specifically affects multi-site installations and installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.
- The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 2.1.1, and is patched in version 2.2.0.
- The provided code diffs show the changes made to address the sanitization issues.
- The fix includes input sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious scripts, which was not present in older versions of the code.
- It also includes output escaping with `esc_js()`

**Summary:**

The Photospace Responsive WordPress plugin contained a stored XSS vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization and output escaping in the `psres_button_size` parameter. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with administrator privileges to inject arbitrary web scripts, which will then be executed when other users visit affected pages. The fix addresses these shortcomings with improved sanitization and escaping.
