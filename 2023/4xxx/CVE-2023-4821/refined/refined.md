- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly filter potentially dangerous file extensions during the upload process, allowing an attacker to upload files containing malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient file extension filtering.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website by uploading specially crafted files (e.g., .shtml or .svg), which could lead to various impacts like session hijacking, defacement or further malicious actions on the compromised website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uploads malicious files through the file upload form on a product page of the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can upload the malicious files through the vulnerable form. They need to craft the malicious files and send a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint to trigger the vulnerability.
