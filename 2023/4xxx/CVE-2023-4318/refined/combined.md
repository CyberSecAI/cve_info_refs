## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Herd Effects < 5.2.4 - Effect Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF when deleting its items, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins delete arbitrary effects via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mwp-herd-effect&info=delete&did=1, this will make them delete the effect with ID 1
