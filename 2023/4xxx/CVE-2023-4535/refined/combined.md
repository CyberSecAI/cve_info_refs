## Description

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in OpenSC packages within the MyEID driver when handling symmetric key encryption. Exploiting this flaw requires an attacker to have physical access to the computer and a specially crafted USB device or smart card. This flaw allows the attacker to manipulate APDU responses and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromising the system's security.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

## Description

A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass. When a token/card is authenticated by one process, it can perform cryptographic operations in other processes when an empty zero-length pin is passed. This issue poses a security risk, particularly for OS logon/screen unlock and for small, permanently connected tokens to computers. Additionally, the token can internally track login status. This flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access, carry out malicious actions, or compromise the system without the user's awareness.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Thank you 👍 Looking on current rate of commits I think that best would be good to have one minor release per 3-4 months .. just to flush set of already committed fixes/improvements/updates. |

| I've updated <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/projects/12> with the missing pieces.  We still have some things to do regarding the fixed security issues. [@Jakuje](https://github.com/Jakuje), would it be possible for you to review and request possible CVEs with Red Hat's support (see the project's cards that are still *To Do*)? If needed, you may re-use some of the descriptive CVE text blocks for a possible security advisory in the wiki.  Unfortunately, we didn't make any progress regarding [signed OpenSC release packages](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/1129). I don't think we be able will finish [#2799](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/2799) for this release. macOS binaries are signed by Tim Wilbrink, but we didn't set up notarizion. Signed source code packages make sense with its git integration, which is still planned to be reviewed by [@Jakuje](https://github.com/Jakuje).  Thanks, [@xhanulik](https://github.com/xhanulik) , for providing a draft for the release notes. Please remember to synchronize this once project cards are *done* which are currently *in progress*. |

| Sorry for a delay. I can certainly put together some advisory drafts and ask for CVE numbers in coming week after I will go through the oss-fuzz issues and the auth bypass.  Regarding to the [#1129](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/1129) my take would be just to provide a signature on the final tarball using one of our PGP keys. But given the mess in which PGP is I am not using it on daily/weekly basis I was setting it up already several times (on yubikey) and I am not sure if it works right now or if it did not expire. Last time I did [sign libcacard](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/-/releases/v2.8.1). Would have to check. |

| I am attaching security advisories drafts. I would go ahead with two separate ones. One for the PIN bypass and the other for the oss-fuzz and coverity reported issues. Feel free to propose changes.  I just went ahead to test that the zero-length pin are indeed not able to exploit the screen unlock on Linux (with fresh install + new yubikey 5) and I was not able to get in.   ---  [CVE-2023-40660](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7635-x5f9-5458 "CVE-2023-40660"): Potential PIN bypass ([#2806](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/2806), [frankmorgner/OpenSCToken#50](https://github.com/frankmorgner/OpenSCToken/pull/50), [#2807](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/2807)) When the token/card was plugged into the computer and authenticated from one process, it could be used to provide cryptographic operations from different process when the empty, zero-length PIN and the token can track the login status using some of its internals. This is dangerous for OS logon/screen unlock and small tokens that are plugged permanently to the computer. The bypass was removed and OpenSC implemented explicit logout for most of the card drivers to prevent leaving unattended logged-in tokens.  The PoC is available for MacOS screen unlock bypass with Yubikey. The issue can be reproduced also with a PKCS#11 module and Minidriver if the calling applications does not bail out on empty pin (Neither Firefox nor SSSD allow empty PIN under Linux even before reaching out to the PKCS#11).  Affected versions: OpenSC 0.17.0 - 0.23.0  Originally reported by Deepanjan Pal (Oracle Corporation)  CVSS:3.0/[AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.0) (7.3) [CVE-2023-40661](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2c2j-2pgv-gfgc "CVE-2023-40661"): Static and dynamic analyzers reports This advisory summarizes automatically reported issues that are security relevant that were reported since the release of OpenSC 0.23.0.

| * CID 382262: Memory leak. Fixed with [739fa81](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/739fa81050989c3f85ca883ec76542b71cae7edc) Why this memory leak in SM is high? I would skip this one. * <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60971> Heap buffer overflow in the test code -- ignore  I agree to skip both of these issues.  As far as I can see, all of the issues from coverity and oss-fuzz can only be triggered by a specially crafted rogue smart card. Since this limits the attack vector for exploiting these problems, I think it is useful to mention this in the security advisory. (We could use some phrasing of one of our previous advisories on this kind of problems.) |

I tried to start from <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/OpenSC-security-advisories> but did not find any of them verbose and specific enough.

| Our naming scheme has been used for the past decades and we will not change this soon.  Yes and that that naming scheme has home issue for packagers which many maintainers simple ignores. Simple many package management software do not accept `-` in version string and `0.24.0-rc1` is not lower \*as version string) than `0.24.0`. Making something incorrectly very long time simple happens ..  PS. Latin "errare humanum est perseverare autem diabolicum". |

| I have tried this version with macOS Sonoma and it doesn't work either after doing a clean installation, while in another version of macOS or on windows it works perfectly. Will it be fixed in the future? Thanks |

| Preferably, we should support Sonoma with this release as well. It seems that 0.23.0 has problems with Sonoma, too ([#2887](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/2887)). My macbook air is too old, so I cannot reproduce this problem.  Maybe [@metsma](https://github.com/metsma) has more experience with Sonoma... |

| Maybe this helps, please let me know if this information is more helpful elsewhere  Like many people (apparently), I had big problems with OpenSC after upgrading to macOS Sonoma. I have noticed that the issues depend very much on hardware, so I tested a few readers. I don't know enough about all of this, I am a developer, but have no clue about this particular domain. I am using the SmartCard through Chrome to access Citrix and some VPN tunnel. Let me know how I can give you more info:  ✓ Identiv SCR3500 C Contact Reader: **Working** apparently without issues Product 0x581d, Vendor ID 0x04e6 (✓) ACR39U ICC Reader, **Working partially** (seemingly only once per connection), Product 0xb100, Vendor 0x072f ⤫ EMV SmartCard Reader **Not working** Product 0x9540 Vendor 0x058f ⤫ SCR3310 SmartCard Reader **Not Working** Product 0x5116 Vendor 0x04e6 |

| [@below](https://github.com/below) most of the people reported that the Sonoma issues got better after updating the CCID driver. See the issue [#2887](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/2887). The OpenSC does not implement any readers drivers and is using PCSC to do the talking with the HW so there is not much we can do from the OpenSC side. |

# OpenSC security advisories

Software often contains bugs, so does OpenSC. Be aware of the following security issues (in addition to overall [security considerations](Security-Considerations)) and upgrade to latest released version if needed.

* 05.09.2024 Heap buffer overflow issue has been identified in OpenSC driver for OpenPGP <CVE-2024-8443>
* 04.09.2024 Uninitialized memory issues have been identified in OpenSC
  + <CVE-2024-45615>: Usage of uninitialized values in libopensc and pkcs15init
  + <CVE-2024-45616>: Uninitialized values after incorrect check or usage of APDU response values in libopensc
  + <CVE-2024-45617>: Uninitialized values after incorrect or missing checking return values of functions in libopensc
  + <CVE-2024-45618>: Uninitialized values after incorrect or missing checking return values of functions in pkcs15init
  + <CVE-2024-45619>: Incorrect handling length of buffers or files in libopensc
  + <CVE-2024-45620>: Incorrect handling of the length of buffers or files in pkcs15init\*
* 13.02.2024 Heap use after free issue and vulnerability to Marvin attack have been identified in OpenSC
  + Side-channel leaks while stripping encryption PKCS#1.5 padding [CVE-2023-5992|](CVE-2023-5992)
  + Memory use after free in AuthentIC driver when updating token info <CVE-2024-1454>
* 25.09.2023 Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, mostly buffer overflows, but also potential PIN bypass.
  + The memory issues can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Coded as (<CVE-2023-40661> and <CVE-2023-4535>).
  + The potential PIN bypass can happen when card tracks its own login state, demonstrated with Yubikey's PIV applet <CVE-2023-40660>
* 20.10.2021 Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, including heap double free, use after free/return, and buffer overflows. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Coded as ([CVE-2021-42778](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-4277), [CVE-2021-42779](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42779), [CVE-2021-42780](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42780) and [CVE-2021-42781](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42782))
* 24.11.2020 Heap buffer overflows have been detected in the smart card drivers for oberthur, TCOS and Gemsafe GPK, which can be triggered by a specially crafted smart card during the initialization of OpenSC ([CVE-2020-26570](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26570), [CVE-2020-26571](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26571) and [CVE-2020-26572](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26572))
* [13.09.2018](https://sourceforge.net/p/opensc/mailman/message/36414448/) Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, ranging from stack based buffer overflows to out of bounds reads and writes on the heap. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Source: [X41-2018-002](https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2018-002-OpenSC/). Coded as [CVE-2018-16391](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16391), [CVE-2018-16392](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16392), [CVE-2018-16393](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16393), [CVE-2018-16418](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16418), [CVE-2018-16419](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16419), [CVE-2018-16420](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16420), [CVE-2018-16421](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16421), [CVE-2018-16422](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16422), [CVE-2018-16423g](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16423), [CVE-2018-16424](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16424), [CVE-2018-16425](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16425), [CVE-2018-16426](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16426) and [CVE-2018-16427](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-16427)
* 17.12.2010 A rogue smart card, specially crafted for this purpose, can be used to potentially execute arbitrary code if inserted to a local machine. Source: MWR InfoSecurity Advisory. Coded as [CVE-2010-4523](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-4523)

| I think all comments are covered now. In particulare, sc\_reset() is not called to logout the card.  If there are no other objections, I will merge this PR as is. |

If two processes are accessing a token, then one process may leave the card usable with an authenticated PIN so that a key may sign/decrypt any data. This is especially the case if the token does not support a way of resetting the authentication status (logout).

We have some tracking of the authentication status in software via PKCS#11, Minidriver (OS-wise) and CryptoTokenKit (OS-wise), which is why a PIN-prompt will appear even though the card may technically be unlocked as described in the above example. However, before this change, an empty PIN was not verified (likely yielding an error during PIN-verification), but it was just checked whether the PIN is authenticated. This defeats the purpose of the PIN verification, because an empty PIN is not the correct one. Especially during OS Logon, we don't want that kind of shortcut, but we want the user to verify the correct PIN (even though the token was left unattended and authentication at the computer).

This essentially reverts commit [e6f7373](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/e6f7373ef066cfab6e3162e8b5f692683db23864).

| To reproduce the problem, just do `pkcs11-tool --login` and then use the unlocked token with an empty PIN, e.g. in Firefox for client authentication. Even though Firefox requests the PIN, an empty PIN will be accepted. I used a Yubikey for testing, which currently doesn't support logout in OpenSC. |

| [@frankmorgner](https://github.com/frankmorgner) The use case where I needed to introduce [e6f7373](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/e6f7373ef066cfab6e3162e8b5f692683db23864) to get it working was such, that the system using the card via PKCS#11 needed to do several crypto-operations, after authenticating the PIN with a pin pad reader. If I remember correctly, only one process was involved. The PIN had to be authenticated only once. With a normal reader, enabling pin caching would allow this, but with a pin pad reader, the pin cannot be cached. Before [e6f7373](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/e6f7373ef066cfab6e3162e8b5f692683db23864) the user would be prompted for PIN for each operation, which would have been inconvenient and unacceptable from usability point of view. Even across several processes, it may be desired behavior to keep the PIN validated to log-on to several applications or web sites with single pin entry. You can always mark a specific key "user-consent" to ensure that the associated PIN is required for each use, if needed.  I agree it is a problem if an empty PIN from user input ends up here, and passes as validated. My commit was supposed to enable OpenSC to only internally check whether the PIN has been already authenticated. This should be in some way distinguished from user providing an empty PIN.  Unfortunately I think with this PR the problems I encountered with pinpad readers might come back. |

| Also note that several Yubikey PIV tokens have problems with login state. Grep for: `/* card_issues - bugs in PIV implementations requires special handling */` in card-piv.c. The grep for `CI_VERIFY_LC0_FAIL` to see what versions of yubikey have problem with testing login state. Other problems with these cards is selecting the wrong AID can reset the login state.  So the code is guessing if the login state for these devices.  PIV logout was added in NIST 800-73-4.  PIV-4-extensions i.e. [#2053](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/2053) the PIV PR for SM ( open for almost 3 year now) adds support for logout: <https://github.com/dengert/OpenSC/blob/PIV-4-extensions/src/libopensc/card-piv.c#L6133-L6139>  (I am still on vacation) |

| [@hhonkanen](https://github.com/hhonkanen) do you `disconnect = leave;` in opensc.conf? That was designed to allow card to stay logged in so multiple processes could use the card. even without pin caching. In my tests I used "leave" and pin caching off and certificate caching off. |

| It looks like I managed accidentally to reproduce this issue with my old yubikey, pkcs11 tool and chromium, but it is not that deterministic as I would like so I was not able to get a PKCS11 trace or something useful.  From short observation   * when I enter empty PIN in chromium, I do not see corresponding PKCS#11 call from NSS/chromium * Just using pkcs11-tool with `--login` does not issue C\_Login for zero-length input (which is sane, but something that we should not depend on). * If I modify the pkcs11-tool to send the zero-length pins, I am getting `CKR_PIN_LEN_RANGE` (makes sense -- there are lenght limits for PINs but did not check if before this change or after). * I believe the calling application would have to send the empty Login and ignore its results which is already two NO-NO. But even after modifying the pkcs11 too to do so I am still getting the objects listing without private keys and the attempts to sign leads to the "private key not found" errors so I assume there must be some missing piece to make this working with the pkcs11 (if even possible).   I think it will require some more investigation. Tracking the login state only in the software is also not ideal as then we move the responsibility from hardware to software. Using proper logout procedure should be preferred (even though it might not be always safe as the processes might crash before this is called). |

| [@dengert](https://github.com/dengert) thanks for reminding me about disconnect = leave setting. I do not know if it would help in the pinpad use case. It's been a while since [e6f7373](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/e6f7373ef066cfab6e3162e8b5f692683db23864), so other things which affect it may have changed in-between.  I don't have a pinpad reader with me now, and cannot get one from anywhere soon, as I'll not be working at the office before August. I remember the problem was, that OpenSC decided it needs to authenticate the PIN again withing a single PKCS#11 session, and prompted user for PIN on the pinpad between PKCS#11 operations, and I could fix it this way. I have a feeling it may still be necessary to check the pin authentication state, if it is not checked somewhere else. But we should in some way distinguish this from providing a zero-length PIN externally.  Could anybody test doing several PKCS#11 operations (like C\_Sign / C\_Decrypt / C\_Wrap / C\_UnWrap) using a pinpad reader? |

AFAIK that would be the application decision to issue the C\_Login() itself.

I have a feeling it may still be necessary to check the pin authentication state, if it is not checked somewhere else.

Could anybody test doing several PKCS#11 operations (like C\_Sign / C\_Decrypt / C\_Wrap / C\_UnWrap) using a pinpad reader?  I have some HP pinpad reader (and MyEID cards) I can test, but I would probably need some more information on the configuration and steps you used. |

| AFAIK the zero-length pin is provided by the software every time when there is a pinpad reader.  I just remember that I got into sc\_pkcs15\_verify\_pin with zero length PIN between operations, without calling C\_Login again in the calling software.  I have some HP pinpad reader (and MyEID cards) I can test, but I would probably need some more information on the configuration and steps you used.  Here is a test program: <https://github.com/hhonkanen/WrapTest>  To run it, you have to prepare a MyEID card with an RSA key. By default, it logins with PIN with value "1111" and so-pin with value "12345678". You can modify it to use pinpad. It's been a while since I have run it last time, some more preparations might be needed. The test program also verifies that always\_authenticate works for a Generic Secret key being wrapped in the end, but I think it is not related to this issue. |

| All cards supporting the query for PIN\_INFO should be affected, i.e CAC1, PIV, Coolkey, SC-HSM, gemsafeV1, nqApplet, StarCOS, IASECC, CardOS, MyEid, IDPrime, skeid, CAC, OpenPGP.  `disconnect_action=reset` could solve the issue sometimes, but that is neither the default configuration, nor does it cover all of the problems with the PIN bypass. Consequently, we should not rely on this for solving the PIN issue.  Yes, you could check for `pinlen==0` in the application (which was my first try of solving [frankmorgner/OpenSCToken#50](https://github.com/frankmorgner/OpenSCToken/pull/50) and which is what [`pkcs11-tool` does](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/blob/83c468d33726a9db422f0f9013fa8c6c86bad82f/src/tools/pkcs11-tool.c#L1842-L1845)), but as stated above, Firefox does not prevent the use of C\_Login with an empty PIN and the same is true for macOS logon/screen saver (via CTK).  In PKCS#11 we are terminating session with sc\_logout, which means the above cards are not affected if (a) the card driver implements logout *and* (b) the process authenticating the card has terminated. That's why I suggested to use pkcs11-tool and a PIV card for reproducing the issue. |

Maybe prompted by something in opensc, but that should not be the case unless there was "always\_authenticate" attribute or some more complex auth scheme (did not look how the 4 pins were used in the original issue.  I believe that is correct.  PKCS11-base-V3.0-os says:  ``` 3198 CKF_PROTECTED_AUTHENTICATION_PATH flag in its CK_TOKEN_INFO being set, then that means 3199 that there is some way for a user to be authenticated to the token without having to send a PIN through 3200 the Cryptoki library. One such possibility is that the user enters a PIN on a PIN pad on the token itself, or 3201 on the slot device. Or the user might not even use a PIN—authentication could be achieved by some 3202 fingerprint-reading device, for example. To log into a token with a protected authentication path, the pPin 3203 parameter to C_Login should be NULL_PTR. When C_Login returns, whatever authentication method  3204 supported by the token will have been performed; a return value of CKR_OK means that the user was  3205 successfully authenticated, and a return value of CKR_PIN_INCORRECT means that the user was  3206 denied access.   ```  Some thing to check: OpenSC is not setting CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH when PIN PAD reader is detected.  The application may not check for CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH and issue prompt for a PIN.  In the above cases user may know there is a pin pad reader and does not know what else to do but send zero length PIN.  OpenSC may in some places assume zero length pin means: PIN PAD reader is usable or no PIN is needed i.e. use existing login state or a zero length is valid for the device.  If its an application issue do we need some `opensc.conf` option to accommodate a bad application?  Do we say if CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH is set and C\_Login is called with a zero length PIN we treat it as if C\_Login was called with NULL\_PTR?  If CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH is not set, then a zero length pin is and error? The Verify APDU with a zero length pin may be handled by card is strange ways. AFAIK most card enforce some minimal length for a PIN.  (I like the last two.) |

I am ok with this change, but I still need to get back to the investigating the issue with the pinpad reader. I will not get back to that earlier than next week but this change should not be blocked on this. If we will need to figure out some other solution for pinpad readers, it can land in separate issue/pr.

| OpenSC is not setting CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH when PIN PAD reader is detected.  I think it is?   [OpenSC/src/pkcs11/framework-pkcs15.c](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/blob/f1993dc4e0b33050b8f72a3558ee88b24c4063b2/src/pkcs11/framework-pkcs15.c#L1145)  Line 1145 in [f1993dc](/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/f1993dc4e0b33050b8f72a3558ee88b24c4063b2)   |  | slot->token\_info.flags |= CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH; | | --- | --- |      The application may not check for CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH and issue prompt for a PIN.  Yes  If its an application issue do we need some opensc.conf option to accommodate a bad application?  Yes  Do we say if CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH is set and C\_Login is called with a zero length PIN we treat it as if C\_Login was called with NULL\_PTR?  The zero length PIN is (was) for the cases where the misbehaving application calls C\_Login after a PIN prompt even if CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH is set and should be called with NULL.  If CKF\_PROTECTED\_AUTHENTICATION\_PATH is not set, then a zero length pin is and error? The Verify APDU with a zero length pin may be handled by card is strange ways. AFAIK most card enforce some minimal length for a PIN.  There are fields available for PIN length information in PKCS#15. Internally some cards support ISO VERIFY with 0 length to get remaining tries, a feature used by some pinpad readers. But I find both questionable approaches (as cards that do NOT support it, will either barf or decrease try counter) |

### **[dengert](/dengert)** commented [Oct 19, 2023](#issuecomment-1771649915)

| The following is speculation on how the verify zero len pin could look like it worked. It depends on the card card driver and state of the card. PIN PAD readers follow a different path.  Before [#2806](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/2806) without pin pad reader, it looks `iso7816.c` or other program can call `sc_build_pin` with a zero length pin.  Variable `i` in initialized to 0. depending on type of padding it looks like `i` could endup as zero. `sc_build_pin` returns `i = 0`.  `iso7816_build_pin_apdu` in case: SC\_PIN\_CMD\_VERIFY calls `r = sc_build_pin` and sets `len = r;` i.e. zero and breaks.  ```         sc_format_apdu(card, apdu, cse, ins, p1, data->pin_reference);         apdu->lc = len;         apdu->datalen = len;         apdu->data = buf;         apdu->resplen = 0;  ```  will endup with APDU with Lc=0 with cse=SC\_APDU\_CASE\_3\_SHORT The only difference in this APDU vs a SC\_PIN\_CMD\_GET\_INFO type is the cse=  iso7816\_pin\_cmd will endup calling `r = sc_transmit_apdu(card, apdu);`  `reader-pcsc.c` never tests the cse. so it looks like a request of zero len pin is not a verify but check the login stat apdu. which returns 90 00 if the login state of card is still valid.  What should happen in a verify request should never be sent with zero len pin.  I have not tried this with debugger.  What card was being used when the failure occurred? |

## Description

Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly in the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow

compromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2240913#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-09-27 08:41:15 UTC  ``` Several memory issues that are security relevant that were reported since the release of OpenSC 0.23.0 and that are relevant to the handling the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init.  All of these require physical access to the computer at the time user or administrator would be enrolling the cards (generating keys and loading certificates, other card/token management) operations. The attack requires crafted USB device or smart card that would present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs so they are considered a high-complexity and low-severity. This issue is not exploitable just by using a PKCS#11 module as done in most of the end-user deployments.  <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/2792#issuecomment-1674806651> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/OpenSC-security-advisories> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.24.0-rc1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2240913#c1)  TEJ RATHI    2023-09-27 08:51:05 UTC  ``` All memory issues reference bugs:  * Stack buffer overflow in sc_pkcs15_get_lastupdate in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60769>  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60527>   * Heap buffer overflow in setcos_create_key in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60672>    * Heap buffer overflow in cosm_new_file in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60650>    * Heap double free in sc_pkcs15_free_object_content <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=60616>    * Stack buffer overflow in cflex_delete_file in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=58932>    * Heap buffer overflow in sc_hsm_write_ef in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=56213>    * Stack buffer overflow while parsing pkcs15 profile files <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=55998>  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=55851>   * Stack buffer overflow in muscle driver in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=54312>    * Stack buffer overflow in cardos driver in pkcs15init <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=53927>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2240913#c3)  TEJ RATHI    2023-11-06 06:13:51 UTC  ``` Created opensc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2248099](show_bug.cgi?id=2248099 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-40661 opensc: multiple memory issues with pkcs15-init (enrollment tool) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2240913#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-18 07:38:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:7876 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7876](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7876)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2240913#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-18 11:01:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:7879 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7879](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7879)   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-a854153d7a
2023-12-22 02:42:12.356656
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 0.24.0
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-c7e4c9af51
2023-12-23 04:33:53.210781
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 0.24.0
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

`[Fixed PIN authentication bypass](/frankmorgner/OpenSCToken/pull/50/commits/284526b8e73fda6b5b0d08d148d24dfb4b18455b "Fixed PIN authentication bypass

Due to some previous card operation the key may be unlocked (and ready to sign) even though the PIN was not verified in some new session object. This change enforces the PIN verification independant from the PIN's vefification status.

Before this change, a PIN verification may be bypassed, for example, in the following use case:
	sudo sc_auth pair   -h 7B9E7F52F0309C57CF4C252A5D30B917880DE46F -u username
	sudo sc_auth unpair -h 7B9E7F52F0309C57CF4C252A5D30B917880DE46F -u username
	sudo sc_auth pair   -h 7B9E7F52F0309C57CF4C252A5D30B917880DE46F -u username
In the above workflow, the PIN is only requested in the first pairing, but not in the second call. Even more severe, passing an empty PIN to the Login screen would unlock the screen, since this only checks the PIN verification status (\"verified in a previous session\") and then uses the unlocked key to sign the login challenge.

With this change, OpenSC now enforces a logout of the PIN if the session is deleted. Some cards, however, are not capable of explicitly logging out, so we additionally keep track of the authentication state to enforce the PIN verification in software even though the key would technically be already unlocked.")`

An attacker with physical access to the computer running opensc and crafted USB device or smart card that would present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs so they are considered a high-complexity and low-severity.  This issue is in the code handling symmetric keys, which are not widely used for example for desktop login so most of the deployments are not affected.  <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/2792#issuecomment-1674806651> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/OpenSC-security-advisories> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.24.0-rc1>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2240914#c3)  TEJ RATHI    2023-11-06 06:23:56 UTC  ``` Created opensc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2248101](show_bug.cgi?id=2248101 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-4535 opensc: out-of-bounds read in MyEID driver handling encryption using symmetric keys [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2240914#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-18 11:01:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:7879 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7879](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7879)   ``` |  |
