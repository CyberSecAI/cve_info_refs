| It's great to see the issue acknowledged and a fix already in place in the codebase. I noticed that the fix hasn't been included in an official release yet. Considering the security implications of the vulnerability, I would kindly urge you to expedite the release process if possible. Thank you again for your prompt attention to this matter. Looking forward to the official release. |

**5. Modify the value of the event[event\_title][type] parameter to oNmOuSeOvEr=prompt(1)//, and then allow the request to proceed.**

**6. After moving the cursor over the table, a popup will appear on the web page. Logging out and logging back in still triggers the XSS.**

**7. Switch to the "tom" user account (which also has admin privileges), and moving the cursor over the table again will trigger the XSS. This behavior suggests that it might be a stored XSS.**

**8. However, it's not just the event[event\_banner][type] parameter that can cause XSS. In fact, it is the event[xxx][type] parameter located in the first row of this form that causes XSS. By dragging the button on the left of each row and moving it to the first row, then modifying the POST request's event[xxx][type] to oNmOuSeOvEr=prompt(1)//, XSS can also be triggered. For instance, if you move the "Event Banner" row to the top and modify the POST request's event[event\_banner][type] to oNmOuSeOvEr=prompt(1)//, a popup will appear when the cursor is moved over the form.**

### Description

The WP Event Manager – Events Calendar, Registrations, Sell Tickets with WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 3.1.37.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
