- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate parameters when updating user details.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated privilege escalation due to insufficient parameter validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can update the details of any user, including changing the password of an administrator user, leading to complete compromise of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with the `action=save_customer_details` and user modification parameters to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
