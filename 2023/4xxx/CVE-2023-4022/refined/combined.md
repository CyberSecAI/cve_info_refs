## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Herd Effects < 5.2.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin settings, add a new item and in the "Register an item name" field add the payload: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` and click update.
Go back to the list and edit the recently added item to see the XSS pop up.
