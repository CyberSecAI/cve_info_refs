- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters and generated URLs before outputting them back in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, account takeover, or defacement of the website, especially when targeting high-privilege users like administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious URL with injected JavaScript that, when visited, is reflected back into the page's HTML and executed by the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. No specific user privilege is required, but targeting administrator users would lead to greater impact.
