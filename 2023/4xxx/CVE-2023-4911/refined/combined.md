# Special Interest Group Announcement - Security

Security Special Interest Group

# Special Interest Group Announcement - Security

The Rocky Linux Project announces the general availability of the Security Special Interest Group (SIG) packages and wiki, which provide extra security-related packages and security-hardened override packages (replacing those from the main distribution) for Rocky Linux and other Enterprise Linux (EL) distributions.

## Responsibilities

The Security SIG's mission is to:

* Develop and maintain various security related packages that are not in upstream EL.
* Identify, develop, and maintain security hardening changes relative to upstream EL packages.
* Include/backport additional security fixes that are not yet in upstream EL packages.
* Contribute to the respective upstreams where practical.

Use `dnf install rocky-release-security` to enable the Security SIG repositories containing several overrides for packages in the main distribution.

## Packages

Extra packages include (for EL8 and EL9) `[lkrg](https://lkrg.org/)` (Linux Kernel Runtime Guard) and `[passwdqc](https://www.openwall.com/passwdqc/)` (Password/passphrase strength checking and policy enforcement), while override packages (currently for EL9) include `glibc` (adds many security-hardening changes originating from Owl and ALT Linux on top of EL package) and `openssh` (fewer shared libraries exposed in sshd processes while otherwise fully matching EL package's functionality). More packages are planned.

Security SIG contributor Solar Designer [reassured](https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/1709574519688487374) the community that these repos already include “security-hardened `glibc` for EL9 distros (EL8 soon) with a mitigation effective against CVE-2023-4911.”

## Contributing

If anyone else wants to join this effort - in any capacity including development, maintenance, testing, documentation, user support, spreading the word, or something else - please join the [Mattermost channel](https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/security) and let us know!

All this information and more can be found at the [SIG Wiki](https://sig-security.rocky.page/). Thanks to the team for pulling it together.

Subject: [PATCH] tunables: Terminate if end of input is reached
(CVE-2023-4911)
The string parsing routine may end up writing beyond bounds of tunestr
if the input tunable string is malformed, of the form name=name=val.
This gets processed twice, first as name=name=val and next as name=val,
resulting in tunestr being name=name=val:name=val, thus overflowing
tunestr.
Terminate the parsing loop at the first instance itself so that tunestr
does not overflow.
This also fixes up tst-env-setuid-tunables to actually handle failures
correct and add new tests to validate the fix for this CVE.

## 标题

An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* glibc: buffer overflow in ld.so leading to privilege escalation (CVE-2023-4911)
* glibc: Stack read overflow in getaddrinfo in no-aaaa mode (CVE-2023-4527)
* glibc: potential use-after-free in getaddrinfo() (CVE-2023-4806)
* glibc: potential use-after-free in gaih\_inet() (CVE-2023-4813)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## 解决方案

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the glibc library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

The fix for Rocky 8 and Rocky 9 are purely imports from RHEL:

* R8: <https://git.rockylinux.org/staging/rpms/glibc/-/commit/6433675bfaab392b362993d8ff8d576335e6bcd4>
* R9: <https://git.rockylinux.org/staging/rpms/glibc/-/commit/610a8a6829e1e604ff018daccf6bf63620edd19d>

I did see that Louis Abel attempted to do something for Rocky 8, but
it was not shipped. I have also not seen much in terms of upstream
engagement indicating the bidirectional relationship expected for
members of linux-distros@.

The point I'm making is that SIGs do not count because they cannot
obey embargo regulations. No open project or community project can do
that without having some mechanism for private controls, which is
antithetical to the community process. They fundamentally are
ineligible to join because they cannot keep anything secret.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-028062484e
2023-10-04 15:47:53.759539
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 2.36
Release : 14.fc37
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fix for CVE-2023-4911, CVE-2023-4806, and CVE-2023-4527.
CVE-2023-4911: If a tunable of the form NAME=NAME=VAL is passed in the
environment of a setuid program and NAME is valid, it may result in a buffer
overflow, which could be exploited to achieve escalated privileges. This flaw
was introduced in glibc 2.34. CVE-2023-4806: When an NSS plugin only implements
the \_gethostbyname2\_r and \_getcanonname\_r callbacks, getaddrinfo could use
memory that was freed during buffer resizing, potentially causing a crash or
read or write to arbitrary memory. CVE-2023-4527: If the system is configured
in no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, getaddrinfo is called for the AF\_UNSPEC
address family, and a DNS response is received over TCP that is larger than 2048
bytes, getaddrinfo may potentially disclose stack contents via the returned
address data, or crash.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looney Tunables: Local Privilege Escalation in the glibc's ld.so
(CVE-2023-4911)

Summary
========================================================================

The GNU C Library's dynamic loader "find[s] and load[s] the shared
objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare[s] the program
to run, and then run[s] it" (man ld.so). The dynamic loader is extremely
security sensitive, because its code runs with elevated privileges when
a local user executes a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or
a program with capabilities. Historically, the processing of environment
variables such as LD_PRELOAD, LD_AUDIT, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been a
fertile source of vulnerabilities in the dynamic loader.

Recently, we discovered a vulnerability (a buffer overflow) in the
dynamic loader's processing of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Tunables.html>). This
vulnerability was introduced in April 2021 (glibc 2.34) by commit 2ed18c
("Fix SXID_ERASE behavior in setuid programs (BZ #27471)").

We successfully exploited this vulnerability and obtained full root
privileges on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu
22.04 and 23.04, Debian 12 and 13; other distributions are probably also
vulnerable and exploitable (one notable exception is Alpine Linux, which
uses musl libc, not the glibc). We will not publish our exploit for now;
however, this buffer overflow is easily exploitable (by transforming it
into a data-only attack), and other researchers might publish working
exploits shortly after this coordinated disclosure.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

At the very beginning of its execution, ld.so calls __tunables_init() to
walk through the environment (at line 279), searching for GLIBC_TUNABLES
variables (at line 282); for each GLIBC_TUNABLES that it finds, it makes
a copy of this variable (at line 284), calls parse_tunables() to process
and sanitize this copy (at line 286), and finally replaces the original
GLIBC_TUNABLES with this sanitized copy (at line 288):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
269 void
270 __tunables_init (char **envp)
271 {
272   char *envname = NULL;
273   char *envval = NULL;
274   size_t len = 0;
275   char **prev_envp = envp;
...
279   while ((envp = get_next_env (envp, &envname, &len, &envval,
280                                &prev_envp)) != NULL)
281     {
282       if (tunable_is_name ("GLIBC_TUNABLES", envname))
283         {
284           char *new_env = tunables_strdup (envname);
285           if (new_env != NULL)
286             parse_tunables (new_env + len + 1, envval);
287           /* Put in the updated envval.  */
288           *prev_envp = new_env;
289           continue;
290         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first argument of parse_tunables() (tunestr) points to the
soon-to-be-sanitized copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES, while the second argument
(valstring) points to the original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(in the stack). To sanitize the copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES (which should be
of the form "tunable1=aaa:tunable2=bbb"), parse_tunables() removes all
dangerous tunables (the SXID_ERASE tunables) from tunestr, but keeps
SXID_IGNORE and NONE tunables (at lines 221-235):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
162 static void
163 parse_tunables (char *tunestr, char *valstring)
164 {
...
168   char *p = tunestr;
169   size_t off = 0;
170
171   while (true)
172     {
173       char *name = p;
174       size_t len = 0;

177       while (p[len] != '=' && p[len] != ':' && p[len] != '\0')
178         len++;
179
180       /* If we reach the end of the string before getting a valid name-value
181          pair, bail out.  */
182       if (p[len] == '\0')
183         {
184           if (__libc_enable_secure)
185             tunestr[off] = '\0';
186           return;
187         }
188
189       /* We did not find a valid name-value pair before encountering the
190          colon.  */
191       if (p[len]== ':')
192         {
193           p += len + 1;
194           continue;
195         }
196
197       p += len + 1;
198
199       /* Take the value from the valstring since we need to NULL terminate it.  */
200       char *value = &valstring[p - tunestr];
201       len = 0;
202
203       while (p[len] != ':' && p[len] != '\0')
204         len++;
205
206       /* Add the tunable if it exists.  */

248         p += len + 1;
249     }
250 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if a GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable is of the form
"tunable1=tunable2=AAA" (where "tunable1" and "tunable2" are SXID_IGNORE
tunables, for example "glibc.malloc.mxfast"), then:

- during the first iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  the entire "tunable1=tunable2=AAA" is copied in-place to tunestr (at
  lines 221-235), thus filling up tunestr;

- at lines 247-248, p is not incremented (p[len] is '\0' because no ':'
  was found at lines 203-204) and therefore p still points to the value
  of "tunable1", i.e. "tunable2=AAA";

- during the second iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  "tunable2=AAA" is appended (as if it were a second tunable) to tunestr
  (which is already full), thus overflowing tunestr.

A note on fuzzing: although we discovered this buffer overflow manually,
we later tried to fuzz the vulnerable function, parse_tunables(); both
AFL++ and libFuzzer re-discovered this overflow in less than a second,
when provided with a dictionary of tunables (which can be compiled by
running "ld.so --list-tunables").

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

This vulnerability is a straightforward buffer overflow, but what should
we overwrite to achieve arbitrary code execution? The buffer we overflow
is allocated at line 284 by tunables_strdup(), a re-implementation of
strdup() that uses ld.so's __minimal_malloc() instead of the glibc's
malloc() (indeed, the glibc's malloc() has not been initialized yet).
This __minimal_malloc() implementation simply calls mmap() to obtain
more memory from the kernel.

The question, then, is: what writable pages can we overwrite in the mmap
region? To the best of our knowledge, we have only two options (because
this buffer overflow takes place at the very beginning of ld.so's
execution):

1/ The read-write ELF segment of ld.so itself (the first pages of this
read-write segment are actually ld.so's RELRO segment, but they have not
been mprotect()ed read-only yet):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7f209f367000-7f209f369000 r--p 00000000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f369000-7f209f393000 r-xp 00002000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f393000-7f209f39e000 r--p 0002c000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f39f000-7f209f3a3000 rw-p 00037000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, on all the Linux distributions that we checked, the unmapped
hole immediately below ld.so's read-write segment is at most one page,
but ld.so's __minimal_malloc() always allocates at least two pages ("one
extra page to reduce number of mmap calls"). In other words, the buffer
we overflow cannot be allocated immediately below ld.so's read-write
segment, and therefore cannot overwrite this segment.

2/ Our only option, then, is to overwrite mmap()ed pages that were
allocated by tunables_strdup() itself: because __tunables_init() can
process multiple GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables, and because the
Linux kernel's mmap() is a top-down allocator, we can mmap() a first
GLIBC_TUNABLES (without overflowing it), mmap() a second GLIBC_TUNABLES
(immediately below the first one) and overflow it, thus overwriting the
first GLIBC_TUNABLES. As a result, we can:

- either replace this first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a completely different
  environment variable, for example LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- but
  these dangerous variables are later removed from the environment by
  ld.so (in process_envvars()), and such a replacement would therefore
  be useless;

- or replace the first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a GLIBC_TUNABLES that
  contains dangerous (SXID_ERASE) tunables, which were previously
  removed by parse_tunables() -- although this seems promising at first,
  exploiting such a replacement would require a SUID-root program that
  setuid(0)s and execve()s another program with a preserved environment
  (to process the dangerous GLIBC_TUNABLES as root, but without
  __libc_enable_secure).

  Alas, we do not know of such a SUID-root program on Linux (on OpenBSD,
  /usr/bin/chpass setuid(0)s and execv()s /usr/sbin/pwd_mkdb, and was
  exploited in CVE-2019-19726); if you, dear reader, know of such a
  SUID-root program on Linux, please let us know!

At that point, the situation looked quite hopeless, but a comment in
ld.so's _dl_new_object() (which is called long after __tunables_init())
caught our attention (at line 105):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 56 struct link_map *
 57 _dl_new_object (char *realname, const char *libname, int type,
 58                 struct link_map *loader, int mode, Lmid_t nsid)
 59 {
 ..
 84   struct link_map *new;
 85   struct libname_list *newname;
 ..
 92   new = (struct link_map *) calloc (sizeof (*new) + audit_space
 93                                     + sizeof (struct link_map *)
 94                                     + sizeof (*newname) + libname_len, 1);
 95   if (new == NULL)
 96     return NULL;
 97
 98   new->l_real = new;
 99   new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list = (struct link_map **) ((char *) (new + 1)
100                                                             + audit_space);
101
102   new->l_libname = newname
103     = (struct libname_list *) (new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list + 1);
104   newname->name = (char *) memcpy (newname + 1, libname, libname_len);
105   /* newname->next = NULL;      We use calloc therefore not necessary.  */
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ld.so allocates the memory for this link_map structure with calloc(),
and therefore does not explicitly initialize various of its members to
zero; this is a reasonable optimization. As mentioned earlier, calloc()
here is not the glibc's calloc() but ld.so's __minimal_calloc(), which
calls __minimal_malloc() *without* explicitly initializing the memory it
returns to zero; this is also a reasonable optimization, because for all
intents and purposes __minimal_malloc() always returns a clean chunk of
mmap()ed memory, which is guaranteed to be initialized to zero by the
kernel.

Unfortunately, the buffer overflow in parse_tunables() allows us to
overwrite clean mmap()ed memory with non-zero bytes, thereby overwriting
pointers of the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with non-NULL
values. This allows us to completely break the logic of ld.so, which
assumes that these pointers are NULL.

We first tried to exploit this buffer overflow by overwriting the
link_map structure's l_next and l_prev pointers (a doubly linked list of
link_map structures), but we failed because of two assert()ion failures
in setup_vdso(), which immediately abort() ld.so (all the distributions
that we checked compile their glibc, and hence ld.so, with assert()ions
enabled):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 96       assert (l->l_next == NULL);
 97       assert (l->l_prev == main_map);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then realized that many more pointers in the link_map structure are
not explicitly initialized to NULL; in particular, the pointers to
Elf64_Dyn structures in the l_info[] array of pointers. Among these,
l_info[DT_RPATH], the "Library search path", immediately stood out: if
we overwrite this pointer and control where and what it points to, then
we can force ld.so to trust a directory that we own, and therefore to
load our own libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, and
execute arbitrary code (as root, if we run ld.so through a SUID-root
program).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? The easy answer
to this question is: the stack; more precisely, our environment strings
in the stack. On Linux, the stack is randomized in a 16GB region, and
our environment strings can occupy up to 6MB (_STK_LIM / 4 * 3, in the
kernel's bprm_stack_limits()): after 16GB / 6MB = 2730 tries we have a
good chance of guessing the address of our environment strings (in our
exploit, we always overwrite l_info[DT_RPATH] with 0x7ffdfffff010, the
center of the randomized stack region). In our tests, this brute force
takes ~30s on Debian, and ~5m on Ubuntu and Fedora (because of their
automatic crash handlers, Apport and ABRT; we have not tried to work
around this slowdown).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? In other words,
what should we store in our 6MB of environment strings? l_info[DT_RPATH]
is a pointer to a small (16B) Elf64_Dyn structure:

- an int64_t d_tag, which should be DT_RPATH (15), but this value is
  never actually checked anywhere, so we can store anything there;

- a uint64_t d_val, which is an offset into the ELF string table of the
  SUID-root program that is being executed (this offset references a
  string that is the "Library search path" itself).

In our exploit, we simply fill our 6MB of environment strings with
0xfffffffffffffff8 (-8), because at an offset of -8B below the string
table of most SUID-root programs, the string "\x08" appears: this forces
ld.so to trust a relative directory named "\x08" (in our current working
directory), and therefore allows us to load and execute our own
libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, as root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One major problem remains unsolved, however: to avoid the kind of
assert()ion failures mentioned earlier (when we tried to overwrite the
l_next and l_prev pointers of the link_map structure), we must overwrite
the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with NULL pointers only
(except l_info[DT_RPATH], of course); but intuitively, the ability to
overflow a buffer with a large number of null bytes while parsing a
null-terminated C string sounds quite unusual.

Luckily for us attackers, the bytes that are written out-of-bounds by
parse_tunables() are also read out-of-bounds (at line 234), but not from
the mmap()ed copy of our GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable (tunestr),
but from our original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable in the stack
(valstring, at line 200). Consequently, if we store a large number of
empty strings (null bytes) immediately after our GLIBC_TUNABLES in the
stack, followed by the string "\x10\xf0\xff\xff\xfd\x7f", followed by
more empty strings (null bytes), then we safely overwrite the link_map
structure with null bytes (NULL pointers), except for l_info[DT_RPATH]
(which we overwrite with 0x7ffdfffff010, which points to our own
Elf64_Dyn structures in the stack with a probability of 1/2730).

Final note: the exploitation method described in this advisory works
against almost all of the SUID-root programs that are installed by
default on Linux; a few exceptions are:

- sudo on all distributions, because it specifies its own ELF RUNPATH
  (/usr/libexec/sudo), which overrides our l_info[DT_RPATH];

- chage and passwd on Fedora, because they are protected by special
  SELinux rules;

- snap-confine on Ubuntu, because it is protected by special AppArmor
  rules.

Last-minute note: although glibc 2.34 is vulnerable to this buffer
overflow, its tunables_strdup() uses __sbrk(), not __minimal_malloc()
(which was introduced in glibc 2.35 by commit b05fae, "elf: Use the
minimal malloc on tunables_strdup"); we have not yet investigated
whether glibc 2.34 is exploitable or not.

Summary
========================================================================

The GNU C Library's dynamic loader "find[s] and load[s] the shared
objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare[s] the program
to run, and then run[s] it" (man ld.so). The dynamic loader is extremely
security sensitive, because its code runs with elevated privileges when
a local user executes a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or
a program with capabilities. Historically, the processing of environment
variables such as LD_PRELOAD, LD_AUDIT, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been a
fertile source of vulnerabilities in the dynamic loader.

Recently, we discovered a vulnerability (a buffer overflow) in the
dynamic loader's processing of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Tunables.html>). This
vulnerability was introduced in April 2021 (glibc 2.34) by commit 2ed18c
("Fix SXID_ERASE behavior in setuid programs (BZ #27471)").

We successfully exploited this vulnerability and obtained full root
privileges on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu
22.04 and 23.04, Debian 12 and 13; other distributions are probably also
vulnerable and exploitable (one notable exception is Alpine Linux, which
uses musl libc, not the glibc). We will not publish our exploit for now;
however, this buffer overflow is easily exploitable (by transforming it
into a data-only attack), and other researchers might publish working
exploits shortly after this coordinated disclosure.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

At the very beginning of its execution, ld.so calls __tunables_init() to
walk through the environment (at line 279), searching for GLIBC_TUNABLES
variables (at line 282); for each GLIBC_TUNABLES that it finds, it makes
a copy of this variable (at line 284), calls parse_tunables() to process
and sanitize this copy (at line 286), and finally replaces the original
GLIBC_TUNABLES with this sanitized copy (at line 288):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
269 void
270 __tunables_init (char **envp)
271 {
272   char *envname = NULL;
273   char *envval = NULL;
274   size_t len = 0;
275   char **prev_envp = envp;
...
279   while ((envp = get_next_env (envp, &envname, &len, &envval,
280                                &prev_envp)) != NULL)
281     {
282       if (tunable_is_name ("GLIBC_TUNABLES", envname))
283         {
284           char *new_env = tunables_strdup (envname);
285           if (new_env != NULL)
286             parse_tunables (new_env + len + 1, envval);
287           /* Put in the updated envval.  */
288           *prev_envp = new_env;
289           continue;
290         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first argument of parse_tunables() (tunestr) points to the
soon-to-be-sanitized copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES, while the second argument
(valstring) points to the original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(in the stack). To sanitize the copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES (which should be
of the form "tunable1=aaa:tunable2=bbb"), parse_tunables() removes all
dangerous tunables (the SXID_ERASE tunables) from tunestr, but keeps
SXID_IGNORE and NONE tunables (at lines 221-235):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
162 static void
163 parse_tunables (char *tunestr, char *valstring)
164 {
...
168   char *p = tunestr;
169   size_t off = 0;
170
171   while (true)
172     {
173       char *name = p;
174       size_t len = 0;
175
176       /* First, find where the name ends.  */
177       while (p[len] != '=' && p[len] != ':' && p[len] != '\0')
178         len++;
179
180       /* If we reach the end of the string before getting a valid name-value
181          pair, bail out.  */
182       if (p[len] == '\0')
183         {
184           if (__libc_enable_secure)
185             tunestr[off] = '\0';
186           return;
187         }
188
189       /* We did not find a valid name-value pair before encountering the
190          colon.  */

Unfortunately, if a GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable is of the form
"tunable1=tunable2=AAA" (where "tunable1" and "tunable2" are SXID_IGNORE
tunables, for example "glibc.malloc.mxfast"), then:

- during the first iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  the entire "tunable1=tunable2=AAA" is copied in-place to tunestr (at
  lines 221-235), thus filling up tunestr;

- at lines 247-248, p is not incremented (p[len] is '\0' because no ':'
  was found at lines 203-204) and therefore p still points to the value
  of "tunable1", i.e. "tunable2=AAA";

- during the second iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  "tunable2=AAA" is appended (as if it were a second tunable) to tunestr
  (which is already full), thus overflowing tunestr.

A note on fuzzing: although we discovered this buffer overflow manually,
we later tried to fuzz the vulnerable function, parse_tunables(); both
AFL++ and libFuzzer re-discovered this overflow in less than a second,
when provided with a dictionary of tunables (which can be compiled by
running "ld.so --list-tunables").

========================================================================

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

This vulnerability is a straightforward buffer overflow, but what should
we overwrite to achieve arbitrary code execution? The buffer we overflow
is allocated at line 284 by tunables_strdup(), a re-implementation of
strdup() that uses ld.so's __minimal_malloc() instead of the glibc's
malloc() (indeed, the glibc's malloc() has not been initialized yet).
This __minimal_malloc() implementation simply calls mmap() to obtain
more memory from the kernel.

The question, then, is: what writable pages can we overwrite in the mmap
region? To the best of our knowledge, we have only two options (because
this buffer overflow takes place at the very beginning of ld.so's
execution):

1/ The read-write ELF segment of ld.so itself (the first pages of this
read-write segment are actually ld.so's RELRO segment, but they have not
been mprotect()ed read-only yet):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7f209f367000-7f209f369000 r--p 00000000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f369000-7f209f393000 r-xp 00002000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f393000-7f209f39e000 r--p 0002c000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f39f000-7f209f3a3000 rw-p 00037000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, on all the Linux distributions that we checked, the unmapped
hole immediately below ld.so's read-write segment is at most one page,
but ld.so's __minimal_malloc() always allocates at least two pages ("one
extra page to reduce number of mmap calls"). In other words, the buffer
we overflow cannot be allocated immediately below ld.so's read-write
segment, and therefore cannot overwrite this segment.

2/ Our only option, then, is to overwrite mmap()ed pages that were
allocated by tunables_strdup() itself: because __tunables_init() can
process multiple GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables, and because the
Linux kernel's mmap() is a top-down allocator, we can mmap() a first
GLIBC_TUNABLES (without overflowing it), mmap() a second GLIBC_TUNABLES
(immediately below the first one) and overflow it, thus overwriting the
first GLIBC_TUNABLES. As a result, we can:

- either replace this first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a completely different
  environment variable, for example LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- but
  these dangerous variables are later removed from the environment by
  ld.so (in process_envvars()), and such a replacement would therefore
  be useless;

- or replace the first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a GLIBC_TUNABLES that
  contains dangerous (SXID_ERASE) tunables, which were previously
  removed by parse_tunables() -- although this seems promising at first,
  exploiting such a replacement would require a SUID-root program that
  setuid(0)s and execve()s another program with a preserved environment
  (to process the dangerous GLIBC_TUNABLES as root, but without
  __libc_enable_secure).

  Alas, we do not know of such a SUID-root program on Linux (on OpenBSD,
  /usr/bin/chpass setuid(0)s and execv()s /usr/sbin/pwd_mkdb, and was
  exploited in CVE-2019-19726); if you, dear reader, know of such a
  SUID-root program on Linux, please let us know!

At that point, the situation looked quite hopeless, but a comment in
ld.so's _dl_new_object() (which is called long after __tunables_init())
caught our attention (at line 105):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 56 struct link_map *
 57 _dl_new_object (char *realname, const char *libname, int type,
 58                 struct link_map *loader, int mode, Lmid_t nsid)
 59 {
 ..
 84   struct link_map *new;
 85   struct libname_list *newname;
 ..
 92   new = (struct link_map *) calloc (sizeof (*new) + audit_space
 93                                     + sizeof (struct link_map *)
 94                                     + sizeof (*newname) + libname_len, 1);
 95   if (new == NULL)
 96     return NULL;
 97
 98   new->l_real = new;
 99   new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list = (struct link_map **) ((char *) (new + 1)
100                                                             + audit_space);
101
102   new->l_libname = newname
103     = (struct libname_list *) (new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list + 1);
104   newname->name = (char *) memcpy (newname + 1, libname, libname_len);
105   /* newname->next = NULL;      We use calloc therefore not necessary.  */
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ld.so allocates the memory for this link_map structure with calloc(),
and therefore does not explicitly initialize various of its members to
zero; this is a reasonable optimization. As mentioned earlier, calloc()
here is not the glibc's calloc() but ld.so's __minimal_calloc(), which
calls __minimal_malloc() *without* explicitly initializing the memory it
returns to zero; this is also a reasonable optimization, because for all
intents and purposes __minimal_malloc() always returns a clean chunk of
mmap()ed memory, which is guaranteed to be initialized to zero by the
kernel.

Unfortunately, the buffer overflow in parse_tunables() allows us to
overwrite clean mmap()ed memory with non-zero bytes, thereby overwriting
pointers of the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with non-NULL
values. This allows us to completely break the logic of ld.so, which
assumes that these pointers are NULL.

We first tried to exploit this buffer overflow by overwriting the
link_map structure's l_next and l_prev pointers (a doubly linked list of
link_map structures), but we failed because of two assert()ion failures
in setup_vdso(), which immediately abort() ld.so (all the distributions
that we checked compile their glibc, and hence ld.so, with assert()ions
enabled):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 96       assert (l->l_next == NULL);
 97       assert (l->l_prev == main_map);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then realized that many more pointers in the link_map structure are
not explicitly initialized to NULL; in particular, the pointers to
Elf64_Dyn structures in the l_info[] array of pointers. Among these,
l_info[DT_RPATH], the "Library search path", immediately stood out: if
we overwrite this pointer and control where and what it points to, then
we can force ld.so to trust a directory that we own, and therefore to
load our own libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, and
execute arbitrary code (as root, if we run ld.so through a SUID-root
program).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? The easy answer
to this question is: the stack; more precisely, our environment strings
in the stack. On Linux, the stack is randomized in a 16GB region, and
our environment strings can occupy up to 6MB (_STK_LIM / 4 * 3, in the
kernel's bprm_stack_limits()): after 16GB / 6MB = 2730 tries we have a
good chance of guessing the address of our environment strings (in our
exploit, we always overwrite l_info[DT_RPATH] with 0x7ffdfffff010, the
center of the randomized stack region). In our tests, this brute force
takes ~30s on Debian, and ~5m on Ubuntu and Fedora (because of their
automatic crash handlers, Apport and ABRT; we have not tried to work
around this slowdown).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? In other words,
what should we store in our 6MB of environment strings? l_info[DT_RPATH]
is a pointer to a small (16B) Elf64_Dyn structure:

- an int64_t d_tag, which should be DT_RPATH (15), but this value is
  never actually checked anywhere, so we can store anything there;

- a uint64_t d_val, which is an offset into the ELF string table of the
  SUID-root program that is being executed (this offset references a
  string that is the "Library search path" itself).

In our exploit, we simply fill our 6MB of environment strings with
0xfffffffffffffff8 (-8), because at an offset of -8B below the string
table of most SUID-root programs, the string "\x08" appears: this forces
ld.so to trust a relative directory named "\x08" (in our current working
directory), and therefore allows us to load and execute our own
libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, as root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One major problem remains unsolved, however: to avoid the kind of
assert()ion failures mentioned earlier (when we tried to overwrite the
l_next and l_prev pointers of the link_map structure), we must overwrite
the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with NULL pointers only
(except l_info[DT_RPATH], of course); but intuitively, the ability to
overflow a buffer with a large number of null bytes while parsing a
null-terminated C string sounds quite unusual.

Luckily for us attackers, the bytes that are written out-of-bounds by
parse_tunables() are also read out-of-bounds (at line 234), but not from
the mmap()ed copy of our GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable (tunestr),
but from our original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable in the stack
(valstring, at line 200). Consequently, if we store a large number of
empty strings (null bytes) immediately after our GLIBC_TUNABLES in the
stack, followed by the string "\x10\xf0\xff\xff\xfd\x7f", followed by
more empty strings (null bytes), then we safely overwrite the link_map
structure with null bytes (NULL pointers), except for l_info[DT_RPATH]
(which we overwrite with 0x7ffdfffff010, which points to our own
Elf64_Dyn structures in the stack with a probability of 1/2730).

Final note: the exploitation method described in this advisory works
against almost all of the SUID-root programs that are installed by
default on Linux; a few exceptions are:

- sudo on all distributions, because it specifies its own ELF RUNPATH
  (/usr/libexec/sudo), which overrides our l_info[DT_RPATH];

- chage and passwd on Fedora, because they are protected by special
  SELinux rules;

- snap-confine on Ubuntu, because it is protected by special AppArmor
  rules.

Last-minute note: although glibc 2.34 is vulnerable to this buffer
overflow, its tunables_strdup() uses __sbrk(), not __minimal_malloc()
(which was introduced in glibc 2.35 by commit b05fae, "elf: Use the
minimal malloc on tunables_strdup"); we have not yet investigated
whether glibc 2.34 is exploitable or not.

Subject: Re: linux-distros list membership application - CIQ Rocky Linux Security Team

Hi Neal,

Thank you for bringing up your objections and rationale.

I find some of your arguments valid (but insufficient to block this
application), some others not.  Anyhow, this is an opportunity for us to
discuss how the various projects (distros, SIGs) handle things and
whether they're represented or eligible for (linux-)distros membership.

A recurring theme in both of your messages is whether an "open project
or community project" can be represented on (linux-)distros.  Your
answer is no because "there is no mechanism in the project to hide
anything from the community."  My answer is yes if there is such a
mechanism despite of the project being open/community in other ways.

For example, Debian is an open community project, yet Debian is
explicitly listed as a linux-distros member and indeed representatives
from Debian's security team are subscribed and the team manages to
prepare security updates without breaking embargoes.  How exactly they
do it I don't know, but I assume they have a mechanism.

You say that "Fedora is not a member".  While we do not specifically
list Fedora as a member, we do list Red Hat, and my understanding is
that this includes representation for Fedora - not from the open
community side of it, but from Red Hat's side of it.  Using the glibc
CVE-2023-4911 example and Red Hat Bugzilla entries:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238352>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241966>

we can see that Zack Miele at Red Hat both participated in handling of
the incoming embargoed issue report (in this case, presumably Red Hat
was directly notified by Qualys a couple of weeks before the issue was
brought to linux-distros, which is fine) and created the public entry
for Fedora at 2023-10-03 17:12 UTC, which is almost exactly at the
pre-agreed public disclosure date/time of 2023-10-03 17:00 UTC.  The
first Fedora glibc package update listed in there is glibc-2.38-6.fc39
at 20:05 UTC, a mere 3 hours later, or a mere 2 hours after Qualys'
actual public disclosure of the issue (the oss-security posting was at
17:50 UTC).  That's great.  Looking at the package change log:

<https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/glibc/glibc/fedora-39.html>

We see the relevant change was made by "Arjun Shankar <arjun at redhat
dot com>", so also by someone at Red Hat.  I doubt we'd see such quick
handling of the issue without preparedness from Red Hat's side, and thus
without Red Hat having advance knowledge of the issue.  While for this
specific issue they had knowledge before linux-distros, I think it's the
same in cases where the issue first gets to Red Hat via linux-distros -
they don't forget about preparedness also for Fedora.

What I am proposing for CIQ and Rocky Linux is similar - only "CIQ Rocky
Linux Security Team" would receive the embargoed information, and (at
least for issues above an overall severity threshold, like this glibc
one was) would help ensure preparedness for both CIQ LTS branches and
Rocky Linux, without leaking the information to CIQ customers nor to the
entire Rocky Linux community prematurely.

Some further comments inline:

Fair enough.  Ideally, we'd also have public track record showing CIQ's
LTS branch updates, but unfortunately this is not currently public.  So
we have this combination of publicly verifiable track record of rebuilds
and republishing (which shows that the project cares and is long-term),
statement that own updates were also being made for LTS branches, and
public information on recent own updates via the SIG (no track record,
but demonstrates capability, infrastructure setup, and intent).

The timely rebuilds alone satisfy the criterion's current wording.  Not
being a rebuild-only distro or having additional justification is a
separate criterion, which does not require a long-term track record.

I think this combination (barely) clears the bar for the two criteria.

There are occasional hiccups with receiving the upstream distro's errata
publications.  In fact, I am aware of a missing recent security
advisory, even though the actual update packages are there - I'm told
this one Red Hat advisory is mysteriously missing from the specific
upstream API we use, which will hopefully be corrected by switching to
another available API for these.  So yes, there are such examples.

However, the criterion isn't that 100% of updates and publications must
be quick.  Things do go wrong sometimes, and updates for lower severity
issues are often reasonably delayed, including by current linux-distros
members and especially for issues that were not even handled via the
list.  Rather, the criterion should be that updates are typically quick,
especially for high severity issues handled via linux-distros, so that
membership could make these even quicker.

I see that the current wording mentions specific delays, but does not
mention issue severity - perhaps that's something to add, as it's
unreasonable to insist on quick fixes for low severity issues (they're
nice to have and provide extra justification, but not a requirement).

> Example on releases: <https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/18/rocky_linux_9/>

Rocky Linux 8 remained fully supported (and still is), so the delay in
releasing Rocky Linux 9 is of no direct relevance to this application.

It's great that AlmaLinux was much quicker, and this may (or may not)
indirectly compare the teams' capabilities (or maybe focus areas), but
for the purpose of this membership application it's not a competition.

I note that you're not arguing against CIQ LTS branches being relevant.
Great.  As to the SIGs, no, I am not "saying that all Rocky Linux SIGs
are shadows of CIQ work", but there is overlap in people involved and
occasionally CIQ can help prepare important security updates "that can
be held back for public consumption" until the coordinated release date.

Current membership criteria start with "Be an actively maintained
Unix-like operating system distro with substantial use of Open Source
components", so a SIG like these isn't eligible because of not being a
complete "operating system distro".  However, if Red Hat would manage to
contribute to their related SIGs' preparedness without breaking list
rules, that would be allowed.  Specifically, the rules allow to share
information "with others within your distro's team based on their
need-to-know" as long as they also accepted the rules.  So if a person
directly with the distro takes a SIG's package, prepares an update, and
only makes it available to the SIG on the CRD, that's fine.  Ditto if
it's the same person wearing two hats.

Similarly, Rocky Linux SIGs are not eligible on their own, but the
distro's security team can contribute to them as the rules permit.

This applies to the main Rocky Linux distribution.  Yes, with only that
one distribution we'd not have "convincing additional justification of
how the list membership would enable you to release fixes sooner" and
thus be disqualified.  However, the existence of CIQ LTS branches and of
Rocky Linux SIGs changes that, as the team to be subscribed(*) is to
provide security maintenance for these, and via the Security SIG also
optional mitigations and early fixes for Rocky Linux.

(*) or who I'd initially be relaying specific bits of info to, based on
their need-to-know and indeed understanding and acceptance of the terms

Fair enough.  I wish more about CIQ's offerings were available publicly.

However, I feel that what I described above is sufficient for the
purpose of linux-distros membership.

Yes, CentOS' membership pre-dates the current specific criteria, and I
don't know if CentOS would be accepted today.  As a rebuild only, it
would not be, but if they offered to provide security maintenance for
extras from their SIGs, maybe.

Anyway, the current CentOS Stream is a project of Red Hat, and it's up
to Red Hat to provide security maintenance for it or not, including
using information obtained via linux-distros as the rules permit.

Thank you for sharing your perspective on this.  Makes sense.  From my
perspective, Fedora isn't explicitly a member because it does not need
to be, with that kind of preparedness provided by Red Hat.

We could go into hair-splitting and require that RHEL, Fedora, and
CentOS Stream be individually listed as member distros.  Maybe this
would actually help some issue reporters understand which distros
they're notifying, so it isn't necessarily unreasonable.  However, in
terms of people subscribed I think it'd be just Red Hat folks wearing a
variety of project hats anyway, so is easier to manage as one member.

Of course not - the new member also needs to meet the criteria, and I
think it does (even if barely so for the not-only-rebuild one).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-63e5a77522
2023-10-04 17:15:10.480213
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 2.38
Release : 6.fc39
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fix for CVE-2023-4911, CVE-2023-4806, and CVE-2023-4527.
CVE-2023-4911: If a tunable of the form NAME=NAME=VAL is passed in the
environment of a setuid program and NAME is valid, it may result in a buffer
overflow, which could be exploited to achieve escalated privileges. This flaw
was introduced in glibc 2.34. CVE-2023-4806: When an NSS plugin only implements
the \_gethostbyname2\_r and \_getcanonname\_r callbacks, getaddrinfo could use
memory that was freed during buffer resizing, potentially causing a crash or
read or write to arbitrary memory. CVE-2023-4527: If the system is configured
in no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, getaddrinfo is called for the AF\_UNSPEC
address family, and a DNS response is received over TCP that is larger than 2048
bytes, getaddrinfo may potentially disclose stack contents via the returned
address data, or crash.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : glibc
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-4911

The Qualys Research Labs discovered a buffer overflow in the dynamic
loader's processing of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable. An
attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
<https://www.qualys.com/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4911/looney-tunables-local-privilege-escalation-glibc-ld-so.txt>

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.31-13+deb11u7.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.36-9+deb12u3. This update includes fixes for CVE-2023-4527 and
CVE-2023-4806 originally planned for the upcoming bookworm point
release.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* glibc: buffer overflow in ld.so leading to privilege escalation (CVE-2023-4911)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the glibc library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function may access memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the \_nss\_\*\_gethostbyname2\_r and \_nss\_\*\_getcanonname\_r hooks without implementing the \_nss\_\*\_gethostbyname3\_r hook. The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF\_INET6 address family with AI\_CANONNAME, AI\_ALL and AI\_V4MAPPED as flags. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2237782#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-09-06 20:48:11 UTC  ``` In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function in glibc may access memory that has already been freed, resulting in an application crash.  This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r hook without implementing the _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook. There are no known modules that are implemented in this way.  In addition to that condition, the resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 as well as IPv4 and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have AF_INET6 with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.

A clarification on this: the NSS module needs to do *all* of the following to expose the vulnerability:  1) Implement _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r hook 2) implement _nss_*_getcanonname_r hook 3) NOT implement _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook  The samba wins module for example satisfies 1) and 3) but not 2) thus eliminating it as a possible vector for this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2237782#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-05 13:54:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:5453 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5453)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2237782#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-05 14:01:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:5455 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5455)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2237782#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-21 11:42:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:7409 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7409)   ``` |  |

Right, but we also had an effective mitigation for R9 pushed publicly in
Security SIG on Oct 3, same day as the vulnerability was made public:

<https://sig-security.rocky.page/packages/glibc/>

This was possible due to explicit permission I requested/obtained from
Qualys in a thread on linux-distros.  The rules do mention that things
like that can be done "with the reporter's explicit approval".  (This
option also came up in the recent discussion around illumos distros.)

Yes, I noticed this one too and asked him about it, and yes it was just
a test that was not shipped.

I would be pushing a Security SIG package addressing the issue for R8 as
well if we didn't get upstream's update for a day more (after Oct 5).

I agree this is something to improve, and I intend to be contributing to
that with my CIQ or Rocky Linux hat on, as well as encourage others with
Rocky Linux to contribute to upstreams more.

I did contribute to the linux-distros discussion on this glibc issue, to
an extent greater than I would have without intent to push a mitigation
or fix into Rocky Linux Security SIG.

Quoting from the above web page:

"CIQ offers an additional paid service for customers: Rocky Linux Long
Term Support ("LTS"). This is designed for organizations who want to
remain on a previous minor release of Rocky Linux (like 8.6), which is
no longer supported by the public project. CIQ staff will continue
backporting security and bug fixes into the supported minor releases for
a period of time, after the public project has retired that minor
release.

Subscribed customers who value stability can remain on their desired
release longer, while still enjoying minor security and bugfix updates
to their packages. As of this writing, CIQ is supporting non-zero,
even-numbered point releases (8.6, 8.8, 9.2, 9.4, etc.) with its LTS
offerings. LTS support lasts for 18 months after the release is retired
from the public project. For example, Rocky 8.6 was retired in November
2022. CIQ's LTS-8.6 support will last 18 months from that, or May 2024."

SIGs are ineligible to join on their own.  A distro's security team that
would only push to SIGs on the coordinated release date can.

I'd like to give an example against this. With the recent glibc issue
(CVE-2023-4911) we were closely following the upcoming fixed packages.
While we were installing the Rocky packages in the late evening of Thu Oct 5,
I had the impression that the Redhat packages became available later on Friday.
It might be attributed to some hours of delay between arriving on the repo
servers vs. being announced via advisory. But, anyhow, accusing Rocky being
late in providing packages at least is not valid in general imho. At least
important ones, like this one, seem to arrive rather quickly. Without mentioning
the distros, I have seen quite some announcements even around a week later.

I think the point here is "*not only* being a rebuild of another distro".
So, their engagement with SIG should already be a valid add-on to be honored.
Anyhow, the fact that CIQ offers LTS branches and professional support,
as well as their promise to provide backports of upstream fixes independent
of RHEL clearly distinguishes them from a "pure distro rebuild".

You could take the hardened glibc version of the before mentioned SIG for this

<https://rockylinux.org/news/security-sig-update/>

Note, this is a different story than the backport of the fix for CVE-2023-4911.

Well, assuming there was a security team in these projects able to obey
the embargo regulations, wouldn't they have tried to join?
But, nevertheless, what is the relation of the organizational structure
of these projects with the current application of CIQ/Rocky, after all?

The membership on the list is always by person, and it is always
on behalf of a distro. The fact that Alexander is already engaged in
the Security SIG @Rocky already makes it a reasonable next step
to represent them on the linux-distros list.

Furthermore, I would like to express my deep admiration for his
very professional way of working. Especially in this case, when it
is about his own person, he handles the application process transparently
as if it was any other distro's. Sure, that's one would expect in
this position, but it's just another proof in a long list that he is
the right person to do this job of running, maintaining, and moderating
these lists.

Not being member of any distribution, but a long-time subscriber to
oss-sec, fd, and others, I give my vote for Alexander as a representative
of CIQ Rocky Linux Security Team on linux-distros list.

Best regards,
Martin

Looney Tunables: Local Privilege Escalation in the glibc's ld.so
(CVE-2023-4911)

Summary
========================================================================

The GNU C Library's dynamic loader "find[s] and load[s] the shared
objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare[s] the program
to run, and then run[s] it" (man ld.so). The dynamic loader is extremely
security sensitive, because its code runs with elevated privileges when
a local user executes a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or
a program with capabilities. Historically, the processing of environment
variables such as LD_PRELOAD, LD_AUDIT, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been a
fertile source of vulnerabilities in the dynamic loader.

Recently, we discovered a vulnerability (a buffer overflow) in the
dynamic loader's processing of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Tunables.html>). This
vulnerability was introduced in April 2021 (glibc 2.34) by commit 2ed18c
("Fix SXID_ERASE behavior in setuid programs (BZ #27471)").

We successfully exploited this vulnerability and obtained full root
privileges on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu
22.04 and 23.04, Debian 12 and 13; other distributions are probably also
vulnerable and exploitable (one notable exception is Alpine Linux, which
uses musl libc, not the glibc). We will not publish our exploit for now;
however, this buffer overflow is easily exploitable (by transforming it
into a data-only attack), and other researchers might publish working
exploits shortly after this coordinated disclosure.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

At the very beginning of its execution, ld.so calls __tunables_init() to
walk through the environment (at line 279), searching for GLIBC_TUNABLES
variables (at line 282); for each GLIBC_TUNABLES that it finds, it makes
a copy of this variable (at line 284), calls parse_tunables() to process
and sanitize this copy (at line 286), and finally replaces the original
GLIBC_TUNABLES with this sanitized copy (at line 288):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
269 void
270 __tunables_init (char **envp)
271 {
272   char *envname = NULL;
273   char *envval = NULL;
274   size_t len = 0;
275   char **prev_envp = envp;
...
279   while ((envp = get_next_env (envp, &envname, &len, &envval,
280                                &prev_envp)) != NULL)
281     {
282       if (tunable_is_name ("GLIBC_TUNABLES", envname))
283         {
284           char *new_env = tunables_strdup (envname);
285           if (new_env != NULL)
286             parse_tunables (new_env + len + 1, envval);
287           /* Put in the updated envval.  */
288           *prev_envp = new_env;
289           continue;
290         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first argument of parse_tunables() (tunestr) points to the
soon-to-be-sanitized copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES, while the second argument
(valstring) points to the original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable
(in the stack). To sanitize the copy of GLIBC_TUNABLES (which should be
of the form "tunable1=aaa:tunable2=bbb"), parse_tunables() removes all
dangerous tunables (the SXID_ERASE tunables) from tunestr, but keeps
SXID_IGNORE and NONE tunables (at lines 221-235):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
162 static void
163 parse_tunables (char *tunestr, char *valstring)
164 {
...
168   char *p = tunestr;
169   size_t off = 0;
170
171   while (true)

179
180       /* If we reach the end of the string before getting a valid name-value
181          pair, bail out.  */
182       if (p[len] == '\0')
183         {
184           if (__libc_enable_secure)
185             tunestr[off] = '\0';
186           return;
187         }

191       if (p[len]== ':')
192         {
193           p += len + 1;
194           continue;
195         }

201       len = 0;
202
203       while (p[len] != ':' && p[len] != '\0')
204         len++;
205
206       /* Add the tunable if it exists.  */
207       for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof (tunable_list) / sizeof (tunable_t); i++)
208         {
209           tunable_t *cur = &tunable_list[i];
210

229                         tunestr[off++] = *n++;
230
231                       tunestr[off++] = '=';
232
233                       for (size_t j = 0; j < len; j++)
234                         tunestr[off++] = value[j];
235                     }
236
237                   if (cur->security_level != TUNABLE_SECLEVEL_NONE)
238                     break;
239                 }
240
241               value[len] = '\0';
242               tunable_initialize (cur, value);
243               break;
244             }
245         }
246
247       if (p[len] != '\0')
248         p += len + 1;
249     }
250 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if a GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable is of the form
"tunable1=tunable2=AAA" (where "tunable1" and "tunable2" are SXID_IGNORE
tunables, for example "glibc.malloc.mxfast"), then:

- during the first iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  the entire "tunable1=tunable2=AAA" is copied in-place to tunestr (at
  lines 221-235), thus filling up tunestr;

- at lines 247-248, p is not incremented (p[len] is '\0' because no ':'
  was found at lines 203-204) and therefore p still points to the value
  of "tunable1", i.e. "tunable2=AAA";

- during the second iteration of the "while (true)" in parse_tunables(),
  "tunable2=AAA" is appended (as if it were a second tunable) to tunestr
  (which is already full), thus overflowing tunestr.

A note on fuzzing: although we discovered this buffer overflow manually,
we later tried to fuzz the vulnerable function, parse_tunables(); both
AFL++ and libFuzzer re-discovered this overflow in less than a second,
when provided with a dictionary of tunables (which can be compiled by
running "ld.so --list-tunables").

========================================================================
Proof of concept

$ env -i "GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.mxfast=glibc.malloc.mxfast=A" "Z=`printf '%08192x' 1`" /usr/bin/su --help

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

This vulnerability is a straightforward buffer overflow, but what should
we overwrite to achieve arbitrary code execution? The buffer we overflow
is allocated at line 284 by tunables_strdup(), a re-implementation of
strdup() that uses ld.so's __minimal_malloc() instead of the glibc's
malloc() (indeed, the glibc's malloc() has not been initialized yet).
This __minimal_malloc() implementation simply calls mmap() to obtain
more memory from the kernel.

The question, then, is: what writable pages can we overwrite in the mmap
region? To the best of our knowledge, we have only two options (because
this buffer overflow takes place at the very beginning of ld.so's
execution):

1/ The read-write ELF segment of ld.so itself (the first pages of this
read-write segment are actually ld.so's RELRO segment, but they have not
been mprotect()ed read-only yet):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
7f209f367000-7f209f369000 r--p 00000000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f369000-7f209f393000 r-xp 00002000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f393000-7f209f39e000 r--p 0002c000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f39f000-7f209f3a3000 rw-p 00037000 fd:00 10943                      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, on all the Linux distributions that we checked, the unmapped
hole immediately below ld.so's read-write segment is at most one page,
but ld.so's __minimal_malloc() always allocates at least two pages ("one
extra page to reduce number of mmap calls"). In other words, the buffer
we overflow cannot be allocated immediately below ld.so's read-write
segment, and therefore cannot overwrite this segment.

2/ Our only option, then, is to overwrite mmap()ed pages that were
allocated by tunables_strdup() itself: because __tunables_init() can
process multiple GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables, and because the
Linux kernel's mmap() is a top-down allocator, we can mmap() a first
GLIBC_TUNABLES (without overflowing it), mmap() a second GLIBC_TUNABLES
(immediately below the first one) and overflow it, thus overwriting the
first GLIBC_TUNABLES. As a result, we can:

- either replace this first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a completely different
  environment variable, for example LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- but
  these dangerous variables are later removed from the environment by
  ld.so (in process_envvars()), and such a replacement would therefore
  be useless;

- or replace the first GLIBC_TUNABLES with a GLIBC_TUNABLES that
  contains dangerous (SXID_ERASE) tunables, which were previously
  removed by parse_tunables() -- although this seems promising at first,
  exploiting such a replacement would require a SUID-root program that
  setuid(0)s and execve()s another program with a preserved environment
  (to process the dangerous GLIBC_TUNABLES as root, but without
  __libc_enable_secure).

  Alas, we do not know of such a SUID-root program on Linux (on OpenBSD,
  /usr/bin/chpass setuid(0)s and execv()s /usr/sbin/pwd_mkdb, and was
  exploited in CVE-2019-19726); if you, dear reader, know of such a
  SUID-root program on Linux, please let us know!

At that point, the situation looked quite hopeless, but a comment in
ld.so's _dl_new_object() (which is called long after __tunables_init())
caught our attention (at line 105):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 56 struct link_map *
 57 _dl_new_object (char *realname, const char *libname, int type,
 58                 struct link_map *loader, int mode, Lmid_t nsid)
 59 {
 ..
 84   struct link_map *new;
 85   struct libname_list *newname;
 ..
 92   new = (struct link_map *) calloc (sizeof (*new) + audit_space
 93                                     + sizeof (struct link_map *)
 94                                     + sizeof (*newname) + libname_len, 1);
 95   if (new == NULL)
 96     return NULL;
 97
 98   new->l_real = new;
 99   new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list = (struct link_map **) ((char *) (new + 1)
100                                                             + audit_space);
101
102   new->l_libname = newname
103     = (struct libname_list *) (new->l_symbolic_searchlist.r_list + 1);
104   newname->name = (char *) memcpy (newname + 1, libname, libname_len);
105   /* newname->next = NULL;      We use calloc therefore not necessary.  */
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ld.so allocates the memory for this link_map structure with calloc(),
and therefore does not explicitly initialize various of its members to
zero; this is a reasonable optimization. As mentioned earlier, calloc()
here is not the glibc's calloc() but ld.so's __minimal_calloc(), which
calls __minimal_malloc() *without* explicitly initializing the memory it
returns to zero; this is also a reasonable optimization, because for all
intents and purposes __minimal_malloc() always returns a clean chunk of
mmap()ed memory, which is guaranteed to be initialized to zero by the
kernel.

Unfortunately, the buffer overflow in parse_tunables() allows us to
overwrite clean mmap()ed memory with non-zero bytes, thereby overwriting
pointers of the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with non-NULL
values. This allows us to completely break the logic of ld.so, which
assumes that these pointers are NULL.

We first tried to exploit this buffer overflow by overwriting the
link_map structure's l_next and l_prev pointers (a doubly linked list of
link_map structures), but we failed because of two assert()ion failures
in setup_vdso(), which immediately abort() ld.so (all the distributions
that we checked compile their glibc, and hence ld.so, with assert()ions
enabled):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 96       assert (l->l_next == NULL);
 97       assert (l->l_prev == main_map);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then realized that many more pointers in the link_map structure are
not explicitly initialized to NULL; in particular, the pointers to
Elf64_Dyn structures in the l_info[] array of pointers. Among these,
l_info[DT_RPATH], the "Library search path", immediately stood out: if
we overwrite this pointer and control where and what it points to, then
we can force ld.so to trust a directory that we own, and therefore to
load our own libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, and
execute arbitrary code (as root, if we run ld.so through a SUID-root
program).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? The easy answer
to this question is: the stack; more precisely, our environment strings
in the stack. On Linux, the stack is randomized in a 16GB region, and
our environment strings can occupy up to 6MB (_STK_LIM / 4 * 3, in the
kernel's bprm_stack_limits()): after 16GB / 6MB = 2730 tries we have a
good chance of guessing the address of our environment strings (in our
exploit, we always overwrite l_info[DT_RPATH] with 0x7ffdfffff010, the
center of the randomized stack region). In our tests, this brute force
takes ~30s on Debian, and ~5m on Ubuntu and Fedora (because of their
automatic crash handlers, Apport and ABRT; we have not tried to work
around this slowdown).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What should the overwritten l_info[DT_RPATH] point to? In other words,
what should we store in our 6MB of environment strings? l_info[DT_RPATH]
is a pointer to a small (16B) Elf64_Dyn structure:

- an int64_t d_tag, which should be DT_RPATH (15), but this value is
  never actually checked anywhere, so we can store anything there;

- a uint64_t d_val, which is an offset into the ELF string table of the
  SUID-root program that is being executed (this offset references a
  string that is the "Library search path" itself).

In our exploit, we simply fill our 6MB of environment strings with
0xfffffffffffffff8 (-8), because at an offset of -8B below the string
table of most SUID-root programs, the string "\x08" appears: this forces
ld.so to trust a relative directory named "\x08" (in our current working
directory), and therefore allows us to load and execute our own
libc.so.6 or LD_PRELOAD library from this directory, as root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One major problem remains unsolved, however: to avoid the kind of
assert()ion failures mentioned earlier (when we tried to overwrite the
l_next and l_prev pointers of the link_map structure), we must overwrite
the soon-to-be-allocated link_map structure with NULL pointers only
(except l_info[DT_RPATH], of course); but intuitively, the ability to
overflow a buffer with a large number of null bytes while parsing a
null-terminated C string sounds quite unusual.

Luckily for us attackers, the bytes that are written out-of-bounds by
parse_tunables() are also read out-of-bounds (at line 234), but not from
the mmap()ed copy of our GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable (tunestr),
but from our original GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable in the stack
(valstring, at line 200). Consequently, if we store a large number of
empty strings (null bytes) immediately after our GLIBC_TUNABLES in the
stack, followed by the string "\x10\xf0\xff\xff\xfd\x7f", followed by
more empty strings (null bytes), then we safely overwrite the link_map
structure with null bytes (NULL pointers), except for l_info[DT_RPATH]
(which we overwrite with 0x7ffdfffff010, which points to our own
Elf64_Dyn structures in the stack with a probability of 1/2730).

Final note: the exploitation method described in this advisory works
against almost all of the SUID-root programs that are installed by
default on Linux; a few exceptions are:

- sudo on all distributions, because it specifies its own ELF RUNPATH
  (/usr/libexec/sudo), which overrides our l_info[DT_RPATH];

- chage and passwd on Fedora, because they are protected by special
  SELinux rules;

- snap-confine on Ubuntu, because it is protected by special AppArmor
  rules.

Last-minute note: although glibc 2.34 is vulnerable to this buffer
overflow, its tunables_strdup() uses __sbrk(), not __minimal_malloc()
(which was introduced in glibc 2.35 by commit b05fae, "elf: Use the
minimal malloc on tunables_strdup"); we have not yet investigated
whether glibc 2.34 is exploitable or not.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including

                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-2b8c11ee75
2023-10-04 15:50:14.488670
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.37
Release : 10.fc38
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fix for CVE-2023-4911, CVE-2023-4806, and CVE-2023-4527.
CVE-2023-4911: If a tunable of the form NAME=NAME=VAL is passed in the
environment of a setuid program and NAME is valid, it may result in a buffer
overflow, which could be exploited to achieve escalated privileges. This flaw
was introduced in glibc 2.34. CVE-2023-4806: When an NSS plugin only implements
the \_gethostbyname2\_r and \_getcanonname\_r callbacks, getaddrinfo could use
memory that was freed during buffer resizing, potentially causing a crash or
read or write to arbitrary memory. CVE-2023-4527: If the system is configured
in no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, getaddrinfo is called for the AF\_UNSPEC
address family, and a DNS response is received over TCP that is larger than 2048
bytes, getaddrinfo may potentially disclose stack contents via the returned
address data, or crash. ---- This update contains [changes to ELF destructor
ordering](<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30869>), improving
compatibility with a certain VPN software product.

Subject: Re: CVE-2023-4911: Local Privilege Escalation in the glibc's ld.so

Hi,

Thanks Qualys for the impressive research on this, as is usual for you.
Also thank you to the upstream maintainer Siddhesh Poyarekar for staying
on top of this issue.

This is now fixed in upstream glibc:

For those wondering, the preceding related commit is _not_ part of the
security fix, as we discussed privately:

(It actually re-exposes the risky functionality somewhat more.)

RHEL 8 includes a backport of the problematic commit 2ed18c5b534d in
glibc-rh1934155-6.patch starting with:

* Wed Apr 14 2021 Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@...hat.com> - 2.28-157
- Consistently SXID_ERASE tunables in sxid binaries (#1934155)

So RHEL (rebuild) distros of both RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 contain the bug.
However, Qualys' specific exploitation method shouldn't work against
them.  It is not currently known whether another exploitation method
exists that would work on pre-2.35 glibc such as RHEL's backports.

The one-line reproducer from Qualys:

> $ env -i "GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.mxfast=glibc.malloc.mxfast=A" "Z=`printf '%08192x' 1`" /usr/bin/su --help

does cause a segfault on (rebuilds of) both RHEL 8 and 9 that I tested.

Besides the proper upstream fix, a mitigation is to exclude tunables
support for SUID/SGID programs, which ALT Linux did in:

<https://git.altlinux.org/gears/g/glibc.git?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=5d1686416ab766f3dd0780ab730650c4c0f76ca9>

I briefly tested my port of this (along with the rest of ALT Linux's
glibc environment sanitization changes) to a RHEL 9 rebuild modified
glibc package today (as now pushed to Rocky Linux Security SIG repo),
and it seems to work as intended (the reproducer does not segfault
anymore, but another tunable still has effect in my test on an
unprivileged program).

tunables: Terminate if end of input is reached (CVE-2023-4911)

The string parsing routine may end up writing beyond bounds of tunestr

if the input tunable string is malformed, of the form name=name=val.

This gets processed twice, first as name=name=val and next as name=val,

resulting in tunestr being name=name=val:name=val, thus overflowing

tunestr.

Terminate the parsing loop at the first instance itself so that tunestr

does not overflow.

This also fixes up tst-env-setuid-tunables to actually handle failures

correct and add new tests to validate the fix for this CVE.

# CVE-2023-4911 - Looney Tunables

This is a (atm very rough) proof of concept for CVE-2023-4911. So far I've only verified it works on
Ubuntu 22.10 kinetic. Current version of the exploit contains a fair amount of "magic" offsets. If you have suggestions
on how to improve the heap shaping, feel free to send a PR my way :).

This exploit is basically an implementation of [Qualys' excellent write up](https://www.qualys.com/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4911/looney-tunables-local-privilege-escalation-glibc-ld-so.txt). It deviates in
some places. That's not necessarily because I think I know better, this is just what worked on
my VM. There is probably room for improvement.

## Usage

1. Compile the exploit and suid library using `make`.
2. Run `./exploit` from a writable directory, containing both `suid_lib.so` and `exploit`. It'll create a folder called `U` in the current
   directory and populate it with the necessary libraries.

In my limited testing, the exploit needs somewhere between 4000-8000 attempts. The stack spray is not quite as good as Qualys' implementation, so it takes a bit longer.

Here's an example of the exploit in action (sped up): <https://youtu.be/uw0EJ5zGEKE>

## Improvement ideas

If you feel like hacking on this, here are some ideas to get you started:

* Make it self-contained. See <https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit> for inspiration.
* Make the heap shaping more robust. Right now it's very fragile and depends on a lot of magic
  offsets.
* Make it work on more distros.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# PoC of CVE-2023-4911 "Looney Tunables"

This is a PoC of CVE-2023-4911 (a.k.a. "Looney Tunables") exploiting a bug in glibc dynamic loader's `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variable parsing function `parse_tunables()`.

Code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 with glibc version `2.35-0ubuntu3.3`. No attempts have been made to generalize the PoC (read: "Works On My Machine"), so your mileage may vary.

As always, big kudos to the [Qualys Threat Research Unit](https://www.qualys.com/tru/) for the discovery of the vulnerability and for the [very detailed writeup](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q4/18).

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

Qualys Security Advisory
Looney Tunables: Local Privilege Escalation in the glibc's ld.so
(CVE-2023-4911)

Summary
========================================================================
The GNU C Library's dynamic loader "find[s] and load[s] the shared
objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare[s] the program
to run, and then run[s] it" (man ld.so). The dynamic loader is extremely
security sensitive, because its code runs with elevated privileges when
a local user executes a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or
a program with capabilities. Historically, the processing of environment
variables such as LD\_PRELOAD, LD\_AUDIT, and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH has been a
fertile source of vulnerabilities in the dynamic loader.
Recently, we discovered a vulnerability (a buffer overflow) in the
dynamic loader's processing of the GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html\_node/Tunables.html). This
vulnerability was introduced in April 2021 (glibc 2.34) by commit 2ed18c
("Fix SXID\_ERASE behavior in setuid programs (BZ #27471)").
We successfully exploited this vulnerability and obtained full root
privileges on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu
22.04 and 23.04, Debian 12 and 13; other distributions are probably also
vulnerable and exploitable (one notable exception is Alpine Linux, which
uses musl libc, not the glibc). We will not publish our exploit for now;
however, this buffer overflow is easily exploitable (by transforming it
into a data-only attack), and other researchers might publish working
exploits shortly after this coordinated disclosure.
========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================
At the very beginning of its execution, ld.so calls \_\_tunables\_init() to
walk through the environment (at line 279), searching for GLIBC\_TUNABLES
variables (at line 282); for each GLIBC\_TUNABLES that it finds, it makes
a copy of this variable (at line 284), calls parse\_tunables() to process
and sanitize this copy (at line 286), and finally replaces the original
GLIBC\_TUNABLES with this sanitized copy (at line 288):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
269 void
270 \_\_tunables\_init (char \*\*envp)
271 {
272 char \*envname = NULL;
273 char \*envval = NULL;
274 size\_t len = 0;
275 char \*\*prev\_envp = envp;
...
279 while ((envp = get\_next\_env (envp, &envname, &len, &envval,
280 &prev\_envp)) != NULL)
281 {
282 if (tunable\_is\_name ("GLIBC\_TUNABLES", envname))
283 {
284 char \*new\_env = tunables\_strdup (envname);
285 if (new\_env != NULL)
286 parse\_tunables (new\_env + len + 1, envval);
287 /\* Put in the updated envval. \*/
288 \*prev\_envp = new\_env;
289 continue;
290 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first argument of parse\_tunables() (tunestr) points to the
soon-to-be-sanitized copy of GLIBC\_TUNABLES, while the second argument
(valstring) points to the original GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable
(in the stack). To sanitize the copy of GLIBC\_TUNABLES (which should be
of the form "tunable1=aaa:tunable2=bbb"), parse\_tunables() removes all
dangerous tunables (the SXID\_ERASE tunables) from tunestr, but keeps
SXID\_IGNORE and NONE tunables (at lines 221-235):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
162 static void
163 parse\_tunables (char \*tunestr, char \*valstring)

203 while (p[len] != ':' && p[len] != '\0')
204 len++;
205
206 /\* Add the tunable if it exists. \*/
207 for (size\_t i = 0; i < sizeof (tunable\_list) / sizeof (tunable\_t); i++)
208 {
209 tunable\_t \*cur = &tunable\_list[i];
210
211 if (tunable\_is\_name (cur->name, name))
212 {
...
219 if (\_\_libc\_enable\_secure)
220 {
221 if (cur->security\_level != TUNABLE\_SECLEVEL\_SXID\_ERASE)
222 {
223 if (off > 0)
224 tunestr[off++] = ':';
225
226 const char \*n = cur->name;
227
228 while (\*n != '\0')
229 tunestr[off++] = \*n++;
230
231 tunestr[off++] = '=';
232
233 for (size\_t j = 0; j < len; j++)
234 tunestr[off++] = value[j];
235 }
236
237 if (cur->security\_level != TUNABLE\_SECLEVEL\_NONE)
238 break;
239 }
240
241 value[len] = '\0';
242 tunable\_initialize (cur, value);
243 break;
244 }
245 }
246
247 if (p[len] != '\0')
248 p += len + 1;
249 }
250 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, if a GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable is of the form
"tunable1=tunable2=AAA" (where "tunable1" and "tunable2" are SXID\_IGNORE
tunables, for example "glibc.malloc.mxfast"), then:
- during the first iteration of the "while (true)" in parse\_tunables(),
the entire "tunable1=tunable2=AAA" is copied in-place to tunestr (at
lines 221-235), thus filling up tunestr;
- at lines 247-248, p is not incremented (p[len] is '\0' because no ':'
was found at lines 203-204) and therefore p still points to the value
of "tunable1", i.e. "tunable2=AAA";
- during the second iteration of the "while (true)" in parse\_tunables(),
"tunable2=AAA" is appended (as if it were a second tunable) to tunestr
(which is already full), thus overflowing tunestr.
A note on fuzzing: although we discovered this buffer overflow manually,
we later tried to fuzz the vulnerable function, parse\_tunables(); both
AFL++ and libFuzzer re-discovered this overflow in less than a second,
when provided with a dictionary of tunables (which can be compiled by
running "ld.so --list-tunables").

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================
This vulnerability is a straightforward buffer overflow, but what should
we overwrite to achieve arbitrary code execution? The buffer we overflow
is allocated at line 284 by tunables\_strdup(), a re-implementation of
strdup() that uses ld.so's \_\_minimal\_malloc() instead of the glibc's
malloc() (indeed, the glibc's malloc() has not been initialized yet).
This \_\_minimal\_malloc() implementation simply calls mmap() to obtain
more memory from the kernel.
The question, then, is: what writable pages can we overwrite in the mmap
region? To the best of our knowledge, we have only two options (because
this buffer overflow takes place at the very beginning of ld.so's
execution):
1/ The read-write ELF segment of ld.so itself (the first pages of this
read-write segment are actually ld.so's RELRO segment, but they have not
been mprotect()ed read-only yet):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
7f209f367000-7f209f369000 r--p 00000000 fd:00 10943 /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f369000-7f209f393000 r-xp 00002000 fd:00 10943 /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f393000-7f209f39e000 r--p 0002c000 fd:00 10943 /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7f209f39f000-7f209f3a3000 rw-p 00037000 fd:00 10943 /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, on all the Linux distributions that we checked, the unmapped
hole immediately below ld.so's read-write segment is at most one page,
but ld.so's \_\_minimal\_malloc() always allocates at least two pages ("one
extra page to reduce number of mmap calls"). In other words, the buffer
we overflow cannot be allocated immediately below ld.so's read-write
segment, and therefore cannot overwrite this segment.
2/ Our only option, then, is to overwrite mmap()ed pages that were
allocated by tunables\_strdup() itself: because \_\_tunables\_init() can
process multiple GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variables, and because the
Linux kernel's mmap() is a top-down allocator, we can mmap() a first
GLIBC\_TUNABLES (without overflowing it), mmap() a second GLIBC\_TUNABLES
(immediately below the first one) and overflow it, thus overwriting the
first GLIBC\_TUNABLES. As a result, we can:
- either replace this first GLIBC\_TUNABLES with a completely different
environment variable, for example LD\_PRELOAD or LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH -- but
these dangerous variables are later removed from the environment by
ld.so (in process\_envvars()), and such a replacement would therefore
be useless;
- or replace the first GLIBC\_TUNABLES with a GLIBC\_TUNABLES that
contains dangerous (SXID\_ERASE) tunables, which were previously
removed by parse\_tunables() -- although this seems promising at first,
exploiting such a replacement would require a SUID-root program that
setuid(0)s and execve()s another program with a preserved environment
(to process the dangerous GLIBC\_TUNABLES as root, but without
\_\_libc\_enable\_secure).
Alas, we do not know of such a SUID-root program on Linux (on OpenBSD,
/usr/bin/chpass setuid(0)s and execv()s /usr/sbin/pwd\_mkdb, and was
exploited in CVE-2019-19726); if you, dear reader, know of such a
SUID-root program on Linux, please let us know!
At that point, the situation looked quite hopeless, but a comment in
ld.so's \_dl\_new\_object() (which is called long after \_\_tunables\_init())
caught our attention (at line 105):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
56 struct link\_map \*
57 \_dl\_new\_object (char \*realname, const char \*libname, int type,
58 struct link\_map \*loader, int mode, Lmid\_t nsid)
59 {
..
84 struct link\_map \*new;
85 struct libname\_list \*newname;
..
92 new = (struct link\_map \*) calloc (sizeof (\*new) + audit\_space
93 + sizeof (struct link\_map \*)
94 + sizeof (\*newname) + libname\_len, 1);
95 if (new == NULL)
96 return NULL;
97
98 new->l\_real = new;
99 new->l\_symbolic\_searchlist.r\_list = (struct link\_map \*\*) ((char \*) (new + 1)
100 + audit\_space);
101
102 new->l\_libname = newname
103 = (struct libname\_list \*) (new->l\_symbolic\_searchlist.r\_list + 1);
104 newname->name = (char \*) memcpy (newname + 1, libname, libname\_len);
105 /\* newname->next = NULL; We use calloc therefore not necessary. \*/
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ld.so allocates the memory for this link\_map structure with calloc(),
and therefore does not explicitly initialize various of its members to
zero; this is a reasonable optimization. As mentioned earlier, calloc()
here is not the glibc's calloc() but ld.so's \_\_minimal\_calloc(), which
calls \_\_minimal\_malloc() \*without\* explicitly initializing the memory it
returns to zero; this is also a reasonable optimization, because for all
intents and purposes \_\_minimal\_malloc() always returns a clean chunk of
mmap()ed memory, which is guaranteed to be initialized to zero by the
kernel.
Unfortunately, the buffer overflow in parse\_tunables() allows us to
overwrite clean mmap()ed memory with non-zero bytes, thereby overwriting
pointers of the soon-to-be-allocated link\_map structure with non-NULL
values. This allows us to completely break the logic of ld.so, which
assumes that these pointers are NULL.
We first tried to exploit this buffer overflow by overwriting the
link\_map structure's l\_next and l\_prev pointers (a doubly linked list of
link\_map structures), but we failed because of two assert()ion failures
in setup\_vdso(), which immediately abort() ld.so (all the distributions
that we checked compile their glibc, and hence ld.so, with assert()ions
enabled):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
96 assert (l->l\_next == NULL);
97 assert (l->l\_prev == main\_map);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We then realized that many more pointers in the link\_map structure are
not explicitly initialized to NULL; in particular, the pointers to
Elf64\_Dyn structures in the l\_info[] array of pointers. Among these,
l\_info[DT\_RPATH], the "Library search path", immediately stood out: if
we overwrite this pointer and control where and what it points to, then
we can force ld.so to trust a directory that we own, and therefore to
load our own libc.so.6 or LD\_PRELOAD library from this directory, and
execute arbitrary code (as root, if we run ld.so through a SUID-root
program).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where should the overwritten l\_info[DT\_RPATH] point to? The easy answer
to this question is: the stack; more precisely, our environment strings
in the stack. On Linux, the stack is randomized in a 16GB region, and
our environment strings can occupy up to 6MB (\_STK\_LIM / 4 \* 3, in the
kernel's bprm\_stack\_limits()): after 16GB / 6MB = 2730 tries we have a
good chance of guessing the address of our environment strings (in our
exploit, we always overwrite l\_info[DT\_RPATH] with 0x7ffdfffff010, the
center of the randomized stack region). In our tests, this brute force
takes ~30s on Debian, and ~5m on Ubuntu and Fedora (because of their
automatic crash handlers, Apport and ABRT; we have not tried to work
around this slowdown).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should the overwritten l\_info[DT\_RPATH] point to? In other words,
what should we store in our 6MB of environment strings? l\_info[DT\_RPATH]
is a pointer to a small (16B) Elf64\_Dyn structure:
- an int64\_t d\_tag, which should be DT\_RPATH (15), but this value is
never actually checked anywhere, so we can store anything there;
- a uint64\_t d\_val, which is an offset into the ELF string table of the
SUID-root program that is being executed (this offset references a
string that is the "Library search path" itself).
In our exploit, we simply fill our 6MB of environment strings with
0xfffffffffffffff8 (-8), because at an offset of -8B below the string
table of most SUID-root programs, the string "\x08" appears: this forces
ld.so to trust a relative directory named "\x08" (in our current working
directory), and therefore allows us to load and execute our own
libc.so.6 or LD\_PRELOAD library from this directory, as root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
One major problem remains unsolved, however: to avoid the kind of
assert()ion failures mentioned earlier (when we tried to overwrite the
l\_next and l\_prev pointers of the link\_map structure), we must overwrite
the soon-to-be-allocated link\_map structure with NULL pointers only
(except l\_info[DT\_RPATH], of course); but intuitively, the ability to
overflow a buffer with a large number of null bytes while parsing a
null-terminated C string sounds quite unusual.
Luckily for us attackers, the bytes that are written out-of-bounds by
parse\_tunables() are also read out-of-bounds (at line 234), but not from
the mmap()ed copy of our GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable (tunestr),
but from our original GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable in the stack
(valstring, at line 200). Consequently, if we store a large number of
empty strings (null bytes) immediately after our GLIBC\_TUNABLES in the
stack, followed by the string "\x10\xf0\xff\xff\xfd\x7f", followed by
more empty strings (null bytes), then we safely overwrite the link\_map
structure with null bytes (NULL pointers), except for l\_info[DT\_RPATH]
(which we overwrite with 0x7ffdfffff010, which points to our own
Elf64\_Dyn structures in the stack with a probability of 1/2730).
Final note: the exploitation method described in this advisory works
against almost all of the SUID-root programs that are installed by
default on Linux; a few exceptions are:
- sudo on all distributions, because it specifies its own ELF RUNPATH
(/usr/libexec/sudo), which overrides our l\_info[DT\_RPATH];
- chage and passwd on Fedora, because they are protected by special
SELinux rules;
- snap-confine on Ubuntu, because it is protected by special AppArmor
rules.
Last-minute note: although glibc 2.34 is vulnerable to this buffer
overflow, its tunables\_strdup() uses \_\_sbrk(), not \_\_minimal\_malloc()
(which was introduced in glibc 2.35 by commit b05fae, "elf: Use the
minimal malloc on tunables\_strdup"); we have not yet investigated
whether glibc 2.34 is exploitable or not.

The [Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)](https://www.qualys.com/tru/) has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in GNU C Library’s dynamic loader’s processing of the GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable. We have successfully identified and exploited this vulnerability (a local privilege escalation that grants full root privileges) on the default installations of Fedora 37 and 38, Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.04, and Debian 12 and 13. It’s likely that other distributions are similarly susceptible, although we’ve noted that Alpine Linux remains an exception due to its use of musl libc instead of glibc. This vulnerability was introduced in April 2021.

Considering the identified vulnerability in the GNU C Library’s dynamic loader and its potential impact on systems, the Qualys Threat Research Unit advises security teams to prioritize patching this issue.

## **About GNU C Library’s dynamic loader**

The GNU C Library, commonly known as glibc, is the C library in the GNU system and in most systems running the Linux kernel. It defines the system calls and other basic functionalities, such as open, malloc, printf, exit, etc., that a typical program requires. The GNU C Library’s dynamic loader is a crucial component of glibc responsible for preparing and running programs. When a program is initiated, this loader first examines the program to determine the shared libraries it requires. It then searches for these libraries, loads them into memory, and links them with the executable at runtime. In the process, the dynamic loader resolves symbol references, such as function and variable references, ensuring that everything is set for the program’s execution. Given its role, the dynamic loader is highly security-sensitive, as its code runs with elevated privileges when a local user launches a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program.

**GLIBC\_TUNABLES Environment Variable:**

The GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable was introduced in glibc to offer users the ability to modify the library’s behavior at runtime, eliminating the need to recompile either the application or the library. By setting GLIBC\_TUNABLES, users can adjust various performance and behavior parameters, which are then applied upon application startup.

## **Potential Impact of Looney Tunables**

The presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the dynamic loader’s handling of the GLIBC\_TUNABLES environment variable poses significant risks to numerous Linux distributions. This environment variable, intended to fine-tune and optimize applications linked with glibc, is an essential tool for developers and system administrators. Its misuse or exploitation broadly affects system performance, reliability, and security.

Our successful exploitation, leading to full root privileges on major distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian, highlights this vulnerability’s severity and widespread nature. Although we are withholding our exploit code for now, the ease with which the buffer overflow can be transformed into a data-only attack implies that other research teams could soon produce and release exploits. This could put countless systems at risk, especially given the extensive use of glibc across Linux distributions. While certain distributions like Alpine Linux are exempt due to their use of musl libc instead of glibc, many popular distributions are potentially vulnerable and could be exploited in the near future.

## **Disclosure Timeline**

* 2023-09-04: Advisory and exploit sent to secalert@redhat.
* 2023-09-19: Advisory and patch sent to linux-distros@openwall.
* 2023-10-03: Coordinated Release Date (17:00 UTC).

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the recent discovery by the Qualys Threat Research Unit of a buffer overflow in the GNU C Library’s dynamic loader is a pressing concern for many Linux distributions. With the capability to provide full root access on popular platforms like Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian, it’s imperative for system administrators to act swiftly. While Alpine Linux users can breathe a sigh of relief, others should prioritize patching to ensure system integrity and security.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2023%3A5455)

## Topic

An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* glibc: buffer overflow in ld.so leading to privilege escalation (CVE-2023-4911)
* glibc: Stack read overflow in getaddrinfo in no-aaaa mode (CVE-2023-4527)
* glibc: potential use-after-free in getaddrinfo() (CVE-2023-4806)
* glibc: potential use-after-free in gaih\_inet() (CVE-2023-4813)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the glibc library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
