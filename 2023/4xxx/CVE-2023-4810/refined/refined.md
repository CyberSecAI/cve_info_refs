Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Responsive Pricing Table" WordPress plugin failing to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the "Short description" field when creating a pricing table. This allows malicious script to be stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that the malicious script is saved into the database and executed each time an affected page is rendered to a user.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the user-provided input, specifically the "Short description" field of a pricing table, before storing it in the database.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The stored malicious script is not encoded or escaped when rendered in the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser session.
- **User Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control over the victim's account by stealing cookies, capturing passwords, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to redirect users to phishing websites, inject advertisements, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is launched through the plugin's web interface via the admin panel when creating/editing a pricing table. Specifically, the "Short description" input field is used to inject the malicious payload.
- **Data Storage:** The injected script is stored persistently in the website's database, making it a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges (or other high privilege user such as admin) to access the plugin's settings and create or edit pricing tables.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the "Short description" field is vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Additional Details**
- **Affected Plugin:** The vulnerability specifically affects the "Responsive Pricing Table" plugin with versions prior to 5.1.8.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.1.8 of the plugin.
