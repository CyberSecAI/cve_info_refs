**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or improper nonce validation within the `eae_save_config` function of the Elementor Addon Elements WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-  **Impact on Functionality**: The specific impact depends on the settings the attacker manipulates, which could range from minor visual changes to more significant alterations of site functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged HTTP Requests:** Attackers can craft malicious HTTP requests targeting the `eae_save_config` function.
- **Social Engineering:** Successful exploitation requires tricking a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing some other action that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** No authentication is required for the initial attack.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs the capability to trick an administrator into performing a specific action (e.g., clicking a link).
