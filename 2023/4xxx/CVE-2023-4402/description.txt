The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 4.2.0 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_products function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
