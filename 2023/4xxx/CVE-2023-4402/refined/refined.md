Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4402

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted input within the `get_products` function of the Essential Blocks plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses `maybe_unserialize()` on the `query_data` parameter from the request, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject a PHP object through the `query_data` parameter due to the use of `maybe_unserialize()`.
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core issue is the plugin's reliance on `maybe_unserialize()` to handle user-supplied data without proper validation or sanitization, leading to potential object injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Direct Impact (Plugin):** The plugin itself does not contain a readily available POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain that an attacker can utilize.
- **Indirect Impact (System):** If a POP chain is present in another plugin or theme installed on the same WordPress system, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:
    - Delete arbitrary files
    - Retrieve sensitive information
    - Execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network, as it exploits a REST API endpoint.
- **Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- The attacker must be able to provide a serialized PHP object payload within the `query_data` parameter of the REST API request.
- The attacker may need to identify an existing POP chain from other plugins or themes on the target system to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Essential Blocks plugin versions up to and including 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability also exists in Essential Blocks Pro versions up to and including 1.1.0.
- The issue was fixed in Essential Blocks version 4.2.1 and Essential Blocks Pro version 1.1.1.
