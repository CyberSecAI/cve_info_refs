Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-4723:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The Wordfence description directly mentions `CVE-2023-4723` and states that the "Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.12.7 via the ajax\_eae\_post\_data function". This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.
   - The provided code diff from the plugin's `helper.php` also contains changes related to the `ajax_eae_post_data` function. 

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** in the `ajax_eae_post_data` function.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Missing Authorization:** The `ajax_eae_post_data` function lacks proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger it.
   - **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerable function is designed to fetch post data, but due to the missing authorization, it allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive information, such as post/page IDs and titles. This includes posts with pending, draft, future, or private statuses.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information about the website's content structure, including details of unpublished content.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Direct Access to AJAX Endpoint:** Attackers can directly call the `ajax_eae_post_data` AJAX endpoint without any prior authentication or authorization.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

  - **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication or special user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
  - **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site's AJAX endpoint, which is accessible over the network.

**Additional details beyond official CVE description:**

   - The provided Wordfence analysis details the vulnerable function (`ajax_eae_post_data`) and the type of data it exposes (post/page IDs and titles, including those with private status). This is more detailed than the initial "Sensitive Information Exposure" statement.
   - The code diff of `helper.php` shows that the vulnerable function was indeed modified and nonce check added to `ajax_eae_refresh_insta_cache` function. The changeset also indicates that other files were modified, and this release constitutes version 1.12.8 of the plugin, which addresses the vulnerability.
