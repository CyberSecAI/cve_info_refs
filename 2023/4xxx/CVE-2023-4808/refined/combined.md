## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Post Popup <= 3.7.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its inputs, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Enter the following payload in the Close Button field in the plugin settings.
`<img src=s onerror=alert("XSS")>`
Save the settings and visit the homepage to see the XSS.
