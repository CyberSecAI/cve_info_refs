## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 123.chat < 1.3.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin's "User-ID" setting field, enter the payload:
"></script><script>alert("XSS")</script>
Save the changes and see the XSS.
