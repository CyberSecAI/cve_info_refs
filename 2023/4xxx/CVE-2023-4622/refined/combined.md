af\_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix\_stream\_sendpage().Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix\_stream\_sendpage()
with detailed analysis and a nice repro.
unix\_stream\_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's
recv queue without locking the queue.
If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is
passed to the peer, there is a loop between them. If we close both
sockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage
collection.
The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with
FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.
So, there is a race where unix\_stream\_sendpage() could access an skb
locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in
use-after-free.
To avoid the issue, unix\_stream\_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv
queue.
Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()
refactoring.
This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.

Debian Bug     : 871216 1035359 1036543 1044518 1050622

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller
    driver. A local user with access to a SCSI device using this
    driver could exploit this for privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the
    device mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-2898

    It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file system
    may result in denial of service if a malformed file system is
    accessed.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver
    that can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an
    unprivileged user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3141

    A flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
    could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference
    when mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-3389

    Querijn Voet discovered a use-after-free in the io_uring

CVE-2023-6932

    A use-after-free vulnerability in the IPv4 IGMP implementation may
    result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-25775

    Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail and Shiraz
    Saleem discovered that improper access control in the Intel Ethernet
    Controller RDMA driver may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-34319

    Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
    which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
    virtualisation host by sending malformed packets.

CVE-2023-34324

    Marek Marczykowski-Gorecki reported a possible deadlock in the Xen
    guests event channel code which may allow a malicious guest
    administrator to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-39189, CVE-2023-39192, CVE-2023-39193

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported missing
    bounds checks in the nfnetlink_osf, xt_u32, and xt_sctp netfilter
    modules.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace could exploit these to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel or for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-39194

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported a missing
    bounds check in the xfrm (IPsec) subsystem.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace could
    exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel or for
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-40283

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket
    handling.

CVE-2023-42753

    Kyle Zeng discovered an off-by-one error in the netfilter ipset
    subsystem which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or
    network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) and possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-42754

    Kyle Zeng discovered a flaw in the IPv4 implementation which could
    lead to a null pointer deference.  A local user could exploit this
    for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-42755

    Kyle Zeng discovered missing configuration validation in the
    cls_rsvp network classifier which could lead to out-of-bounds
    reads.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to leak sensitive information.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the cls_rsvp classifier.

CVE-2023-45863

    A race condition in library routines for handling generic kernel
    objects may result in an out-of-bounds write in the
    fill_kobj_path() function.

CVE-2023-45871

    Manfred Rudigier reported a flaw in the igb network driver for
    Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  When the "rx-all" feature was
    enabled on such a network interface, an attacker on the same
    network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive
    buffer, leading to a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly remote code execution.

CVE-2023-51780

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Appletalk subsystem
    may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51782

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Amateur Radio X.25
    PLP (Rose) support may lead to a use-after-free. This module is not
    auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems
    where it is explicitly loaded.
