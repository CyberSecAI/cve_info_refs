- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate the "Serialized PHP array" input data before deserializing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization of user-supplied data. Specifically, the plugin deserializes a PHP array from user-controlled input without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a suitable gadget chain is present on the server. This means an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrator privileges can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector involves providing a malicious serialized PHP object through the "Serialized PHP array" input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator within the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to access the wpDataTables plugin settings and have the ability to create a table linked to a data source.
