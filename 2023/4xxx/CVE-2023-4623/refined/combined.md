Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller

    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-40283

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket
    handling.

CVE-2023-42753

    Kyle Zeng discovered an off-by-one error in the netfilter ipset
    subsystem which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or
    network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) and possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-42754

    Kyle Zeng discovered a flaw in the IPv4 implementation which could
    lead to a null pointer deference.  A local user could exploit this
    for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-42755

    Kyle Zeng discovered missing configuration validation in the
    cls_rsvp network classifier which could lead to out-of-bounds
    reads.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to leak sensitive information.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the cls_rsvp classifier.

CVE-2023-45863

    A race condition in library routines for handling generic kernel
    objects may result in an out-of-bounds write in the
    fill_kobj_path() function.

CVE-2023-45871

    Manfred Rudigier reported a flaw in the igb network driver for
    Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  When the "rx-all" feature was
    enabled on such a network interface, an attacker on the same
    network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive
    buffer, leading to a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly remote code execution.

CVE-2023-51780

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Appletalk subsystem
    may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51782

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Amateur Radio X.25
    PLP (Rose) support may lead to a use-after-free. This module is not
    auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems
    where it is explicitly loaded.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.304-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes
from stable updates 4.19.290-4.19.304 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

net/sched: sch\_hfsc: Ensure inner classes have fsc curveHFSC assumes that inner classes have an fsc curve, but it is currently
possible for classes without an fsc curve to become parents. This leads
to bugs including a use-after-free.
Don't allow non-root classes without HFSC\_FSC to become parents.
