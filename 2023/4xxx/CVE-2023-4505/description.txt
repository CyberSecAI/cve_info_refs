The Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to LDAP Passback in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to insufficient validation when changing the LDAP server. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative access and above, to change the LDAP server and retrieve the credentials for the original LDAP server.
