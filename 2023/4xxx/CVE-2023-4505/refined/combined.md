### Description

The Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to LDAP Passback in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to insufficient validation when changing the LDAP server. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative access and above, to change the LDAP server and retrieve the credentials for the original LDAP server.

# **TLDR**

I found two LDAP passback vulnerabilities on miniorange LDAP plugins.

# About miniorange plugins

The Staff/Employee Business Directory for Active Directory plugin is used to perform an LDAP search and display the Staff / Employees present in your Active Directory on a WordPress site using a shortcode. The users / staff / employee details will be fetched from the Active Directory dynamically. That means the users will not be created in WordPress, and neither will their information be stored. The plugin will seamlessly allow you to perform a Staff / Employee search through your business directory, employee directory, staff directory, or any other Active Directory implementations from your WordPress site and display the information you would like to see.

## Plugins affected

* Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites WordPress
* Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory

# Overview

Some time ago while learning some attack techniques related to Active Directory I discovered the concept of LDAP pass back and incorporated it into my testing repertoire.

About a month ago I found an asset inside a bugbounty program that made use of a Wordpress plugin to perform authentication over LDAP and I decided to install it to test if I found any exploitable vulnerability in the context of the program.

While the only thing that fell within the scope of it was an information disclosure, I found a number of extra vulnerabilities that could exploit an attacker as is the case of these two LDAP pass backs.

**What is LDAP Pass-Back?**

LDAP Pass-Back is an attack that exploits how some systems authenticate users to a directory service such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

Generally, even from the administration panel of devices that use LDAP for authentication is not possible to recover the password of the LDAP account used for authentication. This attack exploits the possibility of changing the host against which the device tries to authenticate by making it authenticate against a system controlled by the attacker, thus obtaining the credentials used by the application.

# PoC

**Active Directory Integration for Intranet Sites Wordpress (CVE-2023–4506)**

Firstly this is the configuration panel accessible from the plugin interface, the entry point we are interested in this case is the one of the URL:

![]()

An attacker after accessing the service by any means could change this URL to a rogue LDAP server set up by him, where he could retrieve the credentials in plain text.

![]()

To setup it we can either set up an LDAP server from scratch on a VPS, or we can use this dockerized version that I uploaded a few months ago to GitHub (<https://github.com/pedrojosenavasperez/ldap-passback-docker>)
Once deployed on the server controlled by the attacker, we only have to test the connection with the button provided by the plugin, and we will see how the credentials in plain text reach the server controlled by the attacker.

![]()

**Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory (CVE-2023–4505)**

Quite similar to the previous one

![]()

An attacker after accessing the service by any means could change this URL to a rogue LDAP server set up by him, where he could retrieve the credentials in plain text.

![]()

When we hit “Test Connection”, we get the credentials in plain text in our rogue LDAP server.

![]()
# Solution

At this point miniorange has decided not to patch the vulnerability despite a long thread of communications with them explaining the problem and proposing solutions.

According to them, an attacker with access to WordPress should be able to access LDAP as well and the only mitigation they propose is to disable LDAP in favor of LDAPS on the network, which does not provide any protection against this attack.

## FAQ

### Why am I getting an error while trying to Test LDAP Connection?

1. Please make sure that the LDAP Server URL, Username and Password that you have entered are correct.
2. In the Username field, please enter either the UserPrincipalName or DistinguishedName (DN) attribute of any user present in your LDAP server.
3. Check if the LDAP server URL is accessible from your hosted site and the port 389 is open. { To check this, run this command on your WordPress server: >telnet < LDAP server URL or IP >:389 }
4. If you are using a firewall, open the firewall to allow incoming requests to your LDAP from your WordPress Server IP and port 389.

If you have any queries or if you need any sort of assistance configuring our plugin, you can contact us at ldapsupport@xecurify.com. Our customer support team is available 24×7 to assist you in any way possible.

### What is meant by Search Base in my LDAP environment?

1. Search Base is a container / path where your LDAP/AD users that you want to search are present.
2. This is the container in which the Staff/Employee Business Directory For Active Directory Plugin will search for LDAP users.
3. The Search Base value can be obtained from the distinguishedName attribute of a container / node where the LDAP/AD users are present.

For example, if you want to search all LDAP/AD users in the Organizational Unit (OU) named “LDAPUsers. The Search Base would be OU=LDAPUsers, DC=DomainName, DC=SubDomainName.

If you have any queries or if you need any sort of assistance in configuring our plugin, you can contact us at ldapsupport@xecurify.com. Our customer support team is available 24×7 to assist you in any way possible.

### I can not add more LDAP user attributes in the Attributes Configuration. Why?

To add and display unlimited LDAP user attributes, please upgrade your existing plan to the premium plan.

### Is it possible to display only active (non-disabled) users from the LDAP/AD Server?

Yes, It is possible using the custom search Filter feature, which is present in the premium version of our plugin.

### How does the Custom Search Filter work?

Custom LDAP search filters allow you to apply advanced filters to your search. You can restrict / allow specific users belonging to LDAP groups or Organizational Units. For Example, If you want to display users from Sales Department, then you can do this using the below search filter:

(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)(sAMAccountName=?)(department=’Sales’))

We use the Staff / Employee Business Directory plugin for our intranet and needed a special configuration that deviates from the standard. We also needed a translation and some layout adjustments, so we opted for the premium version and a customisation package. The developers are very competent, helpful and respond quickly without long waiting times. Highly recommended.

Works like a rock! After I took the ldap off in front of the ip address, it started working. Works very smooth.

It’s always great to find a plugin that’s suits very specific needs and easy to handle. I managed to set up and check the basic funcionality in just 15 minutes, even though I’m not an expert in AD, servers, or WordPress.
We decided to go for the premium version, and the support team has been quick to respond and helpful through all process.
