## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Magee Shortcodes <= 2.1.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept
