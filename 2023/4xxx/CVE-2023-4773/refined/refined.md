Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the `wordpress_social_login_meta` shortcode in the WordPress Social Login plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input used in shortcode attributes, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. When a user visits the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers insert the malicious payload within the attributes of the `wordpress_social_login_meta` shortcode. This shortcode is then embedded within a page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level privileges. This allows them to create and modify posts or pages to include the malicious shortcode.
