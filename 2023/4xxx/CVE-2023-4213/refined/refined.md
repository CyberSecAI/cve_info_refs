- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Simplr Registration Form Plus+ plugin allows user-controlled access to objects, bypassing authorization checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers (subscriber level or above) can change arbitrary user passwords, potentially leading to account takeover, including administrator accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by making a request to the affected plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
