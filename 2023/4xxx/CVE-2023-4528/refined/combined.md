In response to security incidents which have impacted other managed file transfer (MFT) providers over the past year, Redwood has significantly increased its security posture across all  File Transfer products.

Recently, an independent cybersecurity firm disclosed to Redwood a vulnerability (CVE-2023-4528) in the JSCAPE binary management service that runs by default on port 10880 and is used by JSCAPE command line utilities and the legacy Java based management API. While most JSCAPE customers do not use this service - rather utilizing the REST administrative interface or command line utilities locally - we believe it essential to share this information with all customers; that's why [we're offering a free trial](/download-jscape-mft-server).

[![JSCAPE Free Trial](https://www.jscape.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FINAL_JSCAPE_CTA_wText_ver2%20(1).png?width=2500&height=525&name=FINAL_JSCAPE_CTA_wText_ver2%20(1).png)](https://www.jscape.com/download-jscape-mft-server)

## What actions were taken by Redwood in response to this vulnerability?

When the vulnerability was disclosed, Redwood’s security and R&D teams acted quickly. Following standard procedures, they initially gathered a deep technical understanding and then worked to develop a patch to eliminate the vulnerability. The patch is now ready, has been through rigorous internal and third-party testing, and is available for customers to deploy.

## Were there any customers impacted by this vulnerability?

We are closely monitoring and communicating with our customers. To our knowledge, none have been exploited. This vulnerability is relevant to customers that have explicitly set up port 10880 to be open to the public internet or who have a compromised internal network which would allow an adversary to exploit from within. After conducting a thorough scan looking for this configuration, we were unable to find any supported JSCAPE customers with 10880 exposed to the public internet. However, we recommend all customers confirm their own configuration in the administrative interface and upgrade to 2023.1.9.

Note: Port 10880 is not exposed in JSCAPE MFTaaS.

## Actions customers need to take:

* Upgrade your instance(s) of MFT Server to version 2023.1.9: To upgrade, please follow the instructions provided in our [online documentation](https://documentation.jscape.com/mftserver2024.2/Content/MFTServer/upgrading_from_version_2_x_to_.htm). Release notes can be found [here](https://documentation.jscape.com/mftserver2024.2/Content/MFTServer/versionhistory.htm#Release_2023.2_-_September_2023).
* **Close port 10880 to the public internet**: Ensure that external/public access to the binary management service port (typically 10880) that is used by JSCAPE command line utilities is blocked. Settings for this port may be found in the administrative interface under Settings > Manager Service > Manager Service. Note: The web-based administrative port, typically running on port 11880 (HTTP) and/or 11443 (HTTPS), is not subject to this vulnerability.

Please take action today to ensure the most secure JSCAPE experience possible.

We thank our customers for their prompt attention to this update. Earning their trust each day is essential and we consider security a pillar of our partnership.  The Redwood support team (support@advsyscon.com) is available 24/7 to support all JSCAPE customers.

  June 18, 2024

  SFTP Public Key Authentication enhances security by allowing users to access SFTP services without passwords, favoring automated transfers. The setup process involves creating a .ssh directory, generating a key pair with ssh-keygen, securing permissions, and copying the public key to the server, ensuring a secure connection without the need for passwords

  ### Active vs. passive FTP Simplified

  min read —
  June 18, 2024

  The difference between active FTP and passive FTP modes lies in how connections are made. In active mode, the client initiates the connection with a PORT command, making the server connect back for data. In passive mode, the client uses a PASV command, gets a server port, and starts the data transfer connection.

  June 18, 2024

  Active-active high availability clusters distribute workloads evenly across all nodes, ensuring optimal load balancing. In contrast, an active-passive setup keeps nodes on standby, activating them only when the primary fails, leading to potential delays. Active-active configurations offer reduced downtime and improved performance, making them the preferred choice for continuous system availability.

## [10 hidden costs of inadequate file transfer security](https://www.jscape.com/blog/10-hidden-costs-of-inadequate-file-transfer-security)

Updated by

[![](https://www.jscape.com/hubfs/10_hidden%20costs%20of%20inadequate%20file%20transfer%20security.png)](https://www.jscape.com/blog/10-hidden-costs-of-inadequate-file-transfer-security)

Advanced secure file transfer solutions, like managed file transfer (MFT) servers, are no doubt more expensive than run-of-the-mill file transfer software. In fact, you can get a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server or even a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server for free.

# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy

[Report a vulnerability](https://rapid7.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=vulnerability_disclosure)

**Rapid7’s Vulnerability Research and Disclosure Principles**

* **We believe in strengthening defense by democratizing access to attacker tooling and knowledge.** One of Rapid7’s unique strengths is our deep knowledge of how attackers work. Our vulnerability research and Metasploit teams strive to make attacker capabilities that would otherwise be used primarily by criminals accessible to all — enabling defenders to understand and prioritize critical vulnerabilities, develop detections and mitigations, and test security controls. Releasing public exploit code and novel research is core to our mission to close the security achievement gap.
* **Public disclosure of vulnerabilities is a critical component of a healthy cybersecurity ecosystem.** Rapid7 practices and advocates for timely public disclosure of vulnerabilities across both third-party products and our own systems and solutions. This includes vulnerabilities we independently discover in our customers’ tech stacks. Through transparent, open, and timely vulnerability disclosures, Rapid7 helps the entire internet protect and defend those assets and services critical to modern civilization.
* **In today’s threat landscape, organizations need timely information about risk in order to make educated choices about protecting their networks — especially during active attacks.** Our coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy includes explicit provisions for speeding up public disclosure in cases where exploitation has been observed in the wild. Vendors often (understandably) act to protect their own businesses and reputations when there are security issues in their products that introduce risk into their downstream customers’ environments. When we know about exploitation in the wild, or when we believe that threat actors may be covertly weaponizing non-public vulnerabilities, our priority is to make customers and the community aware of that risk so they may take action to protect their organizations.

**Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Policy**

In keeping with standard industry practices around Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) (such as [CERT/CC's](https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm), [Google's](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/policy-and-disclosure-2020-edition.html), [ZDI's](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/)), as well as the standards promulgated in [ISO 29147](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) and [ISO 30111](https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html), Rapid7 will typically prepare and publish advisories detailing newly discovered vulnerabilities approximately 60 days after our initial attempts at private disclosure, barring extenuating circumstances (including those outlined below which may warrant different disclosure guidelines). These advisories will be made publicly available via Rapid7’s [blog](/blog/tag/vulnerability-disclosure/) and social media. Depending on the details of the findings, there may also be media engagement.

While coordinated vulnerability disclosure can differ from bug to bug depending on a wide range of circumstances, Rapid7's primary concern is getting vulnerabilities fixed and making affected parties aware of the risks associated with vulnerabilities. In keeping with the principles outlined above, Rapid7 has identified several common types of vulnerabilities, each of which warrants slightly different disclosure guidelines.

Please note, technical vulnerabilities often involve [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and unexpected interactions. Therefore, Rapid7 may modify the timeline for disclosure at our sole discretion due to unique or unpredictable elements of that specific vulnerability.

**All Vulnerabilities (The Default Policy)**

* Rapid7 will confidentially disclose discovered vulnerabilities to the organization that is in the best position to address that vulnerability with a resolution. That organization is the "responsible organization."

+ If the responsible organization is not a [CVE Partner](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), Rapid7 will reserve a CVE ID.

* After 15 days, Rapid7 will inform CERT/CC of the vulnerability with enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue. If the responsible organization has not acknowledged our initial disclosure by this time, Rapid7 will presume they are a "non-responsive responsible organization."
* After 60 days of confidential disclosure to the responsible organization, Rapid7 will publicly disclose vulnerability information, including CVE descriptions, opinions on risk, impact, and mitigation strategies, and enough technical detail to demonstrate the issue (collectively, "vulnerability details"). Rapid7 may involve media outlets in that disclosure.

+ During this 60 day window, Rapid7 expects the responsible organization will develop a resolution and make any update available for affected parties, and Rapid7 will keep CERT/CC apprised of the status of those updates.
+ If the responsible organization is showing consistent good-faith effort to develop and ship an update, but cannot complete this work within 60 days, a 30-day extension may be granted at Rapid7’s sole discretion under the Default Policy (or for any of the enumerated exceptions below).

* If Rapid7 becomes aware that an update was made generally available after reporting the issue to the responsible organization, including [silent patches](/blog/post/2022/06/06/the-hidden-harm-of-silent-patches/) which tend to hijack CVD norms, Rapid7 will aim to publish vulnerability details within 24 hours.
* Issues that are confidentially rediscovered and reported to the responsible organization as duplicates have no bearing on the timeline expectations of this policy.

**Exploited In the Wild***This is the case where we see active exploitation in a production environment, including our own. The goal in these situations is to release critical information about risk as quickly as possible so organizations may take informed action to protect themselves.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* Rapid7 will aim to notify CERT/CC and publish public vulnerability information approximately 72 hours after discovery, regardless of the existence of an update.
* If the vulnerability was found within an organization’s environment, Rapid7 will strive to notify directly affected organizations of the disclosure first.

**Patch Bypasses***This is the case where a vendor believes they fixed an issue, but didn't.*

This policy is identical to the Exploited In the Wild policy but for these changes:

* A new CVE ID will be reserved that references the original CVE ID.
* Rapid7 will inform the responsible organization and CERT/CC concurrently.
* Depending on the nature of the bypass, Rapid7 may release vulnerability details immediately, or up to 45 days after reporting to CERT/CC.

**Cloud/Hosted Vulnerabilities***This is the case where end users or implementors have nothing to fix on their end — fixing the issue requires only one responsible organization to act.*

This policy is identical to the default policy but for these changes:

* A CVE ID will not be reserved by Rapid7.
* If the issue is resolved inside the 60 day coordination window, Rapid7 will assess the value of a public disclosure. If the issue remains unresolved after the coordination window closes, a public disclosure may be issued per the default policy.

**Kinetic Vulnerabilities***These are vulnerabilities that have obvious and direct implications for human health and safety, and are not otherwise present in generally-used technology. Specialized OT and medical technology fall into this category.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will disclose vulnerability details 30 days after the general availability of the update, instead of immediately.

+ If the vulnerability becomes actively exploited in the wild, the Exploited in the Wild policy shall apply instead.

* Rapid7 will coordinate with relevant government agencies that are in a position to work with the responsible organization to develop, distribute and implement updates (including CERT/CC).
* Coordination with CERT/CC and the responsible organization may be extended for up to 180 days. If there is no update available after 180 days, Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details.

**Low-Impact Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities are trivial enough that an exploit would cause safely ignorable consequences to affected production environments, or limited to a single production instance, such as one website not connected to* [*critical infrastructure*](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)*, or extant in only theoretical or very unlikely configurations of affected systems.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will not coordinate with CERT/CC.
* Rapid7 may not publish vulnerability details at any point, but may do so if circumstances change (for example, if it's shown that this low-impact vulnerability can be chained with another to achieve a high-impact result).

**Vulnerabilities with No Responsible Organization***These are vulnerabilities in obsolete systems, abandoned software packages, or maintained by non-responsive responsible organizations.*

Changes to the default:

* Rapid7 will publish vulnerability details 45 days after providing CERT/CC vulnerability details, or on a timeline that is agreed upon with CERT/CC.

**Multi-Faceted Vulnerabilities***These vulnerabilities match more than one non-default category, such as a vulnerability for unsupported software that is exploited in the wild.*

* If there is a conflict in timelines, the shorter timeline shall apply.

# CVE-2023-4528: Java Deserialization Vulnerability in JSCAPE MFT (Fixed)

* Sep 07, 2023
* 4 min read
* [Ron Bowes](/blog/author/ron/)

*Last updated at Thu, 29 Aug 2024 14:58:36 GMT*

In August 2023, Rapid7 discovered a Java deserialization vulnerability in Redwood Software’s [JSCAPE MFT](https://www.jscape.com/) secure managed file transfer product. The vulnerability was later assigned CVE-2023-4528. It can be exploited by sending an XML-encoded Java object to the Manager Service port, which, by default, is TCP port 10880 (over SSL). Successful exploitation can run arbitrary Java code as the `root` on Linux or the `SYSTEM` user on Windows. CVE-2023-4528 is trivial to exploit if an attacker has network-level access to the management port and the Manager Service is enabled (which is the default). We strongly recommend taking the server down (or disabling the Manager Service) until it can be patched.

## Product description

CVE-2023-4528 affects all versions of JSCAPE MFT Server prior to version 2023.1.9 on all platforms (Windows, Linux, and MacOS). See the [JSCAPE advisory](https://www.jscape.com/blog/binary-management-service-patch-cve-2023-4528) for more information.

## Discoverer

This issue was discovered by Ron Bowes of Rapid7. It is being disclosed in accordance with Rapid7’s [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/).

## Vendor statement

CVE-2023-4528 has been addressed in JSCAPE version 2023.1.9 which is now available for customer deployment. JSCAPE customers have been notified and our support teams are available 24/7 to assist. Redwood appreciates the collaboration with Rapid7 and our cybersecurity partners. For more information, please see: <https://www.jscape.com/blog/binary-management-service-patch-cve-2023-4528>

## Impact

Successful exploitation executes arbitrary Java code as the Linux `root` or Windows `SYSTEM` user. The most likely attack vector will run Java code such as `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("...shell command...");`, but it's also possible to create a Java-only payload to avoid executing another process (and therefore wouldn’t be as easily detectable).

Once an attacker executes code at that level, they have full control of the system. They can steal data, pivot to attack other network devices, remove evidence of the intrusion, establish persistence, and anything else they choose. Notably, there appear to be very few (if any) instances of JSCAPE MFT Server with their management ports exposed to the internet, which significantly reduces attackers’ ability to reach the affected service.

## Indicators of compromise

Successful exploitation will be evident in log files. The Windows log file is `C:\program files\MFT Server\var\log\server0.log`, and Linux is `/opt/mft_server/var/log/server0.log`. Any warning or error messages that reference "Management connection" should be investigated — in particular, class casting exceptions such as:

```
08.22.2023 15:56:51 [WARNING] Management connection error: [10.0.0.77:10880 <-> 10.0.0.227:40085].

	... 10 more

```

The server expects a `Message` class, and the exploit sends a different class such as `java.lang.Runtime`, which fails and creates an error message.

Note that a more cleverly written exploit may not be this obvious in log files.

## Remediation

Rapid7 recommends that JSCAPE MFT Server customers immediately upgrade their instance(s) of MFT Server to version 2023.1.9 (upgrade documentation from Redwood Software [here](https://redwoodsoftware.mcoutput.com/mftserver/Content/MFTServer/upgrading_from_version_2_x_to_.htm)).

JSCAPE MFT customers should also close port 10880 to the public internet, ensuring that external/public access to the binary management service port (typically 10880) that is used by JSCAPE command line utilities is blocked. Settings for this port can be found in the administrative interface under Settings > Manager Service > Manager Service.

As a temporary mitigation before applying the patch, administrators can block access to the Management Service. On the configuration page (`http://[server]:11880/settings/settings`), either change the *Host/IP* option on the *Manager Service* page to `127.0.0.1`. Alternatively, under the *Access* tab, set up an IP filter (or block all IP addresses). Rapid7 validated that both options work.

For more information, see Redwood Software’s [advisory](https://www.jscape.com/blog/binary-management-service-patch-cve-2023-4528).

[![](https://www.jscape.com/hubfs/10_hidden%20costs%20of%20inadequate%20file%20transfer%20security.png)](https://www.jscape.com/blog/10-hidden-costs-of-inadequate-file-transfer-security)

Advanced secure file transfer solutions, like managed file transfer (MFT) servers, are no doubt more expensive than run-of-the-mill file transfer software. In fact, you can get a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server or even a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server for free. Many operating systems already have SFTP servers built-in, so they’re readily available at no additional cost.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) file transfers are two of the most user-friendly methods for carrying out user-initiated file uploads and downloads. Users only need a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Safari to perform these actions. In a previous tutorial, we outlined the [steps for setting up an HTTP file transfer](https://www.jscape.com/blog/how-to-set-up-an-http-file-transfer). So, in this post, we’ll focus more on HTTPS.

# **File transfer data breach risk: Real or overstated?**

Managed file transfer (MFT) vendors often highlight security as a key differentiator between MFT and traditional file transfer solutions. With their vast array of enterprise-grade security controls, MFT solutions are understandably more capable of protecting data and file transfer workflows. But are all these controls truly necessary?
