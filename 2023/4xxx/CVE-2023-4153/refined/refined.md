- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BAN Users plugin lacks a capability check on the `w3dev_save_ban_user_settings_callback` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization check leading to incorrect privilege assignment.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with minimal privileges (e.g., subscriber) can modify plugin settings, gain access to ban/unban functionality, and set the role of unbanned users, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber or higher level permissions.
