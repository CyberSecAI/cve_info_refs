- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the "Custom Content" and "Popup Description" fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, which can be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view or edit the affected popup, allowing for malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code into the "Custom Content" and "Popup Description" fields of a popup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a high-privilege user account, such as an administrator. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
