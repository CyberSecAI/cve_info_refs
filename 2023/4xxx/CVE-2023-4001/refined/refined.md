  "CVE-2023-4001": {
    "description": "An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB uses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file that contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the \"/boot/\" file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.",
    "root_cause": "The GRUB bootloader uses the UUID of a device to find the configuration file containing the password hash. When a removable drive with a duplicate UUID is attached, GRUB may select the incorrect device, leading to a bypass if the malicious drive does not contain the password configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass vulnerability due to improper handling of file system UUIDs.",
      "GRUB searches for configuration files by UUID without restricting the search to the device where the bootloader is located."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can bypass GRUB password protection, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the target system is required.",
       "Attaching an external drive (e.g., USB stick) with a duplicate UUID of the /boot filesystem."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs physical access to the target system and the ability to attach external bootable media. Attacker also needs the UUID of the /boot partition. This information can be obtained by an unprivileged user on the system via tools such as 'lsblk', or by viewing debug output during boot on some systems."
