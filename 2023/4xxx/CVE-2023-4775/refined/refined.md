Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-4775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'advanced_iframe' shortcode of the Advanced iFrame WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input within the 'advanced_iframe' shortcode attributes. This allows malicious code to be injected into the generated HTML.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly clean or validate the data supplied through the shortcode attributes, like `onload` and `custom`.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't encode the user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML output. This allows JavaScript code to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages where the vulnerable shortcode is used.
- **Account Takeover:** If an administrator views the page with injected JavaScript, an attacker might be able to steal their session and take control of the site.
- **Malicious Redirects/Content Manipulation:** The injected scripts could redirect users to malicious sites, display unwanted content, or modify the behavior of the website.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Injected scripts may be used to steal sensitive data like cookies

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious 'advanced_iframe' shortcode with JavaScript within the `onload` and `custom` attributes.
- **WordPress Post/Page Insertion:** The malicious shortcode is embedded into a WordPress post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages containing the malicious shortcode.
- **Ability to add shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to use the `advanced_iframe` shortcode.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Advanced iFrame plugin versions up to and including 2023.8.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2023.9 by restricting the usage of `onload` and `custom` attributes to users with the 'unfiltered_html' capability.
- The patch removes the `onload` and `custom` attributes if the user doesn't have the `unfiltered_html` permission.
- A potential duplicate of this issue is mentioned as CVE-2023-51690.
