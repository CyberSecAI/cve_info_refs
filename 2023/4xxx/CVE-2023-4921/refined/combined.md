[ 285.438662] Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint
Fix this by:
1. Changing sch\_plug's .peek handler to qdisc\_peek\_dequeued(), a
function compatible with non-work-conserving qdiscs
2. Checking the return value of qdisc\_dequeue\_peeked() in sch\_qfq.

    Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  When the "rx-all" feature was
    enabled on such a network interface, an attacker on the same
    network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive
    buffer, leading to a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly remote code execution.

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781
