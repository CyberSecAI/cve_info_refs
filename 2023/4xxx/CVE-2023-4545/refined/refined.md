The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the IBOS office OA system.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `checkids` parameter within the `recruit/bgchecks/export` route. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into the database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input passed to a database query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database. In this specific case, the attacker is able to extract the database name using error-based injection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP `GET` request to the vulnerable route (`r=recruit/bgchecks/export`), with the malicious SQL injection payload within the `checkids` parameter (e.g., `checkids=x`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBOS office OA system. They do not need prior authentication or authorization in order to exploit this vulnerability.
