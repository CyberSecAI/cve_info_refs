Cron log backup files contain administrator session IDs. It is trivial for any attacker who can reach the Pandora FMS Console to scrape the cron logs directory for cron log backups. The contents of these log files can then be abused to authenticate to the application as an administrator. This issue affects Pandora FMS <= 772.
