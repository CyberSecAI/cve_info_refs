The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/vm/doctor/doctors.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration or manipulation (accessing, modifying, deleting data)
    *   Authentication bypass
    *   Complete database takeover

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `/vm/doctor/doctors.php` file. The `id` parameter of the `GET` request is used to construct a SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable page.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `id` parameter in the request.

**Additional details:**
The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement using the `id` parameter:
`http://localhost/vm/doctor/doctors.php?action=view&id=0' union select 1,current_user(),database(),4,version(),6,7--+`
This query attempts to retrieve information about the current user, database, and version by leveraging the SQL injection flaw.
