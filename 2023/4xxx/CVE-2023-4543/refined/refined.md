Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `contactids` parameter of the `/recruit/contact/export` route in ibos Office OA v4.5.5. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization before constructing the SQL query. The `contactids` parameter is directly inserted into the query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user input before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided example demonstrates error-based SQL injection to leak the database name.
*   **Potential for Data Modification/Deletion:** Depending on the database permissions and the attacker's skills, it might be possible to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Full database takeover:** It may be possible to obtain full access to the database based on the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** By crafting a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted payload in the `contactids` parameter, an attacker can inject SQL code into the query. The example shows the usage of `r=recruit/contact/export&contactids=x` as a vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameters ( `r=recruit/contact/export&contactids=x`). Basic knowledge of SQL injection is necessary to craft the exploit payload.
