  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `flower_stats_timer` can schedule `flower_stats_work` and `flower_stats_work` can also arm the `flower_stats_timer`. During device detachment, the timer and workqueue can be rearmed leading to a use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free due to race condition between timer, workqueue, and device detachment."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can crash the system, causing a denial of service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user with the ability to detach cxgb4 device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user",
        "Ability to detach a cxgb4 device."
    ],
        "details": "The `flower_stats_timer` can schedule `flower_stats_work` and `flower_stats_work` can also arm the `flower_stats_timer`. When the cxgb4 device is detaching, the timer and workqueue could still be rearmed, potentially resulting in a use-after-free when a cleanup routine tries to access memory that has been freed during device detachment."
