  "CVE-2023-4889": {
    "Description": "The Shareaholic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'shareaholic' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 9.7.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'shareaholic' shortcode.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, leading to potential unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.",
     "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the 'shareaholic' shortcode through injecting malicious JavaScript code within the attributes of the shortcode.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions in WordPress."
