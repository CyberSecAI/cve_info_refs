The provided content discusses a zero-day SQL injection vulnerability found in a major provider of private election software.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the software's failure to properly sanitize user input in a URL parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code can be injected through a vulnerable URL parameter.
- **Database Misconfiguration:** The database is misconfigured, enabling attackers to escape the database confines and gain full control of the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software does not properly sanitize user-supplied parameters.
- **Outdated Technology:** The system relies on an old database (Sybase) which lacks modern security features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breaches:** Attackers can view how people voted in past elections, exposing sensitive voter data.
- **Vote Manipulation:** Attackers can submit fake votes, alter existing votes, and change election outcomes.
- **Server Takeover:** Attackers can take full control of the server, install backdoors, disable legitimate user accounts, and install malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Public URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by simply visiting a public URL and modifying parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Internet Access:** An attacker only requires internet access to reach the vulnerable URL.
- **Basic knowledge of SQL injection:** Ability to manipulate URL parameters and inject SQL code.

**Additional Notes**
- The vendor has taken steps to remediate the vulnerability, including hardening their web application firewall, but has not yet conducted a forensic audit or committed to publicly disclosing whether an attack occurred.
- The affected software is used by a significant number of organizations.
- The vendor is a small company that has been using outdated tech for decades, making remediation difficult.
- A CISA alert is expected.
