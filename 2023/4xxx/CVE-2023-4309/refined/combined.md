[00:09] all right we're going to get our next
[00:11] session started um it is my great
[00:13] pleasure to introduce schema who is uh
[00:16] going to be talking to us about flaws in
[00:19] a commercial uh voting system and how
[00:22] that can make its way into civil
[00:26] elections uh in the U.S so this is some
[00:28] really interesting work we were talking
[00:29] about online voting earlier uh now we
[00:32] have an example
[00:34] awesome thank you Matt
[00:39] how are we doing on volume you guys hear
[00:41] me perfect fantastic all right I'm
[00:43] schema I'm super excited to be here I've
[00:46] been attending Defcon for a long time
[00:48] but I'm excited to present excited to
[00:50] take you on this journey of this kind of
[00:53] little pocket of the world that many
[00:56] people don't know about including I
[00:57] didn't know about this I'm excited to
[00:59] bring you on that Journey
[01:01] so at the root elections are about power
[01:03] and influence and we elect the best to
[01:07] lead us and put their trust in them and
[01:09] with that trust comes a lot of controls
[01:12] since there's so much potential for
[01:13] abuse we have controls around the power
[01:15] that comes with elections but there's an
[01:17] area of Elections where those controls
[01:20] are much weaker and this is an area that
[01:22] doesn't get disgusted at places like
[01:25] this and I want to bring it out of the
[01:26] Shadows
[01:27] and that's private elections so private
[01:31] elections are elections for private
[01:33] organizations so think unions Amnesty
[01:36] International Harvard University tons
[01:39] and tons of organizations elect their
[01:41] leaders
[01:42] and the way those election works are
[01:44] very different than civil elections and
[01:46] as we're going to see there's some
[01:47] there's some problems there
[01:50] um so first I want to touch on why does
[01:52] this matter why do we why should we care
[01:53] about private elections
[01:55] let's let's imagine you're a foreign
[01:57] adversary and on one side you have the
[01:59] option of uh
[02:01] you know co-opting state and local
[02:04] election maybe getting a random
[02:06] Congressman in a state that matter is
[02:07] elected and that's kind of interesting
[02:09] interesting on the other side you have
[02:11] Harvard these big ngos you can you can
[02:14] get to elect the president of Harvard
[02:16] University and a lot of these National
[02:18] and international organizations that are
[02:20] very influential
[02:22] that second bucket had some very rich
[02:24] targets if you're a foreign adversary
[02:29] not only are the the organizations
[02:31] themselves interesting as a place of
[02:33] influence but private elections
[02:36] I'm sorry I hope you can hear me private
[02:38] elections are a stepping stone to major
[02:40] political offices
[02:42] so here we have Justin katanji Brown
[02:44] Jackson she started on the Harvard Board
[02:46] of overseer that's how she started to
[02:48] kind of gain influence and eventually
[02:49] came to be on the Supreme Court we have
[02:51] people that are involved with the
[02:52] American Medical Association Senators
[02:55] now uh ambassadors that got their start
[02:58] on these private elections they're the
[03:00] stepping stone for a lot of big major
[03:02] positions in U.S society
[03:08] so private elections have much less
[03:10] controls and scrutiny than traditional
[03:13] civil elections and as we're going to
[03:14] see in this talk
[03:16] their Technical Systems are highly
[03:18] vulnerable
[03:19] yeah and this talk I'm going to disclose
[03:22] a brand new zero day vulnerability and a
[03:25] major provider of election software
[03:27] private election software
[03:31] the CV number is here this is a live cve
[03:34] they're approximately 2 000 elections
[03:36] that are affected they're about civil
[03:38] elections the kinds you're familiar with
[03:39] and private elections but this vendor uh
[03:42] runs many of many private elections so
[03:46] we're going to focus on that part since
[03:47] it's so exploitable and such an
[03:49] interesting part that we don't talk a
[03:51] lot about
[03:55] all right well before we go diving
[03:58] deeper into private elections and what
[04:00] they are
[04:01] I want to First make the point of just
[04:04] how much work is involved in the
[04:06] traditional way of spying in the
[04:08] traditional way of gaining influence in
[04:10] the U.S
[04:11] here we have this operation this FBI
[04:13] operation FBI operation ghost story
[04:16] where they caught a group of 10 Russian
[04:19] spies that had spent decades building
[04:22] their cover in the U.S and because this
[04:25] is public information we can kind of dig
[04:26] deep into just how much work is put into
[04:29] doing this
[04:33] one of the spies is this gentleman here
[04:36] Andre he went by the name of Donald
[04:38] Howard heatfield that's a fake name
[04:41] that's the name of a Canadian deceased
[04:43] person so step one you want to be a spy
[04:45] you got to find some name and identity
[04:46] to take over step two he got a degree at
[04:50] Harvard to get that legitimacy so step
[04:52] two you actually have to be admitted to
[04:53] Harvard actually do the studying and
[04:56] we're only in step two then he married
[04:58] so he married in the U.S he had children
[05:01] legitimate children in the U.S his
[05:02] children didn't know he was a spy didn't
[05:04] know he was a Russian children believe
[05:06] the whole story
[05:07] uh he bought a house out here and then
[05:09] he worked his way up like everybody
[05:11] started at the bottom of a company and
[05:13] then kind of moved his way up and
[05:14] eventually got more and more influence
[05:16] he spent 20 years 20 plus years doing
[05:18] this this is what it takes to do things
[05:20] the traditional way
[05:22] there's a lot of energy because there's
[05:24] so much so much opportunity here to have
[05:26] tentacles everywhere in the U.S
[05:29] foreign adversary you spend a lot of
[05:31] time doing this
[05:38] so if you wanted to become a spy in the
[05:40] U.S there's that kind of path a the
[05:41] traditional path the laundry list of
[05:43] things the decades you need to put in to
[05:45] get in that position
[05:47] but if you wanted to take the shortcut
[05:49] just become an elected official become
[05:51] an elected official of a private
[05:53] organization go straight to the top
[05:56] yeah I'm sorry
[05:59] it is funny
[06:02] so if you were to take that path B
[06:04] here's the menu of organizations that
[06:07] you could put your people in and top
[06:08] leadership positions you have unions big
[06:11] major unions Auto Workers unions all
[06:13] sorts of Industries ngos we talked about
[06:17] those universities all the major
[06:18] universities elect their leadership
[06:20] Corporation professional bodies the
[06:23] associations that govern who gets to be
[06:24] a doctor who gets to be a lawyer you
[06:26] could put your people in that those
[06:28] positions Pension funds billions of
[06:30] dollars that get spent you could have
[06:33] your people deciding where that money
[06:34] goes this is attractive I I want this
[06:37] I'm interested and I'm sure a foreign
[06:40] adversary is too
[06:45] so now that we've established that these
[06:47] elections are influential and juicy
[06:49] targets for a foreign adversary I want
[06:51] to make a second point
[06:53] which is that these these elections are
[06:55] a lot easier to attack than traditional
[06:57] civil elections
[06:59] the big reason is polling traditional
[07:03] elections have a lot of polling towards
[07:05] party polling leading up to the
[07:06] elections by the time by the day the
[07:08] election comes we we already kind of
[07:11] know who's going to win
[07:12] and there's a lot of visibility and
[07:14] focus on that and if things don't line
[07:16] up with the polls people are going to
[07:17] notice there's a lot of scrutiny there's
[07:19] no polling in private elections these
[07:22] are a lot more open and these elections
[07:24] are all electronic no paper record I
[07:26] mean I think the crowd knows how
[07:28] dangerous all electronic connections are
[07:30] and here we have it we have just the the
[07:33] this explosive mix a very powerful
[07:35] positions no way to reconcile whether
[07:38] those those numbers make any sense with
[07:40] third party polling and all electronic
[07:43] elections to me that's pretty scary
[07:49] if you're like me you never heard about
[07:51] private elections before this I
[07:52] definitely hadn't and it's kind of the
[07:55] boring areas like this that foreign
[07:57] adversaries actually tend to attack
[07:58] rather than the very visible things
[08:06] so
[08:07] um
[08:09] so far we've been discussing a
[08:10] theoretical vulnerability in election
[08:12] software
[08:14] I want to get to the Practical now
[08:16] in this part of the talk we're gonna I'm
[08:18] gonna disclose a zero day uh
[08:20] vulnerability and one of the big major
[08:22] providers of election private election
[08:24] software I mentioned earlier there are
[08:27] about 2 000 elections affected it's a
[08:29] live CV and to tell you the story about
[08:32] this I want to tell you about my journey
[08:34] about how I discovered
[08:36] this
[08:37] I voted in one of these private
[08:40] elections
[08:42] and I realized that there's basically
[08:45] this one vendor that handles all these
[08:47] private elections you've never heard
[08:49] about but are very important and
[08:50] influential and this is what the process
[08:52] looks like you just go to some website
[08:54] this is an election for the State Bar of
[08:57] Texas it's a public URL you just you
[08:59] know go to this special webpage and then
[09:01] you put in your information here click
[09:03] submit and you vote and that's it that's
[09:05] the the whole part that's the whole
[09:06] story
[09:07] I voted in one of these elections my
[09:10] university has their alumni vote on the
[09:13] leadership of the organization so I went
[09:15] to a page very similar to this put in my
[09:17] information and and I made a typo in the
[09:19] information I put in
[09:22] and I got to this error page now the
[09:24] error page doesn't isn't so interesting
[09:26] but the part that is interesting is the
[09:28] URL
[09:29] and I want to tell you about that so if
[09:31] we focus on that for a second
[09:34] this is what that URL looks like
[09:37] and there's two parameters but there's
[09:39] this one parameter here that just has a
[09:40] bunch of numbers doesn't seem so so
[09:42] interesting but I may be being a little
[09:45] too curious a person I'm sure this
[09:47] audience can relate
[09:49] um if you start playing around with
[09:51] these parameters and start putting code
[09:53] in that parameter rather than the normal
[09:55] numbers the system expects if you start
[09:57] putting code in that in this case if we
[10:00] put an instruction to wait for 30
[10:02] seconds
[10:03] the software actually executes that
[10:05] instruction
[10:07] it's crazy I mean if we just put
[10:10] something a random you know thing in the
[10:12] URL and we got the software to actually
[10:13] run that code
[10:16] um
[10:16] this now getting the software to wait 30
[10:19] seconds is pretty innocuous but I as a
[10:22] security researcher know how serious a
[10:24] thing that is this is called an SQL
[10:26] injection
[10:28] and what it means is that
[10:30] you know in a traditional way a system
[10:31] works there's the database that has all
[10:34] the important information about the
[10:36] system about who voted and how they
[10:38] voted and so on and then there's
[10:40] software that's a gatekeeper of that
[10:42] so that if a regular user tries to ask
[10:44] information they're not entitled to like
[10:46] how the ex-person vote the gatekeeper
[10:49] makes sure that they're not given that
[10:51] information
[10:52] and an SQL injection is
[10:54] really problematic because it allows us
[10:57] to bypass this gatekeeper to ask the
[10:59] database directly how did Alice vote oh
[11:02] how about we change this particular vote
[11:04] or how about we add new votes to this
[11:06] database and nobody would know because
[11:08] there's no paper backups it's all
[11:09] electronic these elections
[11:15] uh
[11:20] so the recap with this SQL injection
[11:22] vulnerability
[11:23] just to visit sorry I'll get out of the
[11:25] way
[11:26] uh just to visit just by visiting this
[11:29] one public URL and kind of messing with
[11:31] the parameters a little bit
[11:33] we're able to do anything to the
[11:35] database to view how people voted to
[11:38] submit fake votes
[11:40] and then to overwrite existing votes to
[11:42] change how existing people voted this is
[11:44] a very serious thing all through that
[11:46] kind of URL parameter and putting
[11:47] special things in there
[11:50] there's even a little bonus there's a
[11:52] number four on this the database is
[11:55] misconfigured in a way that allows an
[11:58] attacker to escape the confines of the
[12:01] database and take full control of the
[12:03] server
[12:05] um so an attacker in this situation can
[12:08] you know even kick out the legitimate
[12:10] owners of the server and disable their
[12:13] user accounts can install software they
[12:15] can install a back door a back door
[12:18] means that even if the actual
[12:19] vulnerability your url messing around
[12:22] stuff we've seen earlier even if the
[12:24] vendor fixes that if somebody has
[12:26] managed to install a back door an
[12:28] attacker can continue to get in until
[12:30] the back door itself is fixed so they
[12:32] really have total control of this
[12:34] machine
[12:39] so we were talking about the impact
[12:41] earlier there's about 2 200 elections
[12:44] affecting started from 2001 so anybody
[12:47] can see how those elections or an
[12:48] attacker could see how voters have voted
[12:50] in those elections lots of organizations
[12:53] you'd recognize Teamsters IBEW Amnesty
[12:56] International lots of universities Yale
[12:58] University example California State Bar
[13:00] Publications public pension systems and
[13:03] most of the states out there and many
[13:06] many more organizations like this
[13:15] thank you
[13:16] so in this section of the the
[13:18] presentation I want to talk a lot about
[13:20] a bit about the um the process of
[13:23] discovering and Reporting this
[13:24] vulnerability
[13:25] it's a very concerning thing it's a very
[13:27] shocking thing to discover and
[13:30] um when you discover something like this
[13:32] it's difficult to approach the vendor
[13:34] directly like who am I to reach out to
[13:36] the vendor and say hey everything is
[13:37] broken here will they even believe me uh
[13:40] will they will they trust me will I be
[13:42] even able to reach out to the right
[13:43] person to get a hold of them and get
[13:45] them to pay attention
[13:47] in this case I had the assistance of
[13:49] sisa sisa is a department of uh is a an
[13:53] agency part of the Department of
[13:54] Homeland Security and they do exactly
[13:56] this and I want to bring them up to if
[13:58] anybody in this audience is thinking
[14:00] about exploring election vulnerabilities
[14:02] private or otherwise there are a
[14:04] fantastic player they do exactly this
[14:06] they help researchers like I I am
[14:08] disclose vulnerabilities to the vendor
[14:11] and they're the government and the
[14:13] vendor pays attention attention when the
[14:15] Department of Homeland Security is
[14:16] knocking saying hey there's something
[14:17] wrong with your software and in this
[14:19] case they very much did thanks to cesa's
[14:21] help if you're ever considering doing a
[14:24] vulnerability vulnerability disclosure I
[14:27] want I couldn't couldn't say enough good
[14:29] things about them very technically Savvy
[14:32] team very competent they're amazing to
[14:34] work with this is the URL you put your
[14:36] report there and they'll be in touch to
[14:38] help remediate it
[14:41] and since we're talking about
[14:43] remediation I want to give you an update
[14:46] on how things stand with this particular
[14:48] private election vendor that is
[14:49] responsible for a lot of private
[14:51] elections they have taken steps to
[14:54] remain remediate the vulnerability we
[14:55] just talked about including by hardening
[14:57] their web application firewall
[14:59] but one thing they haven't yet done and
[15:01] I want to highlight is we don't know if
[15:04] people have exploited this vulnerable
[15:06] vulnerability it's certainly uh
[15:10] there's certainly the potential there
[15:11] but we don't know if it's happened and
[15:13] the only people that really have a
[15:14] chance to know is the vendor
[15:16] so the vendor has yet to commit to do a
[15:19] forensic audit of their logs to see if
[15:21] there's ever been an attack if they have
[15:23] evidence of an attack they haven't
[15:24] committed yet to publicly disclose if
[15:26] they do or don't find something and
[15:28] that's still something that's up in the
[15:29] air
[15:34] and that's it I wanted to introduce you
[15:36] to the world of private election
[15:37] software I'll take some questions from
[15:38] here but to me this was a fascinating
[15:40] and intriguing little part of the world
[15:42] thank you
[15:47] thank you
[15:52] awesome
[15:55] oh yeah you can hear I don't think I can
[15:57] hear I'll repeat your question yeah
[16:01] Bills going through
[16:05] each do you know what I'm talking about
[16:06] yes I do yeah maybe you can talk a
[16:08] little
[16:11] bit sure
[16:12] yeah absolutely the question is around
[16:15] uh pending legislation that will uh
[16:18] require organizations to disclose
[16:19] vulnerability vulnerabilities like this
[16:24] yeah when they've been breaching what
[16:25] was grabbed I don't know the exact
[16:27] details but it's my understanding that
[16:29] uh the legislation that's most likely to
[16:31] pass only affects public companies which
[16:34] this organization is not there's a lot
[16:37] of these random one-off vendors this is
[16:39] a very small organization uh they're
[16:41] probably like a 10 15 person company and
[16:44] I don't know if you're familiar with
[16:45] that XKCD comic where there's like a
[16:47] whole pile of things that are that are
[16:49] built up and then there's that one
[16:51] little node at the bottom that
[16:52] everything depends on it's very much
[16:54] like this so I don't know if that
[16:56] legislation would affect them but I
[16:57] wouldn't be surprised if they're exempt
[16:58] from it because there's just such a tiny
[17:00] player but so many of us depend on them
[17:02] doing their job right and paying
[17:04] attention and kind of having scrutiny on
[17:06] that so I don't know if it affects them
[17:07] directly
[17:08] I mean because it's it's important
[17:10] legislation people don't know that
[17:12] organizations get breached they're not
[17:14] required to tell you they've engaged all
[17:16] of a sudden your stuff is on the
[17:17] darkness that's right yeah today the
[17:20] comment here was that many organizations
[17:22] are not required to disclose a breach
[17:24] when it happens and you know suddenly
[17:26] you just find your information on Dart
[17:27] Webb and you might not even know which
[17:29] organization is responsible for it right
[17:31] that is very much the status quo we do
[17:33] need to get that fixed for sure
[17:36] yeah
[17:37] fantastic
[17:39] yeah absolutely thank you so much for
[17:42] the work that you've done like thank you
[17:43] you're why I'm here you're a hero this
[17:45] is amazing right thank you uh I looked
[17:47] up the cve I've noticed that it's not
[17:49] disclosed yet thank you for doing
[17:50] responsible disclosure uh my question is
[17:53] has the vendor been
[17:55] uh giant jerks about this or have they
[17:58] been like oh wow thank you we can fix
[18:00] this given a timeline Etc yeah the
[18:03] question was how has a
[18:05] uh how is the vendor responded to this
[18:07] and the response I think has been uh
[18:10] quite effective and big part because
[18:12] csun's evolved so I want to emphasize
[18:13] again like if you're if you're thinking
[18:15] of doing this involve an organization
[18:17] like sisa they're fantastic
[18:19] um they've been taking steps at
[18:20] remediating their the the
[18:22] vulnerabilities we talked about here but
[18:24] a lot of their systems are just very old
[18:26] they run on this very old version very
[18:29] old database called SCI base and it's
[18:32] missing a lot of the security features
[18:34] we expected modern databases but they're
[18:36] just stuck with it you know they built
[18:37] this thing decades ago and it's working
[18:38] at least you know working but still has
[18:42] security problems right so they're in
[18:44] this tough spot where they're trying to
[18:45] fight their demons in their Tech debt
[18:46] that they have and and make the best out
[18:48] of that so my impression is that they're
[18:51] earnestly trying but also the the the
[18:53] tech stack is in a difficult position
[18:55] for them to quickly remediate everything
[18:58] completely yeah does that answer your
[19:01] question
[19:02] yeah
[19:03] so yeah go ahead I was gonna say yeah so
[19:06] since we can't read up on the cve yet or
[19:09] what company you're not you're not uh
[19:12] wanting to tell us what company that is
[19:13] that's right I'd rather not disclose the
[19:16] company since I I want to give them a
[19:18] chance to do as many steps as they can
[19:20] fully resolving the vulnerability
[19:21] they've done a lot there's still some
[19:23] stuff on their plate I don't want to
[19:24] give them a chance the election
[19:26] Community might want to know absolutely
[19:28] I I will publish a paper with the full
[19:30] details including naming the vendor uh
[19:32] you can yeah go ahead sorry I don't know
[19:34] if anyone else is around them uh so have
[19:38] you recommended to them and or they
[19:39] recommended their customers mitigating
[19:41] controls so I mean simply put it behind
[19:43] a web right like that would help quite a
[19:46] bit Yeah attempts for SQL induction yeah
[19:48] so the I think there's two questions
[19:50] there's two questions here has
[19:52] um
[19:53] has a vendor made a has a vendor alerted
[19:55] their customers here and have they put
[19:57] it behind a wife is that capturing the
[19:59] questions yeah so let me start the
[20:01] second one they have put it behind a
[20:02] laugh that's been pretty effective but
[20:03] there's still stuff to do on the first
[20:05] question they're planning a public
[20:07] announcement I haven't seen it live yet
[20:08] they know that this talk is happening
[20:10] uh
[20:11] uh I don't think the the customers have
[20:14] have been made aware yet but they are
[20:16] planning to make them aware
[20:18] and there's also a sisa alert that's
[20:20] going out Monday covering this so
[20:27] in today's Times
[20:30] I don't know it seems to me I I
[20:31] personally do you find it embarrassing
[20:34] that companies are still having basic
[20:37] SQL injection vulnerabilities the
[20:40] question is do you do I find it
[20:42] embarrassing that companies still have
[20:44] SQL injection vulnerabilities yes
[20:46] absolutely it is correct this is nuts
[20:48] this is crazy you go to a website and
[20:50] you type stuff in the URL and you have
[20:51] access to the database this is this is
[20:53] insanity and we've known about these
[20:55] failures for a very very long time but
[20:58] it kind of goes back to this concept I
[21:00] was saying earlier you know there's just
[21:02] these random vendors you've never heard
[21:04] about and some Nook of the world that so
[21:07] many critical things depend on and
[21:09] they're you know they've been operating
[21:10] this business for decades and it works
[21:12] and they're not necessarily growing
[21:14] their business they've sort of captured
[21:15] all the business there is to grow they
[21:16] don't really have incentive to tear it
[21:18] down and make it better it's just it's
[21:20] working there's a lot of this there's a
[21:22] lot of things like this especially in
[21:23] critical infrastructure so it is an
[21:26] embarrassment but I also don't don't see
[21:28] it going away very much
[21:29] yeah
[21:31] yeah
[21:33] hey thank you for the talk it was really
[21:35] cool
[21:36] um so now that you've found this
[21:37] vulnerability in one of the as you said
[21:39] many vendors uh have you considering
[21:42] doing it systematically for all the
[21:43] other online vendors just to see if this
[21:46] maybe is more widespread than just this
[21:47] one I have I definitely have
[21:50] um there is one vendor that has a formal
[21:52] bug Bounty program and uh their system
[21:56] is uh
[21:59] it gets a lot more attention from
[22:00] security researchers because there's a
[22:02] bit of money there so there's definitely
[22:04] opportunity to research this I haven't
[22:07] gone as deep as as I wanted to because
[22:09] this has been so all-consuming and
[22:10] especially helping the vendor get to the
[22:12] finish line and Remediation has been
[22:13] most of what I've been focused on
[22:24] I think we're good then yeah thank you
[22:26] very much
[22:27] [Applause]
