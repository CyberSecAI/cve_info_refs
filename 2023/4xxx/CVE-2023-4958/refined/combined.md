## New features

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

### Bring your own PostgreSQL database for RHACS Central (Technology Preview)

When installing RHACS, instead of creating an exclusive RHACS PostgreSQL database instance, you can use your existing one.

|  | Bring your own PostgreSQL database is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.   For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/). |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Installing Central with an external database using the Operator method](../installing/installing_ocp/install-central-ocp.html#install-central-operator-tech-preview_install-central-ocp).

### The CORE BPF collection method is now generally available

The runtime collection method based on BPF CO-RE (Compile Once-Run Everywhere) introduced in RHACS 4.1 is now generally available on `x86_64` and `s390x` architectures. To enable it, set the value of your backed-up cluster’s `collector.collectionMethod` parameter to `CORE_BPF`.

* [Configuring the secured-cluster-services Helm chart with customizations](../cloud_service/installing_cloud_other/install-secured-cluster-cloud-other.html#configure-secured-cluster-services-helm-chart-customizations-cloud-other)

### RHACS product usage report

RHACS now provides a product usage report to help estimate RHACS consumption for licensing. It lists the number of secured OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes nodes and the number of CPU units used for secured clusters. To download this report in CSV format, go to the **System Health** dashboard and click **Show product usage**. You can also get the product usage data using the API.

For more information, see [Viewing product usage data](../operating/use-system-health-dashboard.html#viewing-product-usage_use-system-health-dashboard).

### Performance improvements for the Compliance dashboard

RHACS 4.2 includes significant performance improvements for the Compliance dashboard.

Based on testing with a 50-cluster and 4900-node-environment, these improvement includes:

* **2x** speed improvement in cold start.
* From **7x** to **500x** speed boost in **Request after caching**, with a minor improvement in requests involving large data transfers (`600` KiB).
* Memory utilization on Central has decreased from `10` GiB to just `500` MiB.
* CPU utilization has dropped from `4.5` vCPUs to `0.8` vCPUs.

### Vulnerability scanning support for Registry Mirrors in OpenShift Container Platform

If you have a disconnected environment or use registry mirrors to satisfy your organizational controls on external content, RHACS can now scan images from your registry mirrors in OpenShift Container Platform environments.

This feature leverages the **delegated image scanning** functionality introduced in RHACS 4.1. The delegated image scanning functionality allows RHACS Secured cluster services to use Sensor to pull images for scanning from registry mirrors you have set up by using the `ImageContentSourcePolicy`, `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, or `ImageTagMirrorSet` custom resources.

For more details, see [Accessing delegated image scanning](../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.html#accessing-delegated-image-scanning_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities).

### Configure delegated image scanning in the RHACS portal

RHACS 4.1 introduced **Scanning support for images pulled from on-premise registries** to support RHACS Cloud Service environments, allowing you to delegate vulnerability scanning to the RHACS secured cluster services using APIs. With RHACS 4.2, the delegated image scanning feature is now available in RHACS, and you can configure it using the RHACS portal.

For more information, see [Accessing delegated image scanning](../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.html#accessing-delegated-image-scanning_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities).

### Define new system policies using CVE age or fixability

To support your organization’s vulnerability management policies, you can now use the following new vulnerability management policy criteria:

* **CVE Is Fixable**: This criterion results in a violation only if the image in the deployment you are evaluating has a fixable CVE.
* **Days Since CVE Was First Discovered In Image**: This criterion results in a violation only if it has been more than a specified number of days since RHACS discovered the CVE in a specific image.
* **Days Since CVE Was First Discovered In System**: This criterion results in a violation only if it has been more than a specified number of days since RHACS discovered the CVE across all deployed images in all clusters that RHACS monitors.

### On-demand and downloadable CVE report in Vulnerability Management 2.0 (Technology Preview)

RHACS 4.2 introduces workload vulnerability reporting in Vulnerability Management 2.0 (Technology Preview). You can now create on-demand reports and download them in CSV format. Like VM 1.0, you can continue generating scheduled or on-demand reports and sending them by an email notifier. The report includes rich detail for detected CVEs, including Deployment info, Image info, and detailed CVE data such as Fixable Status, Component Upgrade Version, Severity, CVSS score, and more.

|  | Vulnerability Management 2.0 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.   For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/). |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Vulnerability reporting in Vulnerability Management 2.0](../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-management.html#vulnerability-reporting-vuln-mgt2).

### Scanner supports additional operating systems

RHACS 4.2 can now identify vulnerabilities in images with the following Linux distributions:

* `alpine:v3.18`
* `debian:12`
* `ubuntu:23.04`
* `ubuntu:23.10`

For more information, see [Scanning Images](../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.html#scanning-images_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities).

### Improvements to runtime network policy generation

With this release, you can now generate policies from within the **Network Graph** and narrow down policies that apply to specific deployments and namespaces in a cluster. You can also use the **Filter deployments** section criteria to narrow the generated policies' scope further. After generating network policies, you can compare the generated policies with the existing network policies and view them side-by-side to understand the differences in the YAML files for the policies. You can download the generated policies or share them with system notifiers, such as Slack, that you have previously set up using integrations in RHACS.

### Build time Network Policy tools (Technology Preview)

|  | Build time Network Policy tools is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.   For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/). |
| --- | --- |

Based on user feedback, Red Hat has restructured the command-line syntax and expanded the toolset.
The following three `netpol` tools operate on a given file directory, which includes all of the project’s workload manifests, including network policy manifests if available.

These command line tools help teams to shift network security left. With the automated generation of Kubernetes network policies and the supplementary validation tools, Dev and DevOps teams can include network policy development into their Build pipeline, using the RHACS command-line interface, `roxctl`.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `roxctl netpol generate` | Generates Kubernetes network policies by analyzing your project’s YAML manifests in a specified directory. In older versions, the command was `roxctl generate netpol`. For more information, see [Using the build-time network policy generator](../cli/generating-build-time-network-policies.html#using-the-build-time-network-policy-generator_generating-build-time-network-policies). |
| `roxctl netpol connectivity map` | Lists the allowed connections between workloads based on the workload and Kubernetes network policy manifest in the specified directory. Results also include a graphical representation in `.dot` format. For more details, see [Connectivity mapping using the roxctl connectivity-map command](../operating/manage-network-policies.html#connectivity-mapping-using-the-roxctl-connectivity-map-command_manage-network-policies). |
| `roxctl netpol connectivity diff` | Lists the differences in allowed connections between two project versions based on the workload and Kubernetes network policy manifest in each version directory. This feature shows the semantic differences which are not noticeable when performing a source code syntactic `diff`. For more details, see [Identifying the differences in allowed connections between project versions](../operating/manage-network-policies.html#identifying-the-differences-in-allowed-connections-between-project-versions_manage-network-policies). |

Currently, you can use these tools without authenticating with RHACS. Red Hat plans to include more advanced features when you authenticate with RHACS in a future release.

### New Listening Endpoints menu in the RHACS portal

RHACS provides information about processes listening on ports for all deployments in a secured cluster. Until now, this information was only accessible through the API. In RHACS 4.2, you can see detailed information about which processes are listening on what ports using the RHACS portal. It includes details about the process, port, pod, and container, and you can sort and filter the list using **Deployment**, **Namespace**, or **Cluster** criteria.

For more information, see [Auditing listening endpoints](../operating/audit-listening-endpoints.html).

### Viewing network policy YAML files from a violation

In the RHACS portal, the **Deployment** tab shows a new **Network policies** section when viewing violations for a specific policy. If the namespace to which the deployment belongs has network policies listed, you can click on a listed policy to view or download the entire YAML file for that network policy.

## Notable technical changes

* RHACS now includes `ALL` as a valid value for drop capabilities. The policy implementation has been changed so that if the policy criteria specifies that a deployment must drop a capability, for example, `A or B`, and a deployment manifest contains `DROP ALL`, it does not violate the policy.
* In RHACS 4.2, the `SecuredCluster` custom resource definition (CRD) includes a new parameter called `spec.admissionControl.replicas` to configure the number of replicas for the admission controller. The default value for this parameter is `3`.
* You do not need to set `ForceRollbackVersion` for rolling back from future RHACS 4.x releases to version 4.2 or later.
* Authentication is now mandatory for certain endpoints that were previously public. Specifically, `/v1/metadata`, `/v1/database/status`, and `/v1/mitreattackvectors` now require authentication. This change decreases the potential exposure to denial of service (DoS) attacks and blocks attackers from exploiting the information accessible through these endpoints.
* Non-autogenerated image integrations no longer use the `/v2/_catalog` registry repository list during matching. Additionally, to turn off repository list matching for autogenerated integrations, set the new environment variable `ROX_DISABLE_REGISTRY_REPO_LIST` to `true` on Central.
* The **Component Upgrade** column in vulnerability reports is renamed to **CVE Fixed In**.
* Previously, access to the `/api/docs/swagger` API required read permission for the **Integration** resource. Now, it only requires users to be authenticated to access it.
* Scanner now selects the image for scanning based on its architecture alignment with the Scanner’s architecture, rather than consistently choosing `amd64` for multi-arch image scanning.

  + For example, if Scanner runs on `s390x` and an `s390x` version of the multi-arch image exists, it scans that `s390x` image.
  + If no image matches Scanner’s architecture, then it attempts to scan the `amd64` version, as it did previously.
* Telemetry data collection is enabled by default, except for installations with the offline mode enabled. To disable telemetry, see [Opting out of Telemetry](../telemetry/opting-out-of-telemetry.html#opting-out-of-telemetry).
* Integration with OpenShift Container Platform monitoring is configured and enabled by default for RHACS installations on OpenShift 4. To deactivate this integration, set the flag `monitoring.openshift.enabled` to `false`.
* Go executable in the following images available at `registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security` are dynamically linked and compiled with the `CGO_ENABLED=1` option:

  + `rhacs-main-rhel8`
  + `rhacs-rhel8-operator`
  + `rhacs-scanner-rhel8`
  + `rhacs-scanner-slim-rhel8`
  + `rhacs-roxctl-rhel8`

    However, the `roxctl` binary which you download from the RHACS portal is still statically linked.

### Deprecated features

The following section provides additional information about deprecated features listed in the preceding table.

* Red Hat has deprecated the following commands for build-time network policy generation (Technology Preview) feature:

  + `roxctl generate netpol`, use the `roxctl netpol generate` command instead.
  + `roxctl connectivity-map`, use the `roxctl netpol connectivity map` command instead.
* Red Hat is scheduled to remove the CIS Docker v1.2.0 standard from RHACS Compliance checks starting in RHACS 4.4.
* Starting with version 4.0, RHACS does not evaluate the risk associated with service account permissions for deployments.

### Removed features

The following section provides additional information about the removed features listed in the preceding table.

#### Dark mode

Dark mode in RHACS Cloud Service had rendering issues with buttons and images, leading to an inconsistent experience. Therefore, the dark mode and its toggle button are now removed from the navigation. (ROX-16515)

#### PDF export

Red Hat removed the PDF export feature from the Vulnerability Management dashboard. Instead, you can use the updated vulnerability reporting feature in Vulnerability Management 2.0 (Technology Preview). (ROX-16394)

|  | Vulnerability Management 2.0 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.   For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/). |
| --- | --- |

#### Report configuration without an associated collection

In version 4.0, RHACS released the collections feature that replaced access scopes used in report configurations.
RHACS automatically created equivalent collections for access scopes used in existing report configurations and migrated report configurations to use newly-created collections.
If the migration failed, the report configurations became non-functional, and RHACS logged the error messages in Central logs and in the RHACS web portal.

RHACS 4.2 deletes the report configurations that could not be migrated.
To avoid losing any existing report configurations, create valid collections for reports that failed the migration and attach the collection to the report configuration before you upgrade to RHACS 4.2.

For more information on collections, see [Creating and using deployment collections](../operating/create-use-collections.html#create-use-collections).

#### Offline-mode flag

Red Hat has removed the `--offline-mode` flag for the `roxctl scanner generate` command.

#### Use Container IAM role option in ECR integration for RHACS Cloud Service

Red Hat has removed the **Use Container IAM role** option from RHACS Cloud Service from the ECR integration configuration page.

## Notice for upcoming changes

* Previously, the Syslog notifier sent an incorrect message header; RHACS flipped the severity and name fields. When configuring the notifier, you can now select the following options:

  + `CEF`: The corrected message header. Default option when you are configuring using the RHACS portal.
  + `CEF (legacy field order)`: This is the previous incorrect message header. Default option if you use API and do not specify a value for the message header. Red Hat plans to remove the wrong message header option `CEF (legacy field order)` in version 4.4. Additionally, all legacy field order notifiers will be migrated to `CEF`.
* In a future version, Red Hat plans to enable authentication for the following API endpoints:

  + `/v1/featureflags`
  + `/v1/resources`
* If you are using these API endpoints, you must prepare to use them with authentication.
* Starting from RHACS 4.3, Red Hat will not support rolling back to RHACS 3.x or RHACS 4.0.
* Red Hat has delayed the removal of the `/v1/report` API endpoint in RHACS 4.2; it will now be removed in RHACS 4.3.
* Red Hat will remove the following widgets from the Compliance dashboard in RHACS 4.4:

  + CIS Docker v1.2.0 Compliance
  + PCI DSS 3.2.1 Compliance
  + CIS Kubernetes v1.5 Compliance
  + NIST SP 800-53 Compliance
  + NIST SP 800-190 Compliance
  + HIPAA 164 Compliance

## Bug fixes

### Resolved in version 4.2.0

**Release date**: 18 September 2023

* Previously, if a non-blocking socket failed to open a connection, Collector would still report that as a connection. This issue has been fixed. (ROX-17486)
* In RHACS 4.2, Collector correctly handles asynchronous connection establishment.(ROX-17486)
* Previously, Operator installations broke if the OpenShift cluster-wide proxy was enabled and Central or SecuredCluster CR configured an egress proxy environment variable. This issue is fixed. (ROX-18477)
* Previously, when using eBPF on IBM Z, RHACS reported incorrect process UNIX group IDs (GID). This issue is now fixed. (ROX-17459)
* In previous RHACS versions, there was a mismatch in the number of CVEs reported by JSON output and table output. This issue is now fixed. (ROX-15277)
* Previously, integrating RHACS with Jira failed when you used an OAuth token or JWT while configuring the integration. This issue is fixed. (ROX-17992)

### Resolved in version 4.2.1

**Release date**: 3 October 2023

* A sensor panic could occur in version 4.2.0 if a cluster contained deployments with an invalid image reference, for example, `image: " "`, and delegated scanning was enabled for all registries. This issue has been fixed.
* The minimum permissions required to display 6 of the sidebar links in the RHACS web portal were too strict in the 4.2.0 release, and are reduced in this release.

### Resolved in version 4.2.2

**Release date:** 23 October 2023

This release of RHACS fixes the following security vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2023-44487](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487) and [CVE-2023-39325](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325): Flaw in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol
* Various CVEs in containers, including [CVE-2023-4527](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4527), [CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4806), [CVE-2023-4813](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4813), and [CVE-2023-4911](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4911): glibc security issues

It contains the following bug fixes and changes:

* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform customers using the downloaded manifest bundle with automatic upgrades enabled found that Sensor did not automatically upgrade, and failed with a `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKS_FAILED` error. This issue has been fixed. (ROX-19955)
* A new default policy has been added, "Rapid Reset: Denial of Service Vulnerability in HTTP/2 Protocol". This policy alerts on deployments with images containing components that are susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability for HTTP/2 servers, as described in [CVE-2023-44487](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487) and [CVE-2023-39325](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325). This policy applies to the build or deploy life cycle stage.

### Resolved in version 4.2.3

**Release date:** 27 November 2023

This release of RHACS includes updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) base images and includes the following fixes:

* [CVE-2023-44487](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487): Flaw in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol.
* The HTTP/2 functionality in the RHACS Operator webhook has been disabled to mitigate CVE-2023-44487.
* In some cases, CVEs that were deferred and approved were not added to the list of snoozed CVEs. An issue with the `/v1/suppress` and `/v1/unsuppress` APIs caused this behavior, and has been fixed.

### Resolved in version 4.2.4

**Release date:** 22 January 2024

* Fixed PostgreSQL vulnerabilities in `scanner-db` containers.

### Resolved in version 4.2.5

**Release date**: 14 March 2024

This release provides the following bug fix:

* Fixed an issue where an upgrade to version 4.2 from an earlier version caused the Central component to enter a crash loop.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
