- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not prevent directory listing for the directories where it stores attachments to job applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure due to lack of access control on directories containing uploaded files. The vulnerability relies on the web server's autoindex feature being enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated visitors can list and download private attachments associated with job applications. This leads to exposure of potentially sensitive information, such as resumes, cover letters, or other personal documents.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can access the vulnerable directories by navigating to the URL `/wp-content/uploads/awsm-job-openings/YYYY/MM/` where YYYY represents the year and MM the month the files were uploaded, if the autoindex feature of the web server is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special access, they simply need to know the vulnerable URL path if the webserver has the autoindexing feature enabled.
