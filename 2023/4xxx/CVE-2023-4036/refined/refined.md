The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4036.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Simple Blog Card plugin does not properly check the access permissions of posts when displaying them via a shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the post ID from the shortcode parameter without proper authorization checks.
- **Broken Access Control:**  Authenticated users (even with subscriber-level privileges) can access content intended for higher-level users or content that should be private.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber) can access the titles and content of arbitrary posts, including:
- Draft posts
- Private posts
- Password-protected posts

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a specific shortcode with the `simpleblogcard` shortcode, including a `url` parameter with a target post ID.
- The attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=parse-media-shortcode` and the crafted shortcode in the body.
- The server responds with the HTML content of the target post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a registered user with subscriber level privileges.
- The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress blog's frontend.
