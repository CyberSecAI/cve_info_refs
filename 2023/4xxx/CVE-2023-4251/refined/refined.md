- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EventPrime plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks when creating bookings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to create unwanted bookings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form and tricks a logged-in user into submitting it. This form contains the necessary parameters to create a booking and is sent to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page and submitting a form.
