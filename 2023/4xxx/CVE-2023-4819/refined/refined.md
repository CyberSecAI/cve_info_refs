- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not set the correct `Content-Type` header for uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin allows uploading files with allowed extensions, but fails to ensure proper handling of the file's content type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload a file (e.g., a JPG image) injected with malicious JavaScript code. When the victim accesses the uploaded file's URL, the injected script will execute within their browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's file upload mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can upload a file to the server and then induce a victim to open a link to the malicious file.
