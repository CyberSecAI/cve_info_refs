## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shared Files < 1.7.6 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not return the right Content-Type header for the specified uploaded file. Therefore, an attacker can upload an allowed file extension injected with malicious scripts.

### Proof of Concept

Upload an allowed WordPress extension such as JPG and inject it with a script such as: <script>alert(1);</script>. To access the resource, the uploaded file ID can be seen in the source code of the (Preview) button under data-file-url as such: /shared-files/{FILE\_ID}/?xss.jpg and can be triggered using HTTP://url.com/shared-files/{FILE\_ID}/?xss.jpg

### Affects Plugins
