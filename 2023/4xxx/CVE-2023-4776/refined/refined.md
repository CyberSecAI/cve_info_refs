- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin uses the WordPress `esc_sql()` function on a field not delimited by quotes and did not first prepare the query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi). Improper use of `esc_sql()` function without preparing the query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a POST request to `wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-student` by a user with teacher privileges. The attacker injects SQL code in the ClassID parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a teacher.
