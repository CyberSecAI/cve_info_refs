## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Weaver Xtreme Theme Support < 6.3.1 - Admin+ PHP Object Injection

### Description

The plugin unserialises the content of an imported file, which could lead to PHP object injections issues when a high privilege user import a malicious file and a suitable gadget chain is present on the blog.

### Proof of Concept

To simulate a gadget chain, put the following code in a plugin:
class Test {
public function \_\_wakeup() : void {
die("Arbitrary deserialization");
}
}
Create a file named "poc.txt" with the following content: O:4:"Test":0:{};
Upload the file via the "Choose File" feature in Weaver Xtreme Theme Support > Filters
Then choose Restore Filter Options.
The view the response of the request made, which will have the "Arbitrary deserialization" message.
