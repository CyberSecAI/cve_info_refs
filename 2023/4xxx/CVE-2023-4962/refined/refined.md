Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping within the `Video PopUp` WordPress plugin's shortcode functionality. Specifically, the plugin does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied attributes used in the `video_popup` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because the plugin allows unfiltered user input through shortcode attributes that are then rendered in the HTML output of the page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided data used as attributes within the shortcode before rendering them in the HTML output. Specifically, the attributes `text`, `title`, `img` and `co` were vulnerable before patching.
*   **Missing Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of the shortcode attributes before inserting them into the HTML, leading to potential for malicious script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into pages on the WordPress website.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** When a user visits a page containing the injected malicious script, the script will execute in their browser.
*   **Account Takeover/Data Theft/Redirects:** An attacker could potentially use this to perform actions such as stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector is through the `video_popup` shortcode. By inserting malicious JavaScript code within shortcode attributes, attackers can have the code embedded in the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level permissions. This is sufficient because users with these permissions can create posts/pages and insert shortcodes.
*   **WordPress Backend Access:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin panel to be able to create or modify pages or posts and insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.3 of the Video PopUp plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.4 of the plugin by implementing proper sanitization and escaping for shortcode attributes.
*   The vulnerable attributes were: `text`, `title`, `img` and `co`.
*   The fix included:
    *   Using `esc_html()` to sanitize the `text` and `title` attributes
    *   Using `esc_url()` to sanitize the `img` attribute
    *   Using regex to sanitize the `co` attribute
