The Absolute Privacy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'abpr_profileShortcode' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user email and password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
