- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not escape the `PHP_SELF` server variable when outputting it in attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed by the victim's browser. This could lead to the compromise of the user's account or other malicious actions. The vulnerability can be exploited against high-privilege users such as admin.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricks a logged-in admin into visiting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in admin into clicking it. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
