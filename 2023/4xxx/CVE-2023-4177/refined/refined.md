{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient verification of previously registered MFA during the process of delivering MFA codes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system does not properly verify the email address associated with MFA, allowing an attacker to change it to an address under their control.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can circumvent MFA safeguards and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized activities, or exposure of confidential information.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with valid login credentials (username and password) can exploit the vulnerability by changing the associated email address for MFA.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs valid login details (username and password) for an EmpowerID user account."
