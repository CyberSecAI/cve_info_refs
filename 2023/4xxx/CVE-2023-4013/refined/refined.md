- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks when managing its license.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to update or deactivate the plugin's license without their consent. This could lead to disruption of service or potentially unauthorized access depending on the plugin's functionality linked to licensing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page containing crafted HTML forms that trigger the license update or deactivation actions on the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious page and social engineer a logged-in administrator to visit it. The attacker does not need any prior knowledge of a valid license to deactivate the plugin's license. To update the plugin's license they would need a valid license.
