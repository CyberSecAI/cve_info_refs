Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4282

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `admin_post_remove` and `remove_private_data` functions within the EmbedPress plugin. These functions are responsible for deleting plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check before executing the plugin settings deletion functions. This means that the plugin doesn't verify if the user performing the action has the necessary permissions to do so.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Although not explicitly stated, the missing authorization check allows any authenticated user with subscriber privileges or above to potentially trigger actions they shouldn't, which can be viewed as an IDOR variation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation results in the deletion of the plugin's settings.
- **Loss of Functionality:** Deleting the plugin's settings can lead to the plugin malfunctioning or having to be reconfigured.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** An attacker must have an authenticated account (subscriber level or higher) on the affected WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs an account on the target WordPress site with subscriber privileges or higher.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.8.3 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code can be located in the `Embedpress_Google_Helper.php` file at lines 801 and 807.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an authenticated user to delete the pluginâ€™s settings without needing the appropriate level of authorization, potentially disrupting the website's functionality.
