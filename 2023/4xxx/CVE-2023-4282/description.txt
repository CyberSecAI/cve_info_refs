The EmbedPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'admin_post_remove' and 'remove_private_data' functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to delete plugin settings.
