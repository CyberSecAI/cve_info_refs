- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and escaping in the "File Manager Pro" plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. In this case, it's triggered by an admin/super-admin when they access a specific part of the plugin and press an access key combination.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious POST request containing JavaScript code injected into the `themesValue` parameter within the `selector_themes` action, an attacker with admin/super-admin access can store the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with admin or super-admin privileges to the vulnerable WordPress instance. They must also access a specific part of the plugin and press the access key combination.
