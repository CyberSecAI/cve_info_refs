Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `GetInvoiceDetail` function of the WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin. This means the function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to access invoice details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of a capability check or authorization verification before retrieving and displaying invoice details. This allows any user with access to the WordPress site, including subscribers (as mentioned), to potentially access sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Attackers can view arbitrary invoices by guessing order IDs and invoice IDs. This exposes potentially sensitive information such as customer details, purchase history, addresses, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Specific Function:** The attack targets the `GetInvoiceDetail` function through the WordPress AJAX API (`wp_ajax_rednao_wcpdfinv_get_invoice_details`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress account, with at least subscriber level permissions.
*   **Guessing Ability:** The attacker needs to be able to guess order and invoice IDs, which could be feasible depending on the site's configuration.
