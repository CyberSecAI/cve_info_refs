- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPB Show Core plugin is vulnerable to a local file inclusion due to the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `path` parameter in the `download-file.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI). The plugin allows an attacker to include and access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (`wp-config.php`), system files (`/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/hosts`) or other files containing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a GET request to `wpb-show-core/download-file.php` with the `path` parameter set to the path of the desired file. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication or special permissions. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
