- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Booking Calendar plugin fails to sanitize and escape booking form data, specifically within the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the booking form, which will then be executed when an administrator accesses the calendar overview dashboard. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting the admin to malicious pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by submitting a booking form containing malicious JavaScript code in the "First Name" or "Last Name" fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be an unauthenticated user and needs to submit a crafted booking form. The XSS payload gets triggered when an administrator accesses the calendar overview dashboard.
