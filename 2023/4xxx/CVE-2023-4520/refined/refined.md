Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4520

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `FV Flowplayer Video Player` plugin. Specifically, the `save` function, hooked via `init`, does not properly handle user-supplied data related to the `_fv_player_user_video` meta key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `_fv_player_user_video` meta value. This injected script will then execute in the browser of any user who views the page where the video is displayed.
2.  **Arbitrary Usermeta Update:** The `save` function permits arbitrary updates to user metadata. Although the vulnerability description notes that the meta value can only be a string, this could still be leveraged to modify user settings or profiles in an unintended way.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Stealing sensitive user data
*   **Arbitrary Usermeta Update:** While limited to string values, this allows an attacker to potentially modify user profiles or settings which could lead to:
    *   Privilege escalation
    *   Denial of service by corrupting user configurations

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the `save` function when processing user-submitted data that influences the `_fv_player_user_video` meta key.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the plugin's `save` function.
*   No specific user privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerable code is present in the `models/custom-videos.php` file of the plugin, specifically before the fix introduced in changeset [2957322](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2957322/fv-wordpress-flowplayer#file2).
*   The fix for this vulnerability includes sanitizing the input using `sanitize_text_field()` before saving it into the database, as seen in the diff for `models/custom-videos.php`.
*   The fix also includes usage of `wp_verify_nonce()` to verify the nonce.
*   The affected versions are up to and including 7.5.37.7212, and the patched version is 7.5.39.7212.
*   The vulnerability was publicly published on August 24, 2023 and last updated on January 22, 2024
