## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# PowerPress Podcasting < 11.0.12 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape the media url field in posts, which could allow users with privileges as low as contributor to inject arbitrary web scripts that could target a site admin or superadmin.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following payload to the Media URL field:
<img src=x onerror=alert(origin)> <svg onload=alert(origin)>
