### Description

The Order Tracking Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the order status parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers (admin or higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
