Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-4796:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2023-4796**, describing an information disclosure vulnerability in the "Booster for WooCommerce" WordPress plugin. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions this CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the `wcj_wp_option` shortcode in the "Booster for WooCommerce" plugin. This shortcode allows retrieval of arbitrary WordPress options from the database.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive site options. The `wcj_wp_option` shortcode retrieves option values from the WordPress database without adequate sanitization and access control.
   - **Missing Input Sanitization**: The older version of the code, before the patch, didn't sanitize input attribute values for shortcodes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker could retrieve sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, internal settings, or any other data stored as a WordPress option. This could lead to further compromise of the website, such as unauthorized access to data or functionality, or full takeover of the site.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The vulnerability is exploited through the `wcj_wp_option` shortcode. By crafting a malicious post/page/widget containing the shortcode, a malicious user could gain unauthorized access to the system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "subscriber" level capabilities or above. This means they need an account on the WordPress site and the ability to create/edit content where the vulnerable shortcode can be included.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects "Booster for WooCommerce" versions up to and including 7.1.0.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability was patched in version 7.1.1.
*   **Sanitization Introduced:** The patch introduces `wcj_sanitize_input_attribute_values` which sanitizes user input, preventing the injection of malicious data and protecting against XSS and information disclosure.
*   **XSS vulnerability:** In addition to the authenticated information disclosure, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to shortcodes has also been fixed in this patch.

In summary, CVE-2023-4796 is an authenticated information disclosure vulnerability in the "Booster for WooCommerce" plugin that allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information by exploiting the `wcj_wp_option` shortcode. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.1.1, and users are advised to update to the latest patched version.
