The Booster for WooCommerce for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Disclosure via the 'wcj_wp_option' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 7.1.0 due to insufficient controls on the information retrievable via the shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level capabilities or above, to retrieve arbitrary sensitive site options.
