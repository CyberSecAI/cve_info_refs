  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-4508",
    "description": "A user able to control file input to Gerbv, between versions 2.4.0 and 2.10.0, can cause a crash and cause denial-of-service with a specially crafted Gerber RS-274X file.",
    "affected_versions": "2.4.0 to 2.10.0",
    "patched_versions": "Unknown",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to the usage of an uninitialized `fd->filename` pointer when processing include file commands (`IF`). When an included file contains an invalid M-code, the program attempts to print an error message including the filename, leading to a crash as the filename is uninitialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted Gerber RS-274X files with `IF` commands pointing to files containing invalid M-codes.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the file input to Gerbv.",
      "additional_details": "The issue is triggered when parsing an included file with an invalid M-code (e.g., M09*). The program attempts to log this error by accessing `fd->filename`, which is not initialized when an included file is parsed. This causes a crash due to an invalid memory access."
