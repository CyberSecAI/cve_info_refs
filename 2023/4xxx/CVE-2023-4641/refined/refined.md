  "CVE-2023-4641": {
    "Description": "The shadow-utils packages include programs for converting UNIX password files to the shadow password format, as well as utilities for managing user and group accounts. A flaw was found in shadow-utils. When asking for a new password, shadow-utils asks the password twice. If the password fails on the second attempt, shadow-utils fails in cleaning the buffer used to store the first entry. This may allow an attacker with enough access to retrieve the password from the memory.",
    "Root cause": "When asking for a new password, the `agetpass()` function in shadow-utils copies the password into a static buffer named `pass`. If the second password entry attempt fails, this buffer is not cleared, potentially leading to a password leak.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper cleanup of sensitive data in memory"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker with sufficient access could potentially retrieve the previously entered password from memory if the second password entry attempt fails.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would need to trigger a password change via `passwd(1)` or `gpasswd(1)` and cause the second password attempt to fail.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system, ability to execute `passwd(1)` or `gpasswd(1)` and force the password confirmation to fail."
