Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `leyka_ajax_get_env_and_options` function within the Leyka WordPress plugin. This function directly outputs sensitive environment and options data without proper access control or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes sensitive information such as API keys, passwords (e.g., Sberbank API key and password, PayPal Client Secret), and other potentially confidential data.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The function can be accessed by any authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher, which is not the intended level of access for such sensitive information.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The output of the `leyka_get_env_and_options` is not sanitized before being displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the following:
*   **Unauthorized Access to Payment Gateways:** Attackers can gain access to payment gateway API credentials, potentially allowing them to manipulate transactions or steal funds.
*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to a data breach, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the website and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
*   **Web Request:** An attacker can send an AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_leyka_get_env_and_options` action endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress website. This implies that they need a valid user account on the affected site.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting an AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Leyka plugin versions up to and including 3.30.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.30.7.1.
*   The vulnerable function is located in `/inc/leyka-ajax.php`.
