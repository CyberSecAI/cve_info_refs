- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin retrieves client IP addresses from potentially untrusted headers, allowing attackers to manipulate the IP value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** IP Spoofing. The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize the IP address obtained from the `Client-Ip` header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can manipulate the IP address logged by the plugin, which could be used to hide the source of malicious traffic or bypass security measures that rely on IP address verification.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a `Client-Ip` header set to a spoofed IP address, an attacker can make the plugin record the fake IP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or access is required.
