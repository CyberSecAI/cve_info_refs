- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `columns[1][data]` parameter is used directly within an `ORDER BY` clause without proper escaping or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability. The vulnerability allows for boolean-based blind SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `columns[1][data]` parameter used in the `ORDER BY` clause within the `catagory_data.php` file.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve all data from the database through boolean-based blind SQL injection. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed via the `catagory_data.php` file through the HTTP POST request method. The attacker can manipulate the `columns[1][data]` parameter in the POST request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application, and there is no need for prior authentication or specific roles.
