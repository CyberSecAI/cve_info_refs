## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MasterStudy LMS < 3.0.18 - Unauthenticated Instructor Account Creation

### Description

The plugin does not have proper checks in place during registration allowing anyone to register on the site as an instructor. They can then add courses and/or posts.

### Proof of Concept

1. Visit the Profiles Settings page for the plugin: MS LMS > LMS Settings > Profiles
2. Ensure that "Disable Instructor Registration" and "Disable Instructor Pre-moderation" are both "On". Save settings.
3. On a course page, click "Enroll Course"
4. Register a new user. Intercept the request, ex:
```
{"user\_login":"user123","user\_email":"user@example.com","user\_password":"Password123","user\_password\_re":"Password123","become\_instructor":"true","privacy\_policy":true,"degree":"","expertize":"","auditory":"","additional":[],"additional\_instructors":[],"profile\_default\_fields\_for\_register":[],"redirect\_page":"http://site.com/user-account/"}
```
4. Change the `become\_instructor` value to `true`
5. The account will have instructor privileges, allowing them to add new courses and publish blog posts for review.
