Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4562

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper authentication in the MELSEC-F Series main modules. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for 8-digit keyword authentication and improper authentication for 16-digit keyword authentication

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** This is the core weakness, where the system fails to properly verify the identity of the user or process requesting access.
   -  Lack of authentication for 8-digit keyword authentication
   -  Improper authentication for 16-digit keyword authentication

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially obtain sequence programs from the affected product.
- **Information Tampering:** An attacker can write malicious sequence programs or improper data into the product.
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanisms.
- All of the above can occur remotely without proper authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending illegitimate messages over a network.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers must have network connectivity to the vulnerable devices.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability allows for exploitation without requiring prior authentication.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low.

**Affected Products:**
- Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-F series programmable controllers with Ethernet communication special adapter FX3U-ENET-ADP or Ethernet communication block FX3U-ENET(-L) with certain exceptions
   - A detailed list of affected models is provided.

**Mitigations:**
- Use firewalls or VPNs to prevent unauthorized access when internet access is required.
- Use the products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.
- Restrict physical access to the affected products and the LAN connected by them.

**CVSS Score:**
- 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
