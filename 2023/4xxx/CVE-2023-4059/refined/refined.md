- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Profile Builder plugin's page creation function lacks authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF protection in the page creation function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can create the register, log-in, and edit-profile pages on the blog.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the `admin-post.php` endpoint with specific parameters (`page=profile-builder-basic-info&wppb_create_pages=true&wppb_force_create_pages=true`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, and can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending the crafted request.
