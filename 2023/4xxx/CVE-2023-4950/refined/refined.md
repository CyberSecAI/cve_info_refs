- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the name field of a contact form, which will then be executed when an administrator views the "Leads" section, potentially leading to account compromise or further malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated user can submit a crafted form with malicious script in the input field of a contact form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication to submit the malicious script via the contact form. An administrator has to access the "Leads" section for the script to be executed.
