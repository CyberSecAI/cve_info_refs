- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin retrieves client IP addresses from potentially untrusted headers, which allows manipulation of the IP address by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** IP address spoofing due to reliance on client-provided headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can hide the source of malicious traffic by manipulating the reported IP address. This could allow them to bypass IP-based security measures or hide their actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with a spoofed "Client-Ip" header to the WordPress login page (/wp-login.php).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress login page, and they do not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to add or modify HTTP headers.
