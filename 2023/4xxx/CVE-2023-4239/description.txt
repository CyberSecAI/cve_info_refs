The Real Estate Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 6.7.1 due to insufficient restriction on the 'rem_save_profile_front' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wp_capabilities' parameter during a profile update.
