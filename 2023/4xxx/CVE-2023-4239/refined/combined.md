### Description

The Real Estate Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 7.2 due to insufficient restriction on the 'rem\_save\_profile\_front' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wp\_capabilities' parameter during a profile update.
