Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4999

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the `[horizontal-scrolling]` shortcode of the "Horizontal scrolling announcement" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `group` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sufficient preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses the user-supplied `group` parameter in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might gain complete control over the affected WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `[horizontal-scrolling]` shortcode.
- **User Input:** The `group` parameter within the shortcode is the injection point for malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least subscriber-level permissions to use the shortcode functionality.
- **Ability to use Shortcodes:** The attacker must be able to insert and use shortcodes within WordPress content, this is normally available to subscriber level and above users

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in the `HSA_shortcode` function. The `$group` variable, derived from the `group` attribute of the shortcode, is directly concatenated into the SQL query. Specifically, lines 74-81 within the `horizontal-scrolling-announcement.php` file show how the `$group` variable is used in the SQL query without being sanitized.
```php
$sSql = "select hsa_text,hsa_link,hsa_target,hsa_options from ".WP_HSA_TABLE." where hsa_status='YES'";
$sSql = $sSql . " and ( hsa_dateend >= NOW() or hsa_dateend = '0000-00-00 00:00:00')";
$sSql = $sSql . " and ( hsa_datestart <= NOW() or hsa_datestart = '0000-00-00 00:00:00')";
if($group <> "")
{
    $sSql = $sSql . " and hsa_group='$group'";
}
$sSql = $sSql . " ORDER BY hsa_order";
```
This direct inclusion allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands by crafting a malicious `group` value.

**Additional Notes:**
The Wordfence article mentions that there is no patch available for the vulnerability, and recommends either mitigating the risk or uninstalling the plugin.
The plugin's source code, available on WordPress.org, confirms the vulnerability in the specified versions.
