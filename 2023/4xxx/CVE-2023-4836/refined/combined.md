## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress File Sharing Plugin < 2.0.5 - Subscriber+ Sensitive Data and Files Exposure via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not check authorization before displaying files and folders, allowing users to gain access to those filed by manipulating IDs which can easily be brute forced

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a private folder that contains a file that you intend keep secret.
2. Add the plugin shortcode `[upf\_manager]` to a post.
3. Access a file that you have access to and intercept the request.
4. Manipulate the `doc\_id` to contain the number of of a file that you want to access (this will be random), for example: `doc\_5712`
5. See that the response discloses the file when the user doesn't have access to it: `{"doc\_ttl":"secret-image.jpg","doc\_src":"https:\/\/example.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upf-docs\/usr1\_1694106985\_secret-image.jpg","doc\_desc":"","file\_type":"img","cmnts\_html":"","author":"admin@example.com"}`
6. The file can then be directly downloaded.
Note: The `fldr\_id` can also be manipulated.

# CVE-2023-4836 – User Private Files – IDOR to Sensitive data and private files exposure / leak of info – POC

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-4836 – User Private Files – IDOR to Sensitive data and private files exposure / leak of info – POC

When testing the plugin, the vulnerability **“Insecure direct object references (IDOR)”** was discovered, which allows you to view someone else’s folder through a specialized request to the server and download files of someone else without his consent, even if he did not share the file. **All users** and their files that they have ever downloaded are at risk. This vulnerability can be carried out from the user with the lowest privileges – **“Subscriber”**, if there is a page with the plugin’s shortcode on your site, or on behalf of the user **“Contributor”** to create a page with this plugin.

## **Main info:**

| September 26, 2023 | The author has released a fix update |
| October 9, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-4836** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

While conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the **User Private Files plugin**, a significant security vulnerability was identified – **“Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).”** This vulnerability allows malicious actors to access someone else’s folders, download files without consent, and potentially expose sensitive data. Even users who have never shared their files are at risk. Remarkably, this security flaw can be exploited by users with minimal privileges, such as “**Subscribers**,” provided that a page with the plugin’s shortcode exists on the website or by “**Contributors**” when creating a page with the plugin.

## **Understanding of IDOR attack’s**

**“Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)”** is a security issue where an attacker can manipulate input and gain unauthorized access to data or resources. In the context of this vulnerability, attackers can craft specialized requests to the server **to access folders and download files belonging** to other users, even without explicit sharing permissions.

## **Exploiting the IDOR**

Exploiting the **IDOR vulnerability** in the **User Private Files plugin** involves manipulating requests to access and download files from other users’ folders. Attackers, even with minimal privileges, can craft requests to bypass access controls and obtain sensitive files. This can be accomplished through targeted **URL manipulation** or by creating pages with the plugin and subsequently accessing files linked to those pages.

The risks associated with **CVE-2023-4836 are substantial**. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can:

* Access sensitive files and data belonging to other users.
* Download files without the owner’s consent, even if they were never shared.
* Potentially expose confidential information.
* Compromise the privacy and security of user data.

In a **real-world scenario**, imagine an attacker leveraging this vulnerability to access and download files from unsuspecting users on a website utilizing the **User Private Files plugin**. By manipulating URLs or creating pages with the plugin, the attacker can access files that were never meant to be shared or **accessed by unauthorized users**. This could lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and reputational damage to the website.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To mitigate the risks posed by **CVE-2023-4836** and enhance the overall security of websites using the User Private Files plugin, consider the following recommendations:

* **Update the plugin:** Ensure the User Private Files plugin is updated to the latest version, which should include a patch to address this vulnerability.
* **Access controls:** Implement robust access controls and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to user files and data.
* **Security testing:** Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and rectify IDOR vulnerabilities proactively.
* **User awareness:** Educate website users about privacy and the importance of not sharing sensitive files through public pages or links.
* **Least privilege principle:** Limit the capabilities and permissions of user roles to reduce the potential impact of a compromised account.

> By adhering to these recommendations, website administrators can significantly reduce the risk of **IDOR vulnerabilities** and enhance the overall security posture of their WordPress installations.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress File Sharing Plugin < 2.0.5 - Subscriber+ Sensitive Data and Files Exposure via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not check authorization before displaying files and folders, allowing users to gain access to those filed by manipulating IDs which can easily be brute forced

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a private folder that contains a file that you intend keep secret.
2. Add the plugin shortcode `[upf\_manager]` to a post.
3. Access a file that you have access to and intercept the request.
4. Manipulate the `doc\_id` to contain the number of of a file that you want to access (this will be random), for example: `doc\_5712`
5. See that the response discloses the file when the user doesn't have access to it: `{"doc\_ttl":"secret-image.jpg","doc\_src":"https:\/\/example.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upf-docs\/usr1\_1694106985\_secret-image.jpg","doc\_desc":"","file\_type":"img","cmnts\_html":"","author":"admin@example.com"}`
6. The file can then be directly downloaded.
Note: The `fldr\_id` can also be manipulated.

[![CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/New_1_not_safe-1.png "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")](https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-12280/ "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")

WP Customer Area is a versatile and modular WordPress plugin designed to provide a private content management solution. With features like sharing files and pages with specific users or groups, it has become a preferred choice for managing confidential content in WordPress websites. However, in version 8.2.4 and earlier, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered, which allows unauthorized users to delete event logs without proper authentication.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as logs often contain critical records of user actions and system events. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could erase these logs, effectively covering their tracks and compromising a site’s ability to identify malicious activities. Notably, the plugin is now discontinued, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to alternative solutions.
