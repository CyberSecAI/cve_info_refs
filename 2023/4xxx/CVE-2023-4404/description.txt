The Donation Forms by Charitable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.7.0.12 due to insufficient restriction on the 'update_core_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to specify their user role by supplying the 'role' parameter during a registration.
