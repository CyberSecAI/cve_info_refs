- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin `Simple Blog Card` does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the attributes `url`, `color`, `color_width`, `t_line_height`, and `d_line_height` are not sanitized before being output.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected pages/posts. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes. The shortcode is then embedded in a WordPress post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role within WordPress. They must have the ability to create or edit posts/pages where they can insert the vulnerable shortcode.
