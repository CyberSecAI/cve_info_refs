The AffiliateWP for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'affwp_activate_addons_page_plugin' function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.14.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to activate arbitrary plugins.
