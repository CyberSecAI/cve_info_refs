## Description

Copying the same vulnerability from CUPS to cover the fix in libppd, reported by [@todb](https://github.com/todb)

# CVE-2023-4504: OpenPrinting CUPS/libppd Postscript Parsing Heap Overflow

[AHA!](https://takeonme.org/) has discovered an issue with CUPS and libppd from OpenPrinting, and is publishing this disclosure in accordance with AHA!’s standard [disclosure policy](https://takeonme.org/cve.html) today, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) has been assigned to this issue.

Any questions about this disclosure should be directed to cve@takeonme.org.

## Executive Summary

Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted CUPS document, CUPS version v2.5b1 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) appears to be an instance of [CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html), a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Technical Details

The scan\_ps function in the CUPS codebase provides functionality that scans through a string looking for the next Postscript object. When iterating through a string which contains an open parenthesis and ends with a single backslash (0x5c) character, the code incorrectly iterates forward a character without properly checking the bounds of the string resulting in a 1 byte read beyond the allocated heap buffer.

## Snippet of the vulnerable code:

cups/cups/raster-interpret.c

```
1039 static _cups_ps_obj_t   *               /* O  - New object or NULL on EOF */
1040 scan_ps(_cups_ps_stack_t *st,           /* I  - Stack */
1041         char             **ptr)         /* IO - String pointer */
1042 {
...
1085   switch (*cur)
1086   {
1087     case '(' :                          /* (string) */
1088         obj.type = CUPS_PS_STRING;
1089         start    = cur;
1090
1091         for (cur ++, parens = 1, valptr = obj.value.string,
1092                  valend = obj.value.string + sizeof(obj.value.string) - 1;
1093              *cur;
1094              cur ++)
1095         {
1096           if (*cur == ')' && parens == 1)
1097             break;
1098
1099           if (*cur == '(')
1100             parens ++;
1101           else if (*cur == ')')
1102             parens --;
1103
1104           if (valptr >= valend)
1105           {
1106             *ptr = start;
1107
1108             return (NULL);
1109           }
1110
1111           if (*cur == '\\')
1112           {
1113            /*
1114             * Decode escaped character...
1115             */
1116
1117             cur ++;
1118
1119             if (*cur == 'b')
1120               *valptr++ = '\b';
1121             else if (*cur == 'f')
1122               *valptr++ = '\f';
1123             else if (*cur == 'n')
1124               *valptr++ = '\n';
1125             else if (*cur == 'r')
1126               *valptr++ = '\r';
1127             else if (*cur == 't')
1128               *valptr++ = '\t';
1129             else if (*cur >= '0' && *cur <= '7')
1130             {
1131               int ch = *cur - '0';
1132
1133               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1134               {
1135                 cur ++;
1136                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1137               }
1138
1139               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1140               {
1141                 cur ++;
1142                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1143               }
1144
1145               *valptr++ = (char)ch;
1146             }
1147             else if (*cur == '\r')
1148             {
1149               if (cur[1] == '\n')
1150                 cur ++;
1151             }
1152             else if (*cur != '\n')
1153               *valptr++ = *cur;
1154           }
1155           else
1156             *valptr++ = *cur;
1157         }

```

Line 1085 contains the case statement which provides the logic used to iterate through the given string.

On line 1091, the for loop within the case statement is used to iterate through each character after encountering an open paranthesis character (0x28), storing the pointer to the current character in cur.

On line 1111, the code checks if the current character is a backslash and finally, in line 1117, the character index is incremented without checking the length, now pointing to the null byte terminating the string.

Upon the next iteration of the loop, on line 1094, the loop now begins iterating through unallocated memory resulting in undefined behaviour.

A Base64 encoded blob of an example PostScript document that can trigger the issue is below.

```

```
## Attacker Value

By providing this malformed PostScript document, an attacker could compromise the machine running the affected software, either CUPS or another application that uses the libppd library. Once compromised, this can provide an attacker a unique, privileged position in the targeted network.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### **[sahayap](/sahayap)** commented [Jul 23, 2023](#issue-1817333395)

| Dear Team.  I am Sahaya Darcius from Bixolon Co., Ltd, and I hope you all doing well. As a part of our ongoing efforts to develop AirPrint support for our printers, we have been using the PAPPL framework, CUPS 2.4.5, and OpenSSL-1.1.1g. While our printing functionality has been successfully implemented, we have encountered an issue with the Web UI interface.  Upon conducting a thorough analysis, we have identified the root cause of the problem, which lies in the "cupsHashData" function within the "papplClientGetCSRFToken" function in the "client-accessors.c" file. It has come to light that this function returns incorrect Hash binary data.  Upon further investigation, we discovered that the "cupsHashData" function in the "cups/hash.c" file only supports GnuTLS and does not extend its compatibility to OpenSSL. The discrepancy in the algorithm values passed from the "papplClientGetCSRFToken" function is another contributing factor, as it uses "sha2-256," whereas OpenSSL expects "sha256."  In light of these findings, we have taken the initiative to resolve the issue by implementing our own hash data function for sha256 using OpenSSL. I am delighted to inform you that this solution has proven to be successful, and the Web UI is now functioning optimally.  However, we believe that adding OpenSSL support to the "cupsHashData" function in the "cups/hash.c" file would greatly enhance its usability and flexibility for other users facing similar challenges. Therefore, I kindly request your esteemed team to consider integrating OpenSSL support into the "cupsHashData" function.  Your support in implementing this enhancement will undoubtedly benefit many users in the community who rely on CUPS and OpenSSL for their printing solutions.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Best Regards, Sahaya Darcius P |

| Hi [@sahayap](https://github.com/sahayap) ,  if your new hash function is part of open source code and applicable after changes into CUPS code, it would be great if you opened a pull request.  I've created a PR implementing the function in OpenSSL - it was interesting to try OpenSSL for once. |

| [@michaelrsweet](https://github.com/michaelrsweet) I've taken the commit from master for this and applied in 2.4.x directly (review of the merge sounded as waste of your time since it is a plain copy of your commit from master - without translation typo fix - do let me know if you would like to do reviews of such commits too next time). I didn't see any API breakage and build+test passed on my machine.  Fixed in [master](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/commit/4db1ca0ea978f) and [2.4.x](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/commit/b5b1418da7) |

| This commit breaks builds of cups without gnutls/openssl as it drops the #ifdef HAVE\_GNUTLS logic and makes gnutls required if openssl is not available, which is unfortunate given the security fixes in 2.4.7.  Could the #ifndef HAVE\_GNUTLS logic be reinstantiated please? |

| Ouch, I'm sorry for that - the removal should happen in 2.5, so the fix has to be a little bit different in 2.4.x - I've created PR here [#794](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/pull/794) .  But be aware TLS library like OpenSSL/LibreSSL or GnuTLS are required since 2.5. |

Package        : cups
Version        : 2.2.10-6+deb10u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-4504 CVE-2023-32360
Debian Bug     : #1051953

Two issues have been found in cups, the Common UNIX Printing System(tm).

CVE-2023-4504

  Due to missing boundary checks a heap-based buffer overflow and code
  execution might be possible by using crafted postscript documents.

CVE-2023-32360

  Unauthorized users might be allowed to fetch recently printed documents.

  Since this is a configuration fix, it might be that it does not reach
  you if you are updating the package.
  Please double check your /etc/cups/cupds.conf file, whether it limits
  the access to CUPS-Get-Document with something like the following
  >  <Limit CUPS-Get-Document>
  >    AuthType Default
  >    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM
  >    Order deny,allow
  >   </Limit>
  (The important line is the 'AuthType Default' in this section)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.10-6+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

For the detailed security status of cups please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cups>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Description

Copying the same vulnerability from CUPS to cover the fix in libppd, reported by [@todb](https://github.com/todb)

# CVE-2023-4504: OpenPrinting CUPS/libppd Postscript Parsing Heap Overflow

[AHA!](https://takeonme.org/) has discovered an issue with CUPS and libppd from OpenPrinting, and is publishing this disclosure in accordance with AHA!’s standard [disclosure policy](https://takeonme.org/cve.html) today, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) has been assigned to this issue.

Any questions about this disclosure should be directed to cve@takeonme.org.

## Executive Summary

Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted CUPS document, CUPS version v2.5b1 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) appears to be an instance of [CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html), a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Technical Details

The scan\_ps function in the CUPS codebase provides functionality that scans through a string looking for the next Postscript object. When iterating through a string which contains an open parenthesis and ends with a single backslash (0x5c) character, the code incorrectly iterates forward a character without properly checking the bounds of the string resulting in a 1 byte read beyond the allocated heap buffer.

## Snippet of the vulnerable code:

cups/cups/raster-interpret.c

```
1039 static _cups_ps_obj_t   *               /* O  - New object or NULL on EOF */
1040 scan_ps(_cups_ps_stack_t *st,           /* I  - Stack */
1041         char             **ptr)         /* IO - String pointer */
1042 {
...
1085   switch (*cur)
1086   {
1087     case '(' :                          /* (string) */
1088         obj.type = CUPS_PS_STRING;
1089         start    = cur;
1090
1091         for (cur ++, parens = 1, valptr = obj.value.string,
1092                  valend = obj.value.string + sizeof(obj.value.string) - 1;
1093              *cur;
1094              cur ++)
1095         {
1096           if (*cur == ')' && parens == 1)
1097             break;
1098

1121             else if (*cur == 'f')
1122               *valptr++ = '\f';
1123             else if (*cur == 'n')

1129             else if (*cur >= '0' && *cur <= '7')
1130             {
1131               int ch = *cur - '0';
1132
1133               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1134               {
1135                 cur ++;
1136                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1137               }
1138
1139               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1140               {
1141                 cur ++;
1142                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1143               }
1144
1145               *valptr++ = (char)ch;
1146             }
1147             else if (*cur == '\r')
1148             {
1149               if (cur[1] == '\n')
1150                 cur ++;
1151             }
1152             else if (*cur != '\n')
1153               *valptr++ = *cur;
1154           }
1155           else
1156             *valptr++ = *cur;
1157         }

```

Line 1085 contains the case statement which provides the logic used to iterate through the given string.

On line 1091, the for loop within the case statement is used to iterate through each character after encountering an open paranthesis character (0x28), storing the pointer to the current character in cur.

On line 1111, the code checks if the current character is a backslash and finally, in line 1117, the character index is incremented without checking the length, now pointing to the null byte terminating the string.

Upon the next iteration of the loop, on line 1094, the loop now begins iterating through unallocated memory resulting in undefined behaviour.

A Base64 encoded blob of an example PostScript document that can trigger the issue is below.

```
L///KFwAY3V1ZQ==

```
## Attacker Value

By providing this malformed PostScript document, an attacker could compromise the machine running the affected software, either CUPS or another application that uses the libppd library. Once compromised, this can provide an attacker a unique, privileged position in the targeted network.

# CVE-2023-4504: OpenPrinting CUPS/libppd Postscript Parsing Heap Overflow

[AHA!](https://takeonme.org/) has discovered an issue with CUPS and libppd from OpenPrinting, and is publishing this disclosure in accordance with AHA!’s standard [disclosure policy](https://takeonme.org/cve.html) today, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) has been assigned to this issue.

Any questions about this disclosure should be directed to cve@takeonme.org.

## Executive Summary

Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted CUPS document, CUPS version v2.5b1 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution. [CVE-2023-4504](https://takeonme.org/cves/CVE-2023-4504.html) appears to be an instance of [CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html), a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Technical Details

The scan\_ps function in the CUPS codebase provides functionality that scans through a string looking for the next Postscript object. When iterating through a string which contains an open parenthesis and ends with a single backslash (0x5c) character, the code incorrectly iterates forward a character without properly checking the bounds of the string resulting in a 1 byte read beyond the allocated heap buffer.

## Snippet of the vulnerable code:

cups/cups/raster-interpret.c

```
1039 static _cups_ps_obj_t   *               /* O  - New object or NULL on EOF */
1040 scan_ps(_cups_ps_stack_t *st,           /* I  - Stack */
1041         char             **ptr)         /* IO - String pointer */
1042 {
...
1085   switch (*cur)
1086   {
1087     case '(' :                          /* (string) */
1088         obj.type = CUPS_PS_STRING;
1089         start    = cur;
1090
1091         for (cur ++, parens = 1, valptr = obj.value.string,
1092                  valend = obj.value.string + sizeof(obj.value.string) - 1;
1093              *cur;
1094              cur ++)
1095         {
1096           if (*cur == ')' && parens == 1)
1097             break;
1098
1099           if (*cur == '(')
1100             parens ++;
1101           else if (*cur == ')')
1102             parens --;
1103

1105           {
1106             *ptr = start;
1107
1108             return (NULL);
1109           }

1116
1117             cur ++;

1119             if (*cur == 'b')
1120               *valptr++ = '\b';
1121             else if (*cur == 'f')
1122               *valptr++ = '\f';
1123             else if (*cur == 'n')
1124               *valptr++ = '\n';
1125             else if (*cur == 'r')
1126               *valptr++ = '\r';
1127             else if (*cur == 't')
1128               *valptr++ = '\t';
1129             else if (*cur >= '0' && *cur <= '7')
1130             {
1131               int ch = *cur - '0';
1132
1133               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1134               {
1135                 cur ++;
1136                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1137               }
1138
1139               if (cur[1] >= '0' && cur[1] <= '7')
1140               {
1141                 cur ++;
1142                 ch = (ch << 3) + *cur - '0';
1143               }
1144
1145               *valptr++ = (char)ch;
1146             }
1147             else if (*cur == '\r')
1148             {
1149               if (cur[1] == '\n')
1150                 cur ++;
1151             }
1152             else if (*cur != '\n')
1153               *valptr++ = *cur;
1154           }
1155           else
1156             *valptr++ = *cur;
1157         }

```

Line 1085 contains the case statement which provides the logic used to iterate through the given string.

On line 1091, the for loop within the case statement is used to iterate through each character after encountering an open paranthesis character (0x28), storing the pointer to the current character in cur.

On line 1111, the code checks if the current character is a backslash and finally, in line 1117, the character index is incremented without checking the length, now pointing to the null byte terminating the string.

Upon the next iteration of the loop, on line 1094, the loop now begins iterating through unallocated memory resulting in undefined behaviour.

A Base64 encoded blob of an example PostScript document that can trigger the issue is below.

L///KFwAY3V1ZQ==

## Attacker Value

By providing this malformed PostScript document, an attacker could compromise the machine running the affected software, either CUPS or another application that uses the libppd library. Once compromised, this can provide an attacker a unique, privileged position in the targeted network.
