## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory < 1.2.3 - Improper escaping of LDAP entries

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape data returned from the LDAP server before rendering it in the page, allowing users who can control their entries in the LDAP directory to inject malicious javascript which could be used against high-privilege users such as a site admin.

### Proof of Concept

Add a rogue record to a user on the LDAP server, something like:
dn: cn=xssman,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uuid: xssman
givenName: XSS man
description: XSS man <img src/onerror=alert(4)>
In the page with the [miniorange\_ldap\_directory\_search] shortcode, click search or search specifically for xssman to trigger the payload.

### Affects Plugins
