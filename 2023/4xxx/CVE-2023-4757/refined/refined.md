- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape data retrieved from the LDAP server before displaying it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which could be used against high-privilege users, such as site administrators, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can inject malicious code into LDAP entries that are displayed by the plugin
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to control their entries in the LDAP directory, which allows them to inject malicious Javascript. An authenticated user can then trigger the exploit.
