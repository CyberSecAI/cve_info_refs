- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly check user permissions when deleting messages in the "all-users messenger" functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) leading to broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-administrator user, specifically a user with the "subscriber" role or higher, can delete messages from the all-users messenger.
- **Attack vectors**: By intercepting a request made by the messenger (which runs at 3-second intervals) and manipulating the request parameters, a user can delete messages. The attacker needs to change the `message time` argument to `true` and also specify `true` for `permission to delete a comment`. e.g. `{"userid":2,"delete":{"1690817948":true},"submit_delete":true}`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site and be able to interact with the messenger.
