The provided content describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities in the TOTOLink EX1200L router firmware.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of input validation in several `cgi-bin` functions that directly use user-supplied data in OS commands.

**Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **OS command injection in `setDiagnosisCfg`:**
    *   The `setDiagnosisCfg` function uses the `Ping Address` value without validation in a `ping` command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
2.  **OS command injection in `traceroute`:**
    *   The `setTracerouteCfg` function uses the `Trace Address` value without validation in a `traceroute` command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
3.  **Blind OS command injection in hostname via `setWanCfg`:**
    *   The `setWanCfg` function uses the `Host Name` value without validation in an `echo` command to set the hostname, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the router with root privileges. This could lead to:
*   Full control of the router
*   Malware installation
*   Data exfiltration
*   Denial of service
*   Network compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities can be exploited via unauthenticated HTTP requests to the router's `cgi-bin` interface, as the firmware version is old (2020).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This could be either from the local network or potentially from the internet if the router's web interface is exposed. No prior authentication is needed.
