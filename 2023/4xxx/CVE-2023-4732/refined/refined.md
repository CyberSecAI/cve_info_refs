{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists when a task migrates pages while another task attempts to release the same pages using exit_mmap().",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Race condition",
     "Use-after-free"
    ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "This can lead to a use-after-free condition and trigger a BUG, resulting in a denial of service due to a kernel panic.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local user privileges are required to trigger the race condition. The specific method of triggering this bug is related to a low-level memory management mechanism in the kernel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local user privileges on the system."
