## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Orders Tracking for WooCommerce < 1.2.6 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Access/Read

### Description

The plugin doesn't validate the file\_url parameter when importing a CSV file, allowing high privilege users with the manage\_woocommerce capability to access any file on the web server via a Traversal attack. The content retrieved is however limited to the first line of the file.

### Proof of Concept

As an admin, open the following URL
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woo-orders-tracking-import-csv&step=mapping&file\_url=/etc/passwd
Change the file\_url parameter to a file on the web server and observe that the plugin will display the first line of the file in each of the "Column name" dropdowns.
