The provided content relates to CVE-2023-4216.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Orders Tracking for WooCommerce` plugin fails to validate the `file_url` parameter when importing a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The lack of validation on the `file_url` parameter allows attackers to access arbitrary files on the web server using directory traversal techniques.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: Attackers can read the contents of files on the server. However, the content retrieved is limited to the first line of the file.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific URL with the `file_url` parameter set to a file path on the server.
- The attacker must be logged in as a user with `manage_woocommerce` privileges, typically admin level.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- High privilege user with `manage_woocommerce` capability.
- Ability to send HTTP GET requests.
