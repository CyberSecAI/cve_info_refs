- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can store a malicious JavaScript payload via GET and POST methods on multiple parameters in the *MailAdmin\_dll.htm* file. This could lead to various malicious activities when other users interact with the stored payload, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring a user to interact with the malicious payload stored on the server. An attacker can inject the malicious JavaScript payload by sending crafted GET and POST requests to the vulnerable *MailAdmin\_dll.htm* file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send GET and POST requests to the vulnerable application, but no specific privileges are mentioned. The attack requires a victim to interact with the stored payload; user interaction is required as part of the attack chain.
