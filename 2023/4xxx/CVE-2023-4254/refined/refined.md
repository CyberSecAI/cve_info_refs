- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high privilege user, like an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with admin privileges can insert a malicious payload into the "Welcome to FAQ Section" field in the plugin's language settings. The injected script is then executed when users view the FAQ section on the frontend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have admin level access to the WordPress dashboard.
