## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Chatbot < 4.7.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS in Language Settings

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. In the plugin settings, select "WPBot Lite > Settings > Change Language"
2. Select "FAQ" and in the "Welcome to FAQ Section" enter the payload `<script>alert(2)</script>`
3. Access the FAQ on the frontend to see XSS.

### Affects Plugins
