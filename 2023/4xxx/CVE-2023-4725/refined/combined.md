## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Posts Ticker < 1.1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Settings > Simple Posts Ticker > Styles"
2. Add the payload `3px;"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` for the "Ticker Border Width"
3. Save the settings and navigate back to the page to see the XSS.

Fixed in 1.1.6
