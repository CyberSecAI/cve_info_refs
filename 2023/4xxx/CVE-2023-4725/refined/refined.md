- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High privilege users (like admin) can perform Stored XSS attacks, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By modifying plugin settings, specifically the "Ticker Border Width", with malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress dashboard.
