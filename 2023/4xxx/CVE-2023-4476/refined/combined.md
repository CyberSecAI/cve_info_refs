## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Locatoraid Store Locator < 3.9.24 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the lpr-search parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Setup (as admin):
- Locatoraid > Configuration > Google Maps > Enter "none" at Google Maps Browser API Key and Save
- Locatoraid > Publish > Add New (Pages with block) > Insert Shortcode [locatoraid] and Publish
- Go to Appearance > Widgets > Add block Locatoraid Search Form to Footer Area
Attack (as unauthenticated)
Open or make a logged in user open the following URL: http://example.com/?lpr-search="onfocus=alert(/XSS/) autofocus "
