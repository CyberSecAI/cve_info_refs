{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin provides an AJAX endpoint for configuring settings. This endpoint lacks capability checks and doesn't sanitize user input, which is later output without escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any authenticated user (e.g., subscriber) can inject malicious scripts that execute when the page is viewed, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted request to the plugin's AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=update_settings...`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least 'subscriber' privileges."
