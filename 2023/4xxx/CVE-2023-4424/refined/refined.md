- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in the `le_advertising_report` function when processing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer overflow: The `data_len` variable is calculated as `adv->len - BDADDR_SIZE`. When `adv->len` is smaller than `BDADDR_SIZE`, the subtraction underflows, resulting in a large positive value being stored in the `uint8_t data_len` variable due to wraparound.
    - Buffer overflow: The `memcpy` operation uses the overflowed `data_len` value as the number of bytes to copy, causing it to read beyond the intended bounds of the source buffer (`adv->adv_ind.data`) and write beyond the allocated space for the destination buffer (`adv_info->data`), leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious BLE device can cause a buffer overflow by sending a malformed advertising packet to a Zephyr OS device, potentially leading to a crash.
    - Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE): In some circumstances, a buffer overflow may allow an attacker to overwrite memory in a way that leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can send a malformed BLE advertising packet to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be within BLE range of the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker needs the ability to craft and send malicious BLE advertising packets.
