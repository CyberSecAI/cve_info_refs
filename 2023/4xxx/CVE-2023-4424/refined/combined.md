# bt: hci: DoS and possible RCE

High

[ceolin](/ceolin)

## Package

zephyr

## Affected versions

<= 3.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The function le\_advertising\_report in /subsys/bluetooth/controller/hci/hci.c does not process the

advertising packet properly when copying data.

An malicious bLE device can cause buffer overflow by sending malformed advertising packet BLE device

using Zephyr OS, leading to DoS or potential RCE on the victim BLE device.

### Details

The code that cause buffer overflow is function le\_advertising\_report in

/subsys/bluetooth/controller/hci/hci.c.

In the following code, there are three lines of code that are the main causes of buffer overflow, labeled as

(1) and (2).

```
static void le_advertising_report(struct pdu_data *pdu_data,
struct node_rx_pdu *node_rx,
struct net_buf *buf)
{
const uint8_t c_adv_type[] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x03, 0xff, 0x04,
0xff, 0x02 };
struct bt_hci_evt_le_advertising_report *sep;
struct pdu_adv *adv = (void *)pdu_data;
struct bt_hci_evt_le_advertising_info *adv_info;uint8_t data_len;
uint8_t info_len;
int8_t rssi;
...
if (adv->type != PDU_ADV_TYPE_DIRECT_IND) {
// (1) - Integer overflow
data_len = (adv->len - BDADDR_SIZE);
} else {
data_len = 0U;
}
info_len = sizeof(struct bt_hci_evt_le_advertising_info) + data_len +
sizeof(*prssi);
sep = meta_evt(buf, BT_HCI_EVT_LE_ADVERTISING_REPORT,
sizeof(*sep) + info_len);
...
adv_info = (void *)(((uint8_t *)sep) + sizeof(*sep));
...
adv_info->length = data_len;
// (2) - Buffer overflow
memcpy(&adv_info->data[0], &adv->adv_ind.data[0], data_len);
...
}
```

(1) - Integer overflow

The value of adv->len is 1 and BDADDR\_SIZE is equal to 6.

Since the type of data\_len is uint8\_t, the result of (adv->len - BDADDR\_SIZE) will finally equal to

251 and save it into data\_len . This is obviously an integer overflow, the value of adv->len should

be checked before this line.(2) - Buffer overflow

In this case, when I was debugging with central\_hr with gdb, I saw the maximum size of buf is 45, so

copy 251 bytes into &adv\_info->data[0] will definitely lead to buffer overflow

`le_mesh_scan_report` and `le_ext_adv_legacy_report` in `/subsys/bluetooth/controller/hci/hci.c` have

same vulnerable code pattern like le\_advertising\_report . I also observed buffer overflow occurring in

le\_ext\_adv\_legacy\_report , but it did not trigger a crash. The reason for this is that overflow data does

not overwrite data used by other functions.

Although these two functions did not trigger a crash during my tests, it should still be considered as

vulnerabilities. Since data layout depends on configuration, buffer overflow may triggered under certain

configuration.

### Impact

An malicious bLE device can cause buffer overflow by sending malformed advertising packet BLE device

using Zephyr OS, leading to DoS or potential RCE on the victim BLE device.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
