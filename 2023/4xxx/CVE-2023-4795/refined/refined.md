- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor role can inject malicious scripts via shortcode attributes. These scripts can then be executed when a higher privileged user (like an admin) views the affected page.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted shortcode attribute, specifically `link` and `name` attributes within `[tss_item]` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to have a user account with at least the Contributor role in the WordPress system to inject the malicious shortcode.
