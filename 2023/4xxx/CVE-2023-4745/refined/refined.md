**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. In this case, the specific url is <https://103.121.164.62:8443/importexport.php>.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject SQL queries through the `sql` parameter.
- No authentication is mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability may be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content gives a concrete Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the SQL injection. By using the following request, an attacker can retrieve the database name and version:
  `<https://103.121.164.62:8443/importexport.php?sql=c2VsZWN0IDEsZGF0YWJhc2UoKSx2ZXJzaW9uKCk=&type=exportexcelbysql>`
