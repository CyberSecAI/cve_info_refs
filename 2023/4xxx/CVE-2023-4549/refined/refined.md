- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize IP addresses coming from the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends an HTTP login request with a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable WordPress login form.
