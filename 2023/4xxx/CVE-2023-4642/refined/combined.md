## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# kk Star Ratings < 5.4.6 - Rating Tampering via Race Condition

### Description

The plugin does not implement atomic operations, allowing one user vote multiple times on a poll due to a Race Condition.

### Proof of Concept

1- Install and activate kk Star Ratings.
2- Go to the page that displays the star rating.
3- Using Burp and the Turbo Intruder extension, intercept the rating submission.
4- Send the request to Turbo Intruder using Action > Extensions > Turbo Intruder > Send to turbo intruder.
5- Drop the initial request and turn Intercept off.
6- In the Turbo Intruder window, add "%s" to the end of the connection header (e.g. "Connection: close %s").
7- Use the code `examples/race.py`.
8- Click "Attack" at the bottom of the window. This will send multiple requests to the server at the same moment.
9- To see the updated total rates, reload the page you tested.
