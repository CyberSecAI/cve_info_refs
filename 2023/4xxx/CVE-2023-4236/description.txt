A flaw in the networking code handling DNS-over-TLS queries may cause `named` to terminate unexpectedly due to an assertion failure. This happens when internal data structures are incorrectly reused under significant DNS-over-TLS query load.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.0 through 9.18.18 and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.18-S1.
