Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-4595:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling URL parameters. Specifically, the software does not adequately prevent the use of certain characters (e.g., null bytes, line feeds, spaces, asterisks, and specific unicode characters) when constructing paths to files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information exposure due to insufficient input validation when handling special characters in the URL, which allows for the retrieval of arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as credential files, configuration files, and application files stored on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by appending specific characters (%00, %0a, %20, %2a, %a0, %aa, %c0, and %ca) to the end of the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the affected server and does not require prior authentication.
