The provided content relates to CVE-2023-4250.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions being performed with the privileges of a user who accesses the crafted URL, including high-privilege users such as administrators.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL with a malicious payload in the `keyword` parameter on specific plugin pages (Event Organizers, Event Types, Performers, Venues) and in the `ep_filter_date` parameter on the admin edit page of `em_event` post type. The payload executes when a user visits the crafted URLs, or in the case of the second PoC, mouses over a filter element.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit the URL or interact with specific elements on the page for the javascript to execute.
