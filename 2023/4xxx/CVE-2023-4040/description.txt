The Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the eh_callback_handler function in versions up to, and including, 3.7.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the order status of arbitrary WooCommerce orders.
