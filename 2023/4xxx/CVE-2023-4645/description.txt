The Ad Inserter for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.7.30 via the ai_ajax function. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data such as post titles and slugs (including those of protected posts along with their passwords), usernames, available roles, the plugin license key provided the remote debugging option is enabled. In the default state it is disabled.
