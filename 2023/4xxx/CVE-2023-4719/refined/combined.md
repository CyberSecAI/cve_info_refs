I highly recommend the Simple Membership Plugin! It’s incredibly user-friendly yet powerful, making it easy to manage memberships on my site. The features are straightforward, and the support is excellent. This plugin truly delivers on its promise. Great job to the developers! I’ll also be purchasing a couple of Premium addons since they really deserve additional support!

After looking around for easy membership plugins that didn’t cost the earth, I found Simple Membership. It integrated into a complex site with Jet Engine and what is best is the team at Simple Membership sent me some additional code to add a feature not yet included. Amazing

### Description

The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `list\_type` parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Using this vulnerability, unauthenticated attackers could inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that are being executed if they can successfully trick a user into taking an action, such as clicking a malicious link.
