The provided content details a SQL Injection vulnerability in SourceCodester Inventory Management System 1.0, specifically in the `product_data.php` file. This aligns with the characteristics of a typical CVE description.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `columns[1][data]` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `product_data.php` file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform boolean-based blind SQL injection to extract data from the database, including potentially sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted POST request to `app/ajax/product_data.php` with a malicious payload in the `columns[1][data]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and no authentication is explicitly mentioned as a prerequisite for the exploit.
