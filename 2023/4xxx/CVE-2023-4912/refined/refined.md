- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the inefficient rendering of complex Flowchart TB Mermaid diagrams within GitLab comments. Specifically, a crafted diagram with numerous interconnected nodes and edges leads to excessive CPU usage and prolonged page load times.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or resource management when processing Mermaid diagrams. The system fails to handle a large number of nodes and edges efficiently, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can post a malicious Mermaid diagram in any comment section (Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, Snippets, Wiki pages, Markdown documents, Epics), causing the affected page to load very slowly or become unresponsive, impacting the accessibility of the related resources. The excessive CPU usage further degrades system performance.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the comment functionality within GitLab. Attackers inject malicious Mermaid diagram code into comment fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires a valid GitLab account with the ability to post comments in various sections (Issues, Merge requests, etc.). No special privileges are required to initiate the attack.
