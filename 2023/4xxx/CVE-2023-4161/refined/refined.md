Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4161

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce check within the `SaveCustomField` function of the "WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder" plugin. This function allows users to create custom invoice fields, and the lack of a nonce check allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a nonce check in the `SaveCustomField` function, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could trick an administrator into performing actions, such as clicking a malicious link, which would trigger the creation of arbitrary custom invoice fields.
- The attacker can modify the custom fields of the plugin, potentially inserting malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form.
- **Malicious Link/Form:** The attack is initiated by a crafted request sent to the vulnerable endpoint, which is typically triggered by an administrator interacting with a malicious link/form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site.
- **Admin Interaction:** The attacker must lure an authenticated WordPress administrator into interacting with a malicious link or form.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint that is responsible for saving the custom fields (`wp_ajax_rednao_wcpdfinv_save_custom_field`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.91 of the plugin by adding a nonce check for the `SaveCustomField` function.
- The provided code snippets show the removal of the `add_action` call for `rednao_wcpdfinv_save_custom_field` in one diff and the code related to `SaveCustomField` in the other, which confirms the vulnerability and its fix.
- The Wordfence article confirms the CSRF vulnerability and includes the vector, description, and affected versions and patched version.
