- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which will be executed when a user views the affected page/post. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions, if the user has sufficient privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: By using specific crafted shortcode attributes, a malicious user can inject arbitrary javascript code that will be executed in the browser of the users viewing the page/post. The vulnerable attributes are `src`, `width`, `height`, `help`, `hl`, `qs`, `brand`, `lang`, `hhl`, `kb`, `lp`, `title`, `tourcta`, `maxzoom`, `minzoom`, `zoomtrans`, `mpv`, `filter`, `minimapfilter`, `copyright`, `ga`, and `aa`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least contributor role or higher on the WordPress site to be able to add/edit posts with the malicious shortcode.
