    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `calendly` shortcode and the attributes it accepts.
*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site to create or edit content that allows the inclusion of shortcodes.
*   **Knowledge of shortcode attributes:** Attackers must know which shortcode attributes are vulnerable to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
