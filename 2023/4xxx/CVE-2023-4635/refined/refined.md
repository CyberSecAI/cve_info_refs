Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `tab` parameter within the EventON plugin for WordPress. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means the malicious script is injected into a request and then reflected back to the user within the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially gaining access to user sessions and accounts.
*   **Clipboard Manipulation:** Attackers can steal clipboard content.
*   **Content Modification:** Attackers can change the content of the web page, such as modifying download links to distribute malware or carry out phishing attacks.
*   **Keylogging:** Attackers can install keyloggers to capture user input.
*   **Phishing and Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites or implant advertisements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `tab` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user (e.g., an administrator or other site user) into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to click on a specially crafted link.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable parameter is `tab`.
* The malicious payload is injected in the URL, e.g.:
  `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eventon&tab="oNmOuSeOvEr=prompt(1)//`
  or
  `/wp-admin/admin.php? page=eventon&tab="oNmOuSeOvEr=alert(document.cookie)//`

**Affected Software:**

*   **Plugin:** EventON - Events Calendar
*   **Versions:**  Versions up to and including 2.2.2 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Update Plugin:** Update the EventON plugin to version 2.2.3 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a detailed test process involving Burp Suite, which is helpful for understanding how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The content also includes recommended remediation which includes input validation and output encoding and emphasizes not relying solely on blacklist filtering and double decoding prevention.
