- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DoLogin Security plugin does not properly restrict access to a widget displaying IP addresses of failed login attempts. This allows low-privileged users (such as subscribers) to view this sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive Data Disclosure (CWE-200), specifically the leakage of IP addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of IP addresses related to failed login attempts, which could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as identifying users or targeted attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: A subscriber or other low-privileged user can access the vulnerable widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a subscriber level account on the affected WordPress site and access the admin dashboard.
