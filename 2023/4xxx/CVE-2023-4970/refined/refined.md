The provided content relates to CVE-2023-4970.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in its settings, specifically the "Title" field when creating a new table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page, potentially leading to:
  - Account takeover
  - Data theft
  - Malware distribution
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious XSS payload into the "Title" field when creating a new table via the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pyt-tables&tab=tables-new`).
- When users view the table list (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pyt-tables&tab=tables`), the stored payload is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges (Admin+) within the WordPress instance to create or modify tables in the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel.
