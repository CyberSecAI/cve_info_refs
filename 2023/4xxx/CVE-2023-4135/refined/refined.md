{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing validation of a host-provided offset in the `nvme_fdp_events()` function within QEMU's NVMe emulation. This function is used to retrieve Flexible Data Placement (FDP) events log. The lack of proper validation allows for an out-of-bounds memory read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory read",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. It can also result in information disclosure due to arbitrary heap memory being exposed through the out-of-bounds read.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker within the guest system"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest operating system. Flexible Data Placement mode (fdp=on) must also be enabled to trigger the vulnerable code path.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in QEMU versions prior to 8.1.0, and only exploitable when Flexible Data Placement (FDP) mode is enabled."
