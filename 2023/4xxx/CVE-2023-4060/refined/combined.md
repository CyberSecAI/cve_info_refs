## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Adminify < 3.1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Several fields in the plugin are vulnerable to stored XSS when using the payload:
`<img src=x onerror=confirm(/XSS/)>`
Affected fields include Customizer fields:
- "Notification Bar -> Content" (view site on frontend to see XSS)
- "Logo -> Logo Link -> Edit Link -> Link Text" (view site in WP Admin to see XSS)
WP Adminify Settings:
- "Admin Columns > Post Types > Post > Title"
- "Admin Columns > Taxonomies > Category > Title"

### Affects Plugins
