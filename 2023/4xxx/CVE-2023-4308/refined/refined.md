Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-4308:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `user-submitted-content` parameter in the User Submitted Posts WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the lack of proper sanitization of the `user-submitted-content` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `user-submitted-content` parameter of the User Submitted Posts plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They can remotely inject malicious code through the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the User Submitted Posts plugin up to and including 20230809.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 20230811.
- The patch included the removal of the `$custom` variable from the `usp_reset_button_shortcode()` function, which seems to have been related to the sanitization issue although it's not explicitly explained.
- The `user-submitted-content` parameter is not specifically mentioned in the provided patch details, but the vulnerability is associated with it in the Wordfence description, indicating that the patch also fixed the XSS issue.
