Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-4956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `config-editor` page of Quay is vulnerable to clickjacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clickjacking:** The application lacks sufficient protection against clickjacking attacks. This means an attacker can overlay the vulnerable page with a transparent or opaque layer to trick users into interacting with it unintentionally.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can trick an administrator user into clicking buttons on the `config-editor` page.
*   This could lead to unauthorized reconfiguration of parts of the Quay instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is carried out by embedding the vulnerable `config-editor` page into another malicious page using iframes or similar techniques.
*   The attacker then overlays the embedded page with transparent or opaque layers to make it appear as something else to the victim.
*   The user, believing they are interacting with the top-level page, inadvertently clicks on elements of the embedded `config-editor` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create and host a web page that can embed the vulnerable `config-editor` page.
*   The attacker needs to lure an authenticated administrator user to visit the malicious web page.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the Quay server to carry out the attack, as the vulnerability lies in the client-side rendering of the webpage within the browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Bugzilla entry provides details about the vulnerability, including the affected component (`config-editor` page), and highlights its low severity.
*   The Bugzilla entry mentions that the vulnerability was discovered during a pentest.
*   The Bugzilla entry also includes a link to the CVE-2023-4956 entry on Red Hat's security page.
