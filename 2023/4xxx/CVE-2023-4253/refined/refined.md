- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which allows high-privilege users to perform stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the FAQ settings. This script would then execute when users interact with the chatbot feature, potentially leading to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "WPBot Lite -> Setting -> FAQ Builder" settings page, where an attacker can input a malicious XSS payload into the FAQ query and answer fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high-privilege user roles to access the settings page. The attack is triggered on the front end when an unauthenticated user interacts with the chatbot and requests a FAQ that contains the malicious script.
