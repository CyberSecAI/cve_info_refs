Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The plugin "Prevent files / folders access" does not properly validate uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows users with administrator privileges to upload files of any type, including those with PHP extensions. This lack of validation is the primary vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site, including data theft, defacement, and further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
* **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious file with a PHP extension.
* **Direct Access:** The attacker then accesses the uploaded file directly via a web browser, triggering the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Administrator access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator in the WordPress admin panel.
* **Web browser:** The attacker needs access to a web browser to navigate to the upload page and the uploaded file.
