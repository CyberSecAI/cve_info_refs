- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate the profile picture file being uploaded, allowing any authenticated user (such as a subscriber) to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload due to lack of file validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) via uploaded malicious files.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated users, such as subscribers or WooCommerce customers, can upload files through the profile picture upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (subscriber or higher) and have the "Upload Profile Picture" option enabled in the plugin settings. The "Endpoints as:" setting also needs to be set to "theme". In versions >=1.3.0, the attacker needs to intercept the request and change the Content-Type of the uploaded file to "image".
