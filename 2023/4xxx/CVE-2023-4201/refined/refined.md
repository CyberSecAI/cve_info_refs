Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `ex_catagory_data.php` file. Specifically, the `columns[1][data]` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because the application constructs SQL queries using untrusted input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Time-Based Blind Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection used in the Proof of Concept (POC) is time-based blind injection. This is used because the application doesn't directly output the results of the query, but an attacker can infer information based on how long the application takes to respond.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Data Retrieval:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve all data from the database, including sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `ex_catagory_data.php` file.
*   **Manipulated Parameter:** The attack targets the `columns[1][data]` parameter within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft the malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `app/ajax/ex_catagory_data.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:**  `columns[1][data]`
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided code demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection attack to retrieve data character by character. It iterates through possible characters, injecting SQL queries that use the `sleep()` function. If the query is true, the server sleeps for a specified time, enabling the attacker to determine the character.
