- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for a critical function in the IGSS Update Service. This allows a local attacker to change the update source.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could change the update source, potentially leading to remote code execution by forcing an update containing malicious content. This could result in loss of control of the SCADA system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable IGSS Update Service.
