- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint to save a newsletter with malicious payload in `nldata` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated. They can send the malicious request without any prior access to the WordPress instance. The attacker can be remote.
