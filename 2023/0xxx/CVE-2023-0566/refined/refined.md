```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation for the cronjob interval, where it doesn't check if the provided interval value is a valid number, allowing an attacker to specify a non-numeric value which leads to an incorrect cron expression being generated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, specifically lack of validation for the numeric part of the cronjob interval.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate the cronjob interval, potentially causing unexpected or incorrect scheduling of cron jobs. This could lead to denial of service, improper execution of scheduled tasks, or other disruptions.",
   "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted cronjob interval value through the API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to modify cronjob configurations, likely requiring some level of authenticated access to the froxlor system."
