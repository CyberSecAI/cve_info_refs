- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions in the Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to lack of proper nonce validation on AJAX actions. This allows attackers to create and delete pages and potentially other actions by forging requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can potentially perform actions such as creating and deleting pages, by tricking a site administrator into clicking a malicious link. This can lead to unauthorized modifications to the website content and potentially wider damage
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that initiates the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link or action that a logged-in administrator will perform. They do not need any specific privileges on the WordPress system itself, only access to a channel to deliver the malicious action.
