- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cortex XDR agent on Windows devices stores the admin password in a way that allows it to be disclosed in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext exposure of sensitive information (agent admin password). This is a violation of CWE-319.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can disclose the agent admin password, which allows them to execute privileged `cytool` commands. This can be used to disable or uninstall the agent, leading to a loss of security monitoring/protection and potentially to system compromise if the attacker has further goals.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable Cortex XDR agent is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local system administrator privileges on the target Windows machine.
