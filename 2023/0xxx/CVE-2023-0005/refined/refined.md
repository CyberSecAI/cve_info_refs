- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in PAN-OS software allows an authenticated administrator to expose plaintext values of secrets stored in the device configuration and encrypted API keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (plaintext secrets and API keys)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or compromise of systems relying on exposed secrets.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the PAN-OS management interface
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator on the PAN-OS device.
