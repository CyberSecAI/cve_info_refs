- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize shortcode attributes before outputting them back on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the `location` attribute of the `store_locator_show` shortcode is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they view a page or post containing the vulnerable shortcode. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `location` attribute of the `store_locator_show` shortcode, which is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the page containing the shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role within WordPress to be able to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
