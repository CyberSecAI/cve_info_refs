- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly check if posts are public before displaying them via shortcodes. Specifically, the `su_post` and `su_posts` shortcodes allow any authenticated user (including subscribers) to access content, regardless of its privacy status (draft, private, password protected).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure Direct Object Reference: The plugin directly uses post IDs provided in the shortcodes without verifying the user's access permissions.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure:  It exposes the content of private, draft, and password-protected posts, as well as passwords in some cases.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including the content of private/draft posts and passwords for protected posts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting specific shortcodes within a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site (at least a subscriber). They can leverage the browser's developer console to send the malicious requests.
