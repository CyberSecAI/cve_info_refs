- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page/post, where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a page/post containing the vulnerable block, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a specific malicious string in the Additional CSS class(es) field of the "Smart Post Show" Gutenberg block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user with at least the "Contributor" role or above, who can create or edit posts/pages and embed the vulnerable block.
