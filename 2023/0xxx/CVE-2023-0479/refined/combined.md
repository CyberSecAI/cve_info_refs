## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Print Invoice & Delivery Notes for WooCommerce < 4.7.2 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS by echoing a GET value in an admin note within the WooCommerce orders page. This means that this vulnerability can be exploited for users with the edit\_others\_shop\_orders capability. WooCommerce must be installed and active. This vulnerability is caused by a urldecode() after cleanup with esc\_url\_raw(), allowing double encoding.

### Proof of Concept

http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=shop\_order&printed\_order=1&total=1&print\_url=%2522%253E%253Cscript%253Ealert%28document.domain%29%253C%252Fscript%253E%253Cp%252Bid%253D
