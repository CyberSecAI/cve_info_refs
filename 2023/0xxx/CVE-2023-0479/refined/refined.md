- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a `urldecode()` after cleanup with `esc_url_raw()`, allowing double encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin note within the WooCommerce orders page, leading to potential execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that injects code into the `print_url` parameter and tricking a user with the `edit_others_shop_orders` capability into clicking on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted URL, and the target user needs to have the `edit_others_shop_orders` capability. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
