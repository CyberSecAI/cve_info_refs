  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization checks and user input validation when constructing a file path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated arbitrary file download",
    "Missing authorization check",
    "Insufficient input validation",
	"Path Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `descarga_etiqueta.php` script with manipulated `path` and `filename` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any authentication or special access, they can be a remote unauthenticated user."
