- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write issue in Delta Electronics DOPSoft when processing malformed files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker introduces a malformed file to the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to introduce a malformed file to the software. This requires user interaction.
