* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.

## Description

Việc sử dụng nhiều plugin cho nhiều chức năng khác nhau là điều rất phổ biến với người dùng WordPress hiện nay. Điều này không chỉ chiếm dụng tài nguyên website mà còn làm giảm tốc độ tải trang, gây ảnh hưởng đến trải nghiệm khách hàng cũng như khả năng “leo hạng” của website trên công cụ tìm kiếm. Nắm bắt được điều đó, Chúng tôi đã cho ra đời bộ công cụ cần thiết giúp người dùng vận hành website hiệu quả. Cụ thể, chỉ với một plugin duy nhất, người dùng có thể sử dụng rất nhiều chức năng mà chúng tôi đã chọn lọc và tích hợp sẵn.

### Tính năng

A visual nightmare for a Wordpress plugin. The design and graphics do not match the Dashboard which makes the plugin difficult to use. The plugin loaded in incorrect language at first setup. The plugin is a bloated disaster full of graphics. My eyes hurt after using this plugin. The main goal of this plugin is to get you to buy their products it seems.

# Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Multiple WordPress Plugins

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Quick Event Manager : CVE-2023-23491 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 9.7.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the 'category' parameter of the 'qem\_ajax\_calendar' action, as the parameter is reflected in the response without prior filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function 'qem\_show\_calendar()' of the file 'legacy/quick-event-manager.php'.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=qem_ajax_calendar&category=</script><script>alert(1)</script>

```

---

**Login with Phone Number : CVE-2023-23492 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.4.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The 'ID' parameter of the 'lwp\_forgot\_password' action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS. Although the response is encoded in JSON, the Content-Type of the response is text/html which allows the exploitation of the vulnerability. This vulnerability is present in the './login-with-phonenumber.php' file in the 'lwp\_forgot\_password()' function.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=lwp_forgot_password&ID=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>

```

---

**WP Helper Lite : CVE-2023-0448 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-helper-lite/

**Affected Versions:** < 4.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The plugin displays all of the user's GET parameters in the response to the **surveySubmit** action without any filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function '**surveySubmit\_func()'** of the file '**includes/class-mbwp-helper.php**'

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=surveySubmit&aaa=xxx"><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter : CVE-2023-28664 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-meta-data-filter-and-taxonomy-filter/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.3.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The plugin appears to have an incorrect usage of the core function '**esc\_html\_\_**' which can lead to a reflected XSS via the '**tax\_name**' parameter.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mdf_get_tax_options_in_widget&tax_name=<svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Woo Bulk Price Update : CVE-2023-28665 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-bulk-price-update/

**Affected Versions:** < 2.2.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**page**' parameter to the **techno\_get\_products** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to a reflected XSS.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=techno_get_products&page=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**InPost Gallery : CVE-2023-28666 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/inpost-gallery/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.4.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**imgurl**' parameter to the **add\_inpost\_gallery\_slide\_item** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS which could be triggered against authenticated users.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=add_inpost_gallery_slide_item&imgurl="><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```
