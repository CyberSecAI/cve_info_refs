Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-0789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit `40515c74815ace394ab23c6c19cbb33fd49059cb` in the `phpMyFAQ` repository addresses a vulnerability related to the lack of sanitization of user-provided input. Specifically, it adds `strip_tags()` to sanitize the question and answer inputs in `ajaxservice.php`. Before this commit, these inputs were not being sanitized, potentially allowing for the injection of HTML or other malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the question or answer fields. This could allow them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when the content is displayed, or store malicious data in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a variety of impacts including:
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal user session cookies, gaining access to the user's account.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could be used to extract sensitive data from the user's browser.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content displayed to users.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Drive-by downloads could be initiated, infecting users with malware.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker could display fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `question` or `answer` fields via the `ajaxservice.php` interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to interact with the affected functionality, which likely involves submitting questions or answers through a form. This doesn't require special access or privileges beyond that of a normal user.

**Additional Details**
The patch uses `strip_tags` function which removes all HTML and PHP tags from a string. This prevents XSS by removing dangerous tags.
The commit adds sanitization to both the question and answer fields in ajaxservice.php
```php
$question = Filter::filterInput(INPUT_POST, 'question', FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW);
$question = strip_tags($question);
...
$answer = Filter::filterInput(INPUT_POST, 'answer', FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW);
$answer = strip_tags($answer);
```
This commit also handles cases with `main.enableWysiwygEditorFrontend` enabled, where the answer input is sanitized differently.
```php
if ($faqConfig->get('main.enableWysiwygEditorFrontend')) {
    $answer = Filter::filterInput(INPUT_POST, 'answer', FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS);
    $answer = html_entity_decode($answer);
} else {
    $answer = Filter::filterInput(INPUT_POST, 'answer', FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW);
    $answer = strip_tags($answer);
    $answer = nl2br($answer);
}
```
This shows that the vulnerability existed for both regular text input and wysiwyg editor modes prior to the patch.
