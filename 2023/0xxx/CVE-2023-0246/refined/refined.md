The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in ESPCMS P8.21120101.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The application fails to properly sanitize user input when adding content in the backend, specifically in the "function node" section. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browser of other users when they access the affected page in the backend. This could allow the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions within the context of the affected user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be logged in to the administrative backend and must access the "add content" functionality, specifically the function node area, where they can insert the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires valid administrative credentials to access the backend and use the affected functionality.
