- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to a Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and output escaping of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page/post. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes of the plugin. For example: `[wpfa color='red" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to have Contributor role or higher on the WordPress site to be able to create or edit content that includes the vulnerable shortcode.
