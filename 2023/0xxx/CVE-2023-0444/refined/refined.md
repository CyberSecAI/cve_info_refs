Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-0444:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master handles user authentication and password visibility. The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user ('User' in the 'Read Only User' group) can access the password of a higher-privileged user ('Administrator' in the 'Administrator' group).
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application exposes the base64-encoded password of the Administrator account within network traffic, specifically when a user navigates to the user management page.
*  **Insecure Handling of Credentials:** The application stores and transmits the administrator's password in a way that can be easily accessed by a lower-privileged user, with simple base64 decoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** By obtaining the Administrator account credentials, an attacker can gain full administrative control of the InfraSuite Device Master system.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With admin access, an attacker can perform a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, configuration changes, and disruption of services.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through network traffic during normal usage of the web UI.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the InfraSuite Device Master's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User Access:** The attacker needs a valid user account with the "Read Only User" privileges.
*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the web UI of the affected InfraSuite Device Master system.
*   **Network Monitoring:** The attacker can capture the network traffic between the user's browser and the server.

**Additional details:**
*   The password is not directly displayed in the UI but it is present in the network traffic.
*   The password is base64 encoded, making it easy to decode.
*   The vendor has not released a patch at the time of writing.
