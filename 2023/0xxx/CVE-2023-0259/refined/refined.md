The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0259.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL queries to potentially access sensitive information from the database. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality (C:H), although integrity and availability are not directly affected in this specific scenario.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using the `parse-media-shortcode` action and providing a specially crafted shortcode in the `shortcode` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs a user account with the "subscriber" role. This indicates a low privilege requirement. The attack is performed remotely, so no local access is needed.
