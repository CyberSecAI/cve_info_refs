- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Companion Sitemap Generator plugin fails to validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which are then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page. This can lead to various impacts, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a malicious shortcode with crafted attributes into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least the 'contributor' role on the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages with the vulnerable shortcode.
