{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin echoes unescaped form submissions using the 'mf_first_name' shortcode.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute when a victim visits a page containing the shortcode when the submission id is present in the query string.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted links with the form entry ID. The vulnerability is triggered when a victim visits a page with the vulnerable shortcode and the submission ID is in the URL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor level permissions in order to submit a crafted form submission and store the malicious script in the database."
