## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Formidable Forms < 6.1 - IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin uses several potentially untrusted headers to determine the IP address of the client, leading to IP Address spoofing and bypass of anti-spam protections.

### Proof of Concept

1. In WordPress's Settings > Discussion page, add your IP address to the Disallowed Comment Keys field. This will block form submissions from your IP address.
2. Submit the form, and intercept the request. Add the header `X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3` (you may change the IP address to any other address).
3. See that the form submission is not blocked.
