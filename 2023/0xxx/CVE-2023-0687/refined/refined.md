{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `__monstartup()` function in glibc allocates a buffer to store profiling data, including a hash table of arcs. The size of this hash table was incorrectly calculated, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect calculation of buffer size",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption due to writing beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or potential exploitation in specific scenarios.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when `monstartup()` and `moncontrol()` are explicitly called to collect statistics from modules compiled with specific profiling options. An attacker needs to manipulate application requests to trigger a function call near the end of the monitored address range, causing the buffer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to: 1) Trigger profiling by enabling `gmon` or similar profiling mechanisms. 2) Have knowledge of the application's address space. 3) Control execution flow to cause a function call near the end of the monitored address range. This may require additional vulnerabilities in the target application."

  "fixes": [
    {
      "commit": "801af9fafd4689337ebf27260aa115335a0cb2bc",
      "description": "The fix modifies the calculation of `p->fromssize` to use `ROUNDUP` to ensure the hash table buffer is large enough to accommodate the entries, preventing the overflow. It also corrects a related typo in the calculation of `kcountsize`."
