Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how user sessions are handled in `pyload`. Specifically, the session was not expiring correctly after a user was deleted from the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Persistence After User Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is that even after a user is deleted from the database, their active session remains valid. The application's authentication check only verifies that a session exists (by checking the presence of "name" and "authenticated" keys in the session) but fails to validate if the user still exists in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** If a user is deleted, their session should be immediately invalidated, preventing any future access by that user. This vulnerability allows a deleted user, if their session is still active, to potentially maintain access to the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** If the deleted user has administrative or other high-level privileges, an attacker who manages to maintain this session could potentially access resources and perform actions beyond the scope of a normal user. This is not explicitly stated, but is a potential risk based on the general nature of session related issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Session Reuse:** An attacker who is a deleted user can retain access if they have an active session at the time of deletion. If they are able to make web requests using this session they would retain the same level of access they had before they were deleted.
*   **Session Hijacking (Theoretical):** While not explicitly covered by this content, if a user's session is compromised prior to user deletion, a successful attacker could retain the level of access of the compromised session, even after the user is deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Must have had a valid user account:** The attacker must have had a valid account in the system at some point, and their session had to be active at the point of deletion.
*   **Active Session:** The attacker must have an active and unexpired session cookie at the time the user is deleted.

**Technical Details:**

The commit `c035714c0596b704b11af0f8a669352f128ad2d9` addresses this vulnerability with the following changes:

1.  **`src/pyload/core/api/__init__.py`:**
    *   The `user_exists` method is added to the API to check if a user exists in the database.

2.  **`src/pyload/core/database/user_database.py`:**
    *   The `user_exists` method is implemented to query the database for a given user.

3.  **`src/pyload/webui/app/helpers.py`:**
    *   The `is_authenticated` function is modified to check if the user exists in the database by calling `api.user_exists(user)`. This ensures that the user still exists before allowing access via an active session.

The fix ensures that when a user is deleted, their sessions are no longer considered valid by checking the database for the existence of the user with the stored username during the authentication process.

**Additional Notes:**

* The commit message "fix issue that caused the session not expire after user was deleted" clearly describes the vulnerability.
* The provided commit diff shows the code changes made to address this vulnerability.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and its fix, going further than the generic CVE description.
