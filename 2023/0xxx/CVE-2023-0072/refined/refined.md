The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of shortcode attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted shortcode, such as `[wcv_recent_products columns='1" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`.
- An attacker can inject the malicious shortcode via a page or post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role or higher to be able to create and embed malicious shortcodes in pages or posts.
