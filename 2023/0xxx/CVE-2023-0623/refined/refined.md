The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0623.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project (HMI) files, leading to out-of-bounds write operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787): The software writes data past the end of allocated memory buffers due to insufficient input validation. This occurs when parsing project files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Malicious project files: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious project files that trigger the out-of-bounds write when parsed by the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Local access: The attack requires local access to the system.
*   User interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction (opening a malicious project file).
*   No special privileges needed.
