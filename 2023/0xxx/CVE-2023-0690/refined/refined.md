Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A bug in HashiCorp Boundary versions 0.10.0 up to 0.11.2 caused newly rotated credentials for PKI-based worker authentication to not be encrypted using the configured Key Management Service (KMS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is that rotated credentials, intended to be encrypted with KMS, were stored in plaintext on the Boundary PKI worker's disk.
- **Incorrect KMS Encryption:** In some cases, credentials might be encrypted with the wrong KMS, making them unusable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials:** Attackers with access to the Boundary PKI worker's disk could gain access to plaintext credentials, potentially compromising the entire Boundary environment.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** If credentials are encrypted with the wrong KMS, it could lead to denial of service and loss of integrity as the credentials would be useless.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Disk Access:** An attacker would need access to the filesystem of a Boundary PKI worker to exploit this vulnerability. This might involve compromising the worker host itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Boundary Worker's Disk:** An attacker must have some form of access to the underlying filesystem where Boundary worker stores the rotated credentials.
- **Understanding of Boundary Configuration:**  While not strictly necessary to exploit, understanding the Boundary configuration might help an attacker target specific systems or identify the most valuable credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects systems using the PKI-based worker authentication method with a KMS configured for "worker-auth-storage".
- The issue was fixed in Boundary version 0.12.0.
- Remediation involves upgrading to 0.12.0 or newer and either waiting for the next worker authentication rotation or deleting and re-authorizing the worker.
- The vulnerability was identified by the Boundary engineering team.
