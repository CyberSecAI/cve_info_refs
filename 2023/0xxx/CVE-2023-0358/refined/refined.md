{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect condition when reading NAL units within a VVC configuration. Specifically, it's in the `gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs` function in `src/odf/descriptors.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code incorrectly assumes that if the NAL unit type is not a 'Decoder parameter set' (GF_VVC_NALU_DEC_PARAM) or an 'OPI' (GF_VVC_NALU_OPI) then a 16-bit value is available to read nalucount, this could potentially lead to read out of bounds or use of uninitialized value if no 16 bit value can be read or is not present"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability could be a crash or unexpected behavior due to out-of-bounds read/use-of-uninitialized value. While not explicitly stated, out of bounds read can cause denial of service or other unpredictable behaviours.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malformed VVC configuration that triggers the incorrect conditional in the `gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs` function. This would likely be done by providing specially crafted media files.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted media file (or stream) to the vulnerable application. This might happen by loading a malformed media file or tricking a user to open a malformed file."
