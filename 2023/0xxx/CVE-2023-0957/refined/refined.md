  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2023-0957",
    "description": "The vulnerability is a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability in Gitpod that allows a full account takeover through visiting a link. The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on the Origin header in WebSocket connections to the server component, combined with a SameSite cookie bypass.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the Origin header in WebSocket handshake requests and the ability to bypass SameSite cookie restrictions by using a subdomain of gitpod.io.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking",
      "Insufficient Origin header validation",
      "SameSite cookie bypass",
      "Lack of proper authentication in WebSocket exchange"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform a full account takeover. This includes access to the user's workspaces, ability to add SSH keys, and exfiltrate sensitive information such as access tokens.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted link to the victim that, when visited, triggers a WebSocket connection to the Gitpod server from an attacker-controlled workspace. The injected JavaScript then uses this connection to invoke privileged JSONRPC methods.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an active Gitpod workspace and the ability to serve a malicious HTML/JavaScript payload. They also need to entice a victim to visit the crafted link. ",
    "additional_details": "The attack leverages a SameSite cookie bypass by exploiting the fact that workspaces are hosted on subdomains of gitpod.io, thus being considered the same site. The attacker patches the VS Code server to serve a malicious payload at the /version endpoint, bypassing the intended use of the gitpod-cli."
