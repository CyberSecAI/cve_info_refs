- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP News plugin lacks CSRF protection when activating plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to induce a logged-in administrator to unintentionally activate a plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can activate arbitrary plugins present on the WordPress blog. This could lead to a variety of impacts, from adding unwanted functionality to complete compromise, depending on the plugin activated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable `action` and the target plugin's location as parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to make the crafted request, likely by social engineering, such as tricking them into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site.
