  "CVE-2023-0494": {
    "description": "A dangling pointer in DeepCopyPointerClasses can be exploited by ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo() and ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo() to read/write into freed memory.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "xorg-x11-server",
      "xorg-x11-server-Xwayland",
      "tigervnc"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the DeepCopyPointerClasses function within the X.Org X server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
          "Dangling Pointer",
          "Memory Corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "This vulnerability can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Local privilege elevation",
            "Remote code execution via ssh X forwarding"
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo()` and `ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo()` functions, either through local access or X forwarding.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to a dangling pointer after freeing memory in `DeepCopyPointerClasses`. This dangling pointer can then be used by `ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo()` and `ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo()` functions to read/write to freed memory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities"
