- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, potentially leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode using the `d3-source` shortcode with malicious `onmouseover` event, an attacker can inject malicious javascript which will execute when a user hovers over the element where the shortcode is used.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site to create/edit content with the vulnerable shortcode.
