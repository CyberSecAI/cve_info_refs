Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the mentioned pull request:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an older API for creating temporary files within the RESTEasy Reactive component of the Quarkus framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The older API used by RESTEasy Reactive for temporary file creation was creating temporary files with insecure permissions. This could potentially allow other users on the system to read or modify these files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If an attacker could gain access to these temporary files they might be able to gain access to sensitive data or use it to cause other issues within the application

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have access to the filesystem of the server or application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position that they could access and potentially modify files on the system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Additional Notes**
- The pull request #30694 aimed to fix this by migrating to a newer API that handles temporary file creation more securely.
- The fix was included in Quarkus version 2.16.1.Final and backported to 2.13.8.Final.
- The related CVE is [CVE-2023-0481](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/17557), specifically mentioning the insecure temporary file creation in `io.quarkus.resteasy.reactive:resteasy-reactive-common`.
