- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will be executed when a user views the page/post, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with the vulnerable plugin and including it in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create and publish content with the malicious shortcode.
