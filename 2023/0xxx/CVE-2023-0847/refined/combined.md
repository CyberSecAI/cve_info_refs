# Possible remote memory corruption over the DASH7 modem

Low

[glennergeerts](/glennergeerts)
published
GHSA-ggxh-88wc-c4fg
Nov 17, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0

## Patched versions

0.5.0

## Description

### Impact

A remote out of bounds write vulnerability was discovered in the DASH7 Alliance Protocol implementation of the Sub-IoT stack. A remote attacker could craft a malicious packet which could overwrite max 255 bytes in a statically allocated memory structure. In the default configuration, the overflow region does not contain any function pointers and since this variable is not allocated on the stack, we think it is not possible to trigger a remote code execution in any way. Users who reconfigured the `MODULE_D7AP_PACKET_QUEUE_SIZE` to 2 (from the default value 3) might be able to overwrite other memory contents, depending on other options and the compiler toolchain and settings used.

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in the [0.5.0 release](https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack/releases/tag/0.5.0).

### Credits

The vulnerability was discovered with the help of [Firmalyzer's](https://www.firmalyzer.com/baremetal-firmware-analysis/) automated firmware analysis engine.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open an issue in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack) or send a message in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Sub-IoT/community).

ICS Advisory
# Sub-IoT DASH 7 Alliance Protocol stack implementation

Release DateFebruary 16, 2023
Alert CodeICSA-23-047-13

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 5.3**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Sub-IoT project
* **Equipment:** DASH 7 Alliance Protocol stack implementation
* **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an out-of-bounds write condition.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of the Sub-IoT implementation of the Dash7 Alliance protocol, a low power, sub-GHz Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocol, are affected:

* Sub-IoT DASH 7 Alliance protocol implementation: All versions prior to 0.5.0

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

**3.2.1 [OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**

The Sub-IoT implementation of the DASH 7 Alliance protocol has a vulnerability that can lead to an out-of-bounds write. If the protocol has been compiled using default settings, this will only grant the attacker access to allocated but unused memory. However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code execution.

[CVE-2023-0847](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0847) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** N/A

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Behrang Fouladi of Firmalyzer reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Sub-IoT recommends users reinstall with [version 0.5.0](https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack/commit/9f518bffbf725be93e5e40a0efc544808e93e37a) or later.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
