Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-0871:

**CVE-2023-0871:** The provided content directly addresses a fix for **CVE-2023-0871**, which is related to external XML entity (XXE) loading vulnerability in OpenNMS.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of XML input, specifically the ability to load external XML entities. This allows an attacker to potentially access local files or other resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection, where the system processes external entities defined within XML data. This allows for the inclusion of malicious external content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read local files from the server.
- **Denial of Service:** In certain cases, the parsing of external entities could lead to a denial-of-service condition by overloading the server.
- **Other Attacks:** In some environments, this might facilitate other attacks depending on the network configuration and local resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through a specific endpoint `/rtc/post`. It's mentioned that the default `rtc` credentials might be used to exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the `/rtc/post` endpoint.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to use the default `rtc` credentials or have obtained other valid credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix was implemented as part of the NMS-15699 Jira ticket and included in the OpenNMS release.
- The vulnerability was reported by an external researcher, Moshe Appelbaum.
- The fix is aimed at preventing external XML entity loading.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content also indicates that this fix was included in the Horizon 32.0.2 release.
- This release includes other security fixes for other vulnerabilities, but this specific issue is regarding XXE.
- The fix was backported to the `foundation-2023` branch, meaning it's also available in newer versions.

In summary, the content provides information on a critical security vulnerability (XXE) that was present in OpenNMS, the mechanism of its exploitation, and the patch that resolves the vulnerability.
