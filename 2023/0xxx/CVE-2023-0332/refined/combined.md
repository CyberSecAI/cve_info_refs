# Online Food Ordering System manage\_user.php has SQLinject

Download the source code from

<https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16022/online-food-ordering-system-v2-using-php8-and-mysql-free-source-code.html>

The source code of the vulnerability is located in admin/manage\_user.php

[![image-20230117104630076](/qyhmsys/cve-list/raw/master/images/image-20230117104630076.png)](/qyhmsys/cve-list/blob/master/images/image-20230117104630076.png)

Because the string entered by the user is not filtered and the sql statements are spliced, the sql injection vulnerability is generated. It can cause serious harm to the system.

Use browser for vulnerability verification:

Use sqlmap for vulnerability verification:
