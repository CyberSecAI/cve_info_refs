Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries within the `admin/manage_user.php` file of the "Online Food Ordering System" application. This is a classic case of SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because the application does not filter or sanitize user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Serious Harm to the System:** The document explicitly states that this vulnerability "can cause serious harm to the system." While not detailed, it implies potential consequences like:
    *   Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database (e.g., user credentials, order details, financial data).
    *   Data modification or deletion, leading to loss of integrity and system malfunction.
    *   Complete system compromise, allowing attackers to gain control over the application's server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input, likely via a web form or URL parameter that is processed by the `manage_user.php` script. The specific input fields vulnerable are not detailed.
*   **SQL Query Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into these input fields, which is then executed by the database, allowing them to control the database operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable web application and input malicious SQL strings into vulnerable input fields.
*   **No Authentication Requirement:**  Based on the screenshots provided, it appears that the SQL injection vulnerability might be accessible without any prior authentication (although this isn't explicitly confirmed)
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand the principles of SQL injection to craft effective malicious code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The document includes screenshots of successful SQL injection attempts, both using a web browser and with `sqlmap`, a penetration testing tool.
