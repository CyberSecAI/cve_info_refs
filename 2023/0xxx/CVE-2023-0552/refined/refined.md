- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate the redirection URL when logging in and logging out.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website after login or logout. This could be used in phishing attacks or to trick users into visiting malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `redirect_to` parameter during login and the `piereg_logout_url` and `redirect_to` parameters during logout.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect target. No user authentication or special privileges are needed, although for login redirection the user needs to attempt to log in to the website.
