- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting designations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF check on the designation deletion functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary designations by tricking them into submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor crafts a webpage containing a form that submits a deletion request to the vulnerable plugin. When a logged-in administrator visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, deleting the specified designation without the administrator's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious webpage.
