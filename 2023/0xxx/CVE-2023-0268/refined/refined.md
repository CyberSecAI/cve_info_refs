- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post. Specifically, the `link` attribute in the `vc_testimonial` shortcode is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by users with "contributor" role or higher by crafting malicious shortcodes and embedding them in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress site to be able to create or modify posts/pages and embed shortcodes.
