- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape folder names, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they interact with the malicious folder, such as when uploading files to it. This could result in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the 'author' role or higher creates a folder with a malicious payload (e.g., `"><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`). When a user interacts with that folder by uploading a file to it, the injected JavaScript executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least the author role within the WordPress instance. They also need to have access to the media library to create the folder with the malicious payload.
