- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users with the contributor role and above can perform Stored XSS attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in the attributes into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges on the WordPress site to create/modify pages/posts with the vulnerable shortcode.
