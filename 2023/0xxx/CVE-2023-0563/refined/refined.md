{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `ahname` parameter when adding a locker. This allows for the injection of malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS). The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS in the `manage-locker-form.php` page.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of an administrator or other user when they view the locker information. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, phishing, or redirecting users to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted `ahname` parameter in the locker addition form. The malicious payload is injected into the system when a user adds a new locker through `add-locker-form.php` and is triggered when an admin views the locker through the manage page (`manage-locker-form.php`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a locker as a regular user and input a malicious payload within the `ahname` parameter. The attacker would also need access to the admin panel where the injected payload will trigger the vulnerability."
