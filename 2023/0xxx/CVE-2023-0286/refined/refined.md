Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-0286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a type confusion in how X.400 addresses are processed within an X.509 `GeneralName`.
-  X.400 addresses were parsed as `ASN1_STRING`, but the `GENERAL_NAME` structure incorrectly defined the `x400Address` field as `ASN1_TYPE`.
- The `GENERAL_NAME_cmp` function in OpenSSL interprets this field as an `ASN1_TYPE` instead of `ASN1_STRING`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Type Confusion:** The mismatch between the parsed data type (`ASN1_STRING`) and the interpreted type (`ASN1_TYPE`) in `GENERAL_NAME_cmp` leads to incorrect memory access.
- **Incorrect Function Call**: The `GENERAL_NAME_cmp` function tries to use a memcmp with potentially arbitrary pointers, leading to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Exposure:** An attacker could potentially read memory contents by passing arbitrary pointers to a `memcmp` call.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a crash due to invalid memory access, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker must be able to provide both a certificate chain and a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).
- Neither the certificate nor the CRL needs to have valid signatures for the attack to work.
- If only one of these inputs (certificate or CRL) is controlled, the other must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point which is uncommon, making the vulnerability harder to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to control the certificate chain and CRL (or at least one of them, given the other one contains x400 address as CRL distribution point) used by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be on-path, as it is enough to provide the malicious inputs to the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerable application must be using OpenSSL for CRL checking (i.e., it sets the `X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK` flag) and also use a custom way to retrieve CRLs over the network.

**Affected Versions:**

- OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 before 3.0.8
- OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 before 1.1.1t
- OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 before 1.0.2zg

**Additional Technical Details and Observations:**

- The vulnerability exists within the `crypto/x509v3/v3_genn.c` file, specifically in the `GENERAL_NAME_cmp` function.
- The fix involves modifying the public header file definition of `GENERAL_NAME` so that `x400Address` is declared as type `ASN1_STRING` which reflects how the data is internally parsed.
- The advisory mentions that existing applications using the previous `ASN1_TYPE` definition would have been unsuccessful, and there is no ABI change with the fix.
- The issue was present since OpenSSL 0.9.7 but became reachable from X.509 CRL handling (and likely the Time-Stamp Protocol) in OpenSSL 1.0.0.
- The vulnerability is triggered by using an "exotic" curve encoding.
- The OpenSSL code that parses the input is not affected by the fix and is in the file `crypto/asn1/tasn_*.c`.
- Red Hat claimed that their openssl on RHEL6 is not vulnerable although source code still has GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function with the same code fragment. It is suggested that RedHat might have made that decision based on the information in the advisory that OpenSSL 1.0.1 is not mentioned.
