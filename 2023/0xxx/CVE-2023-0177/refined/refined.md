- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page or post. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, account takeover, and data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** By using specially crafted shortcode attributes, a user with contributor role and above can inject malicious JavaScript into the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least a contributor role on the WordPress website. They need the ability to create or edit posts/pages and embed shortcodes.
