Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Stylish Cost Calculator Premium plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website's database. These scripts are then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page (in this case, the submissions submitted through the Email Quote Form).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially compromise the accounts of administrators by injecting malicious JavaScript that executes when they view a quote submission. This could enable attackers to:
    - Steal administrator session cookies.
    - Redirect administrators to malicious sites.
    - Perform unauthorized actions on the website on behalf of the administrator.
    - Deface the website.
    - Potentially achieve full control over the affected WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated users** can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious quote via the email form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the Email Quote Form of the plugin. No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to inject the malicious script in the form's data.
- The victim (admin) needs to view the submission form through the admin panel for the XSS to trigger.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is within the data array, specifically the 'name' field.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) shows how to inject a script using the `onerror` event of an `<img>` tag.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.9.0 of the plugin.
