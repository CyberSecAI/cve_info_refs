- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection and proper sanitization and escaping of input parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing CSRF protection and inadequate input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browser of any user with sufficient privileges (Contributors and above) who access the affected pages/features, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uses a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack by crafting a malicious HTML form. When a logged-in admin visits the attacker-controlled page hosting this form, the form automatically submits the crafted payload to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious page containing the crafted form. The attacker does not need any prior authentication with the vulnerable site.
