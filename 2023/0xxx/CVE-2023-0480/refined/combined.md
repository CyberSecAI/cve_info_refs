                Where can I get a trial version of any of the plans?

To obtain a 15-day trial of any of our plans, send us an email to sales@vitalpbx.com.

         If I subscribe to a plan can I later migrate to another?

Yes, it is possible to migrate between plans, either from a monthly to yearly installment, or between whole plans.

         Can I have a demo so I can try VitalPBX?

        Is VitalPBX Multi-Tenant capable?

If you want more information go to [VitalPBX Multi-Tenant PBX.](https://vitalpbx.com/multi-tenant-pbx/)

         Does VitalPBX have mobility features for Remote Workers?

Yes. We have several solutions.

Our soft phone, [VitalPBX Connect](https://vitalpbx.com/vitalpbx-connect-pbx-app-ios-android/), you can install on Android or iOS.

[VitXi WebRTC](https://vitalpbx.com/vitxi-webrtc-softphone-client-for-vitalpbx/), that you can access from any browser, whether you are accessing from Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, or even from your mobile device.

We also have [VitalPBX Communicator](https://vitalpbx.com/vitalpbx-communicator/) which is a Call Center Oriented Soft phone for Windows.

You can see more information in the products section of our website.

        How many Tenants can I have on a single server?

This depends on the number of extensions that each Tenant has as well as the concurrent calls and if any Tenant is going to have a Call Center and call recordings.

Although we have some customers that have more than 100 Tenant per server, we recommend not having more than 100 per Server.

We cannot offer support to clients with more than 100 Tenans per server.

        Can different Tenants have the same exts? like Tenant A 101 and Tenant B 101?

Yes, what changed is the name of the device in each Tenant, for example the extension 101 in Tenant A would have the device name (user) TA\_101 and in Tennat B it would have TB\_101 and so on.

                                                ![vitalpbx - best multi tenant pbx system based on asterisk](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MTUzMTo0NzM=-1;base64...)
