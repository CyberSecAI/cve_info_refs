## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Namaste! LMS < 2.5.9.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Namaste Settings, and at Payment Settings in the Payment currency field, put: "autofocus onfocus=alert(1)//
2. Go to yourpage.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=namaste\_options, and the alert will trigger.
