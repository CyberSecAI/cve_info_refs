- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website which will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a crafted shortcode with malicious attributes into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site.
