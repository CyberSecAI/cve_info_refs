- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions, specifically deleting records on the `wp_newsletter_show_localrecord` page, through a CSRF attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely by tricking a logged in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious website that will make a request to the vulnerable endpoint
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to click on a malicious link or visit a crafted website.
