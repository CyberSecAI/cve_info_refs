## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Newsletter Popup <= 1.2 - Record Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks as the wp\_newsletter\_show\_localrecord page is not protected with a nonce.

### Proof of Concept

https://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp\_newsletter\_show\_localrecord&action=delete&rid=1
