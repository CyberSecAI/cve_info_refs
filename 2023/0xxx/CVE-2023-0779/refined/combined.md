# net: shell: Improper input validation

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-9xj8-6989-r549
May 30, 2023

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

<= 3.2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Within <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/subsys/net/ip/net_shell.c> a command “net pkt”, is defined. The handler for this command, cmd\_net\_pkt, takes a string parameter to the function get\_net\_pkt. This string is converted to a number, and is cast to a pointer. Provided the input is a valid set of hex bytes of suitable length, the pointer will be returned without error. No attempt is made to verify the data pointed to is of the net\_pkt type. This pointer is then passed to the net\_pkt\_buffer\_info function. A while loop begins printing various values at offsets defined by the net\_pkt’s buffer struct for each buffer thought to be a fragment of the input packet pointer. The while loop concludes when the list of fragments encounters a null value and the function returns. The cmd\_net\_pkt calls one more function, net\_pkt\_buffer\_hexdump. This function dereferences the input pointer to identify the buffer pointer. For each fragment within the buffer, the data pointer and length are read and passed the shell\_hexdump function where each byte within the buffer’s data is printed to the shell.

The net pkt command seems to be available even when the kernel, device and devmem shell modules are disabled, and the shell configuration to reduce flash/memory usage is applied.

### Attack model

At the most basic level, an invalid pointer can be input that crashes the device, but with more knowledge of the device’s memory layout, further exploitation is possible.

In the case where a malicious actor can load some small amount of data into a known location in memory, the data interpreted as a header for the net\_pkt and net\_buf structs can be configured to not cause any unmapped memory to be accessed, the net\_buf data and len parameters could be configured to cover any content from the firmware or memory. Calling the vulnerable command with the known memory location as the input string would result in the shell\_hexdump command printing the firmware/memory content to the shell, without triggering a fault.

As a proof of concept (shown in the image below), we attempted to exploit a test firmware. Using a chosen parameter (0x3ffcbc30, pointing to inside of the text buffer for the current command) from our knowledge of the memory map, the net pkt command interprets $”@? as a member of a net\_pkt struct, pointing to a net\_buf struct. For the simplicity of the proof of concept, we manually placed a buffer in flash to act as our falsified net\_buf struct, but the required data could be loaded into other user manipulatable memory. A location and length are interpreted from this buffer, and the bytes at the entered location are printed to the console.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
