Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-0101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a privilege escalation issue in Tenable Nessus.
*   An authenticated attacker can execute a specially crafted file to gain elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a low-privilege, authenticated user to escalate to root or NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Code Execution:** This is achieved through the execution of a specially crafted file, implying a vulnerability in how Nessus handles or processes certain file types or content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the Nessus host with root or SYSTEM level privileges. This allows an attacker to potentially access and modify data, control the system, or use it as a foothold for further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need local system access to trigger this issue if they can authenticate.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the Nessus service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into Nessus, and exploit this.
*   **File Crafting:**  The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted file which can be executed in the context of the Nessus service.
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Nessus instance.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Nessus 8.x**: Versions 8.15.7 and earlier are vulnerable. Fixed in 8.15.8
*   **Nessus 10.x**: Versions 10.4.1 and earlier are vulnerable. Fixed in 10.4.2

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Tenable on 2022-12-29.
*   The fix for Nessus 8.x (8.15.8) and 10.x (10.4.2) was released on 2023-01-18.
