- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the page/post. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript embedded in its attributes. An attacker with Contributor or higher role can embed this shortcode into a post/page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to WordPress in order to create or edit posts/pages where the vulnerable shortcode can be placed.
