## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Stagtools < 2.3.7 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a Post and add a Shortcode.
2. Paste the stagcode in the input:
```
[stag\_icon icon="link" url="https://example.com/" size='100px' new\_window="no" style='test-style4 fa-link" onmouseover="alert(document.domain)" x="']
```
3. Save the post. Preview it. Hover your mouse over the icon.
