- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via the `wcff_clone_group` action within the WordPress admin panel (`edit.php`). The vulnerable parameter appears to be `post`. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within this parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges, such as an administrator, to exploit the vulnerability.
