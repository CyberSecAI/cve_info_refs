Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0554

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks proper nonce validation on its AJAX actions, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Additionally, there is a lack of post-type checks in the AJAX actions for updating and deleting menu items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Missing or incorrect nonce validation on AJAX actions allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions if they can trick a logged-in administrator into clicking on a malicious link.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Lack of post-type validation in AJAX actions allows for potential exploitation of arbitrary post data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can manipulate menu items.
*  An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary menu items.
*   An attacker could potentially modify website content by exploiting the ability to update menu items including titles, content, images and prices.

**Attack Vectors:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious request that would be executed by a logged-in administrator if the admin clicks on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They would need the ability to craft a malicious link or form that will be executed by a logged-in administrator.

**Additional Technical Details (from the source code):**
The provided code snippets show how the AJAX functions `erm_update_menu_item`, `erm_delete_menu_item`, and `erm_create_menu_item` are vulnerable. The functions use `$_POST` data directly without proper checks, allowing manipulation of data. 
*  The update function `erm_update_menu_item` lacks an nonce check, it was added in the patch. Also a check is added to make sure the post_id belongs to the type `erm_menu_item`.
*   The delete function `erm_delete_menu_item` lacks a nonce check, it was added in the patch. Also a check is added to make sure the post_id belongs to the type `erm_menu_item`.
* The create function `erm_create_menu_item` lacks a nonce check, it was added in the patch.

The `erm_update_list_menu_items` function also lacks a nonce check, it was added in the patch. Also a check is added to make sure the post_id belongs to the type `erm_menu`.

The patch also included an update to the plugin's `readme.txt` file, incrementing the version to 2.1.0.

The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the attacker's ability to entice a logged-in administrator to perform an action that would trigger the forged request.
