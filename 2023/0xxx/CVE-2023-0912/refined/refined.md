- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `view_transaction.php` page, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the `view_transaction.php` page via the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data access, modification, or even full system control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface by manipulating the `id` parameter within the URL: `?page=vehicles/view_transaction&id=*`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged user (employee) with access to the application can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the `view_transaction.php` page.
