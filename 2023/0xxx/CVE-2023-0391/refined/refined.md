Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-0391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the use of a hard-coded, static SSL certificate and private key that is identical across all installations of MGT-COMMERCE's CloudPanel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The primary vulnerability is the use of the same private key for the SSL certificate in every CloudPanel instance. This undermines the encryption provided by HTTPS.
2.  **CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs:** The CloudPanel installer overwrites existing firewall rules with overly permissive ones, opening up the server to broader access.
3. **Blank Superuser Account:** The superuser admin account is left blank upon installation, allowing an attacker to set the password if they act quickly enough.
4. **CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check:**  The initial installation method used "curl to bash" without a checksum. Although this was addressed by the vendor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Passive Decryption:** An attacker possessing the shared private key can passively decrypt HTTPS traffic to and from any CloudPanel server using that certificate. This includes sensitive data like admin passwords and session tokens.
2.  **Server Discovery:** The reused certificate makes it trivial for attackers to discover vulnerable CloudPanel servers by scanning for the matching certificate fingerprint, as described in the rapid7 report.
3.  **Complete System Compromise:** Chaining the above two issues together with the blank administrator account allows an attacker to find, gain control and fully compromise new CloudPanel servers shortly after they are deployed. This allows them to install malware, replace certificates, or alter the underlying OS as an authenticated administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Network Scanning:** Attackers can scan IP ranges for servers with the specific SSL certificate fingerprint (SHA-256: 6D 13 60 EC EF D5 01 F8 F4 91 C3 2D 41 91 48 9C E1 02 3E C8 E9 12 5D 96 AE A7 53 03 FB 62 4F 2B, SHA-1: 3B EC E0 7F F1 4C 84 22 E1 5E 2D 72 5E 47 F7 22 89 00 93 11) on port 8443.
2.  **Man-in-the-Middle:** With the private key, attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and decrypt traffic.
3.  **Initial Access Exploitation**: Attackers can access the web panel and set the administrator password during the vulnerable window after installation, if no user has yet logged in, due to the overly permissive firewall rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Knowledge of the Private Key:** The attacker needs to possess the static private key associated with the shared SSL certificate. This is trivially achievable since the software is freely available.
2.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target CloudPanel server to scan, perform MITM, or access the web panel.
3.  **Timing:** Attackers must exploit the blank superuser password vulnerability by accessing the web panel quickly after a fresh installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is especially concerning given CloudPanel's target audience of inexperienced users, who may not be aware of the security implications.
- The wide use of the same certificate means that any compromised key can be used to attack all instances.
- The vendor has not yet fixed the issue, and users are advised to manually generate and install their own SSL certificates.
- The issues were discovered and reported by Tod Beardsley of Rapid7.
