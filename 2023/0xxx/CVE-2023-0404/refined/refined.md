Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0404

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization check on several AJAX functions within the Events Made Easy plugin. This allows users with lower-level permissions (subscriber and above) to access functions intended for administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user capabilities before executing certain AJAX actions.
- **Insecure direct object reference:** Input parameters to several functions were not sanitized properly, and also failed capability checks.
- **SQL Injection:** Although the primary vulnerability is missing authorization, the code changes also address SQL injection by adding sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with subscriber-level access can invoke administrative functions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
- **Data Manipulation:** Due to improper input sanitization an attacker could potentially manipulate data and perform SQL injection attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **AJAX Requests:** The attack vector involves sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable plugin functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided changelog indicates that the developer implemented extra security checks on AJAX calls to prevent SQL injection, further indicating that lack of sanitization was also an issue.
- The Wordfence article mentions that the plugin is pending review from the WordPress repository and provides a link to the patched version on Github.
- The vulnerable functions seem to be related to listing and managing various plugin components such as events, form fields, locations, mailing lists, members, people, recurrences, tasks and templates.

**Summary of Changes**
The provided changeset shows that the patch primarily focuses on two types of modifications:
  1. Replacing `isset($_GET['param'])` with `!empty($_GET['param'])` to check if the parameter has a value to avoid PHP warnings.
  2. Adding `esc_sql()` and/or  `esc_sql(eme_sanitize_request(...))` to sanitize input parameters, particularly in AJAX functions.
  3. Implementing capability checks before running certain functions.

This update addresses both the authorization bypass issue and the potential for SQL injection.
