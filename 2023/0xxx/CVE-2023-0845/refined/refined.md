Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-0845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises when Consul server or client agents that host the xDS connection to an API or ingress gateway are configured with upstreams that reference a peering destination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability involves a crash of the Consul server or client agent.
- It is triggered by a specific configuration of upstreams in API or ingress gateways when they reference a peering destination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation leads to a crash of the Consul server and/or client agents.
- This crash can disrupt services relying on Consul and potentially lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker needs to have an ACL token with `service:write` permissions.
- There must be at least one running ingress or API gateway.
- The gateway must be configured to route traffic to an upstream service.
- The upstream service needs to reference a peering destination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attacker must be an authenticated user with `service:write` permissions within the Consul environment.
- The attacker must have the ability to modify service configurations.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator, just have the specified service:write permissions

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Consul and Consul Enterprise versions 1.14.0 up to 1.14.4.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Consul version 1.14.5 and later.
- The exploit involves manipulating the configuration of API or Ingress Gateways.
- This vulnerability is also mentioned in the Fedora updates as a security fix in `moby-engine`.
