The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0876.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Meta SEO plugin does not properly authorize several AJAX actions, allowing low-privilege users (specifically, subscribers) to modify certain data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Authorization: Low-privileged users can access and modify data through AJAX actions that should be restricted to higher-level users.
- Arbitrary Redirect: By manipulating data via the unauthorized AJAX actions, an attacker can force a redirect to an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks or to spread malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- AJAX Request Manipulation: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted AJAX request to the 'admin-ajax.php' endpoint, bypassing normal authorization checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the 'subscriber' role or higher.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request, which is achievable through Javascript within the browser.
