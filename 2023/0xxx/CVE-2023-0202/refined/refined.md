Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-0202:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0202

**Affected Product:** NVIDIA DGX A100 SBIOS

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the System Management Mode (SMM) APIs, specifically `GenericSio` and `LegacySmmSredir`. An attacker can exploit these APIs to modify arbitrary memory within SMRAM (System Management RAM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control/privilege management in SMM APIs, allowing modification of arbitrary memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Escalation of privileges
- Information disclosure

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required
- Exploitation requires high privileges
- Complex exploit conditions (AC:H)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs high privileges on the system.
- Attacker needs to be able to execute code in a context where they can invoke the vulnerable SMM APIs.
- The attacker needs to exploit a complex attack condition (AC:H)

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text gives more detail than the official CVE description placeholder, specifically mentioning the vulnerable APIs (`GenericSio` and `LegacySmmSredir`) and the ability to modify arbitrary memory in SMRAM.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in SBIOS version 1.18 for the NVIDIA DGX A100.
