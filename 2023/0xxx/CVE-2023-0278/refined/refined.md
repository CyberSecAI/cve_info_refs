- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GeoDirectory plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `geodir_delete_dummy_data` and a malicious payload in the `post_type` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or similar high-level privileges on the WordPress instance.
