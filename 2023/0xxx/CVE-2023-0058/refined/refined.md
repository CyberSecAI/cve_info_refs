The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Tiempo.com" WordPress plugin, version 0.1.2 and earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks CSRF protection when creating or editing shortcodes and fails to sanitize or escape user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin doesn't validate the origin of requests when creating/editing shortcodes allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an admin.
- Stored XSS: The plugin does not sanitize user input allowing an attacker to inject malicious javascript payloads, which will be stored and executed later when the shortcode is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users (including administrators) viewing the affected page. This can lead to various impacts such as:
- Account compromise by stealing cookies or session tokens.
- Website defacement.
- Redirection of users to malicious sites.
- Execution of malicious actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker exploits a CSRF vulnerability using a crafted HTML page.
- The victim (a logged-in administrator) is tricked into visiting this HTML page.
- The page automatically sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint of the plugin, which injects the malicious javascript code into the shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HTML page that they can trick a logged-in administrator into visiting.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the website or the WordPress administration panel.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint URL and parameters of the Tiempo.com plugin.
