## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Custom Post Type List Shortcode <= 1.4.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Note: First you need to add a Post Category with a following name: " onmouseover="alert(1)"
Note: Second you need to add a Post with the exploit category.
[cpt\_list post\_type='post' category='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
