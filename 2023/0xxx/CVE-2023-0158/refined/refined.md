- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A direct query for any existing directory under "/rrdp/", rather than an RRDP file, causes Krill to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Krill's built-in web server at the "/rrdp" endpoint does not properly handle directory queries, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Malicious remote parties can cause the publication server to crash, leading to a denial of service. While the repository content is not affected, the server's availability is impacted.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a direct query to any existing directory under the "/rrdp/" endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP queries to the "/rrdp" endpoint of the Krill publication server.
