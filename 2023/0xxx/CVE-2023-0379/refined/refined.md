- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page/post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the content of the page.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a crafted "Additional CSS class(es)" value to the "Spotlight Instagram Feed" Gutenberg block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with at least the contributor role can exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to create or edit content using the vulnerable Gutenberg block.
