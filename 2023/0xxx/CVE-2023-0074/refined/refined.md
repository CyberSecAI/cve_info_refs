- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with a payload in one of its attributes, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database. When the page is rendered, the script executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Users with the "contributor" role or higher, which can create posts or pages, are able to inject malicious scripts through crafted shortcode attributes.
