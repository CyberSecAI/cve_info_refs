{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mf_payment_status` shortcode in the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin does not properly validate user-supplied input when retrieving and displaying payment status information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to craft requests that will return sensitive information related to arbitrary form submissions, even if they did not make those submissions themselves.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure, Authorization Bypass",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers (with subscriber-level permissions or higher) can obtain sensitive information about arbitrary form submissions, including payment statuses. This could potentially lead to further attacks or unauthorized access to user data.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a request containing a specific `id` parameter, which is not properly validated when the `mf_payment_status` shortcode is processed. This allows them to retrieve and display information related to arbitrary form entries.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an account with subscriber-level permissions or higher on the vulnerable WordPress site. They can then make an authenticated request to the site that includes the malicious `id` parameter in a URL where the `mf_payment_status` shortcode is used."
