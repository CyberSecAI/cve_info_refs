- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape form settings, specifically within dropdown fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user views a form, leading to various potential impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker, with admin privileges, can inject the malicious payload into the `Text` field of a dropdown option within the form settings. When the form is previewed or embedded, the XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin's settings page and modify form fields.
