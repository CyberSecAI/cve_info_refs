Based on the provided content, the commit with hash `46c13a4b7f675b92d297df6dabb4441f13c7cd9c` in the `usememos/memos` repository introduces a change related to security by adding a "skipper" for secure middleware. This commit implements the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit is addressing the potential risk of applying security middleware to all requests, which can be unnecessary or cause issues with GET requests, which are typically used for retrieving data and should not be subjected to the same security checks as POST or PUT requests, for instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The initial configuration lacked a mechanism to skip security middleware for certain requests, potentially causing issues with the applications functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Without the "skipper," the application might not function as expected or GET request may be blocked due to the security middleware.

**Attack vectors:**
This change does not describe an attack vector directly. It is a preventative measure to avoid a possible denial of service due to excessive security enforcement, but it does not introduce any attack vector by itself.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
This change is related to securing the application and does not depend on the attacker's capabilities. The changes are part of a security fix rather than exploitation.

**Technical details:**

The commit includes changes to the following files:

*   **`server/common.go`**: Adds a `DefaultGetRequestSkipper` function that returns `true` if the request method is GET, effectively skipping security checks for GET requests.
*   **`server/resource.go`**: This file includes changes related to `Content-Type` header setting to `text/plain` for the resource.
*   **`server/server.go`**: Modifies the `middleware.Secure` configuration to use the newly added `DefaultGetRequestSkipper`.
*   **`server/version/version.go`** and **`server/version/version_test.go`**: updates the version to 0.10.0.
*   **`store/db/migration/prod/0.10/00__activity.sql` and `store/db/migration/prod/LATEST__SCHEMA.sql`**: Adds SQL statements for activity log.
*  **`web/src/components/EmbedMemoDialog.tsx`**: Contains a minor change for  typo in a comment.

In summary, this commit implements a security improvement by adding a skipper for `GET` requests to the secure middleware, preventing excessive security enforcement for these types of requests.
