- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them into a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which can lead to various impacts such as: redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of a user, defacing the website, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious javascript code in a shortcode attribute (e.g. `vca_tabs_color_theme`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with at least "Contributor" role to be able to create and embed malicious shortcodes in a post/page.
