The provided content relates to a commit in the Squidex repository that implements anti-forgery tokens for profile pages. This commit does not describe a vulnerability, but rather a security enhancement.

Specifically, the commit adds the `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]` attribute to the `AccountController`, `ProfileController`, and `SetupController` classes within the IdentityServer area of the application. This attribute ensures that all POST requests to these controllers include a valid anti-forgery token, protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Additionally, the commit modifies several Razor view files (`Consent.cshtml`, `Login.cshtml`, `Profile.cshtml`, `Setup.cshtml`) to include the `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` helper within their `<form>` elements. This helper generates and includes the anti-forgery token in the form.

Therefore, the provided content **does not relate to a vulnerability but rather to a security fix**, so it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2023-0642.
