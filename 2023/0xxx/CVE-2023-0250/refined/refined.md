  "mitigations": [
    "Update to Delta Electronics DIAScreen version 1.3.0 or later.",
    "Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems.",
    "Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.",
     "When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available."
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The advisory states that these vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely despite stating that remote code execution is possible, this may be due to misinterpretation in text. The CVSS vectors and description indicates that an attacker must have local access to the vulnerable software to trigger the vulnerability by having user interaction."
