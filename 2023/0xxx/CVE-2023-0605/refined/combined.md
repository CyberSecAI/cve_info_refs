## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Auto Rename Media On Upload < 1.1.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin's settings, and insert the following payload in any field: "OnMoUsEoVeR=prompt(1)//
2. Save the settings, and hover over the field.
3. A JavaScript alert will trigger.
"OnMoUsEoVeR=prompt(1)//
