      "additional_details": "The crash occurs when processing a malformed EAP packet, leading to a use-after-free condition. The vulnerability is triggered in the `dissect_x509af_SubjectName` function while processing the subject name of the certificate. The root cause is that memory is freed during the first pass, and then accessed again during the second pass. The vulnerability is present in versions of Wireshark from 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 and is fixed in version 4.0.3."
