Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-0200:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the OFBD (On-board Flash Device) component of the NVIDIA DGX-2 system. It involves an access beyond the end of a buffer. This occurs when a user with high privileges manipulates the heap in a specific way.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds access due to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of memory allocation and access by the OFBD component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution
- Escalation of privileges
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L)
- Requires high privileges (PR:H)
- Complex attack conditions (AC:H)
- System-level impact (S:C)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have high privileges on the DGX-2 system.
- Attacker must be able to precondition the heap in a specific way.
- Attacker must have local access to the system.
