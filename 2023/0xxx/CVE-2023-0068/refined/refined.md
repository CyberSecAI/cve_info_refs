- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities like session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, and more.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in its attributes and embedding it into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least the contributor role or a higher role in WordPress.
