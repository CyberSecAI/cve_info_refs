Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the "name" parameter of the "Add Customer" form within the Canteen Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. The application takes user-provided input in the `name` field without proper sanitization and renders it directly into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that is executed in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If successful, the attacker could potentially steal cookies, user session tokens or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker may modify user data or display phishing information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Form:** The attack vector is the `Add Customer` form, specifically the `name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the application:** The attacker must have access to the Canteen Management System's add customer functionality.
*   **Ability to manipulate input:** The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious code in the vulnerable field.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `name` field within the "Add Customer" form at `http://localhost/youthappam/add_customer.php`.
*   A sample payload `SRK_TEST"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is used to trigger the XSS. This payload injects a JavaScript `alert` box which confirms successful execution.
*  The application is not validating and sanitizing user inputs before displaying on webpage.
