- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with a payload in one of the attributes, and then embedding it in a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role to create/modify posts or pages.
