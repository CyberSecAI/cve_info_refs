- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `srcdoc` attribute within iframes in its custom HTML field type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into a form. This injected script can then be executed by any visitor to the form, or by administrators when previewing or editing the form. This could lead to malicious actions such as stealing cookies or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: A logged-in user with contributor-level privileges can create or edit a form, adding a custom HTML field with malicious JavaScript within the `srcdoc` attribute of an iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. They must be able to create or edit forms using the vulnerable plugin.
