## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Login Box <= 2.0.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Set “Greeting Text” option to:
<script>alert(1)</script>
Set “Enable the login box shortcode? [wplb]” option to:
Enabled
Shortcode:
[wplb]

### Affects Plugins
