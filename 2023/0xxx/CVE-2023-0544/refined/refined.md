- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users, such as admin, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected pages or functionalities. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors**: By setting the "Greeting Text" option to include malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) and enabling the login box shortcode. When the shortcode `[wplb]` is used on a page, the injected script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator-level access (or another high-privilege role) to modify the plugin settings.
