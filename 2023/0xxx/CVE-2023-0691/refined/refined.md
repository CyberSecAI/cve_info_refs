Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization and access control within the `mf_thankyou` shortcode of the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to adequately verify if a user is authorized to access submission data through the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The plugin discloses sensitive form submission data, specifically the submitter's last name and other data related to the submission, through the `mf_last_name` shortcode and other similar shortcodes, like `mf_transaction_id`, and `mf_payment_status`.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users with subscriber-level permissions or higher can access the submission data of other users. This is achieved through the manipulation of the `id` parameter in the shortcode, which is not being adequately validated.
*   **Insecure Data Access:** The plugin uses `$_GET` parameters to retrieve submission ID, and while sanitization using `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash($_GET['id']))` is in place it does not verify if the user has permission to view the submission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially view form submission data, such as names, transaction IDs, payment statuses, and potentially other information stored by the form.
*   **Privacy:** The vulnerability can compromise the privacy of users who have submitted forms using the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker exploits the vulnerability using the  `mf_last_name`, `mf_transaction_id`, `mf_payment_status`, or the `mf` shortcodes.
*   The attacker crafts a request with the `id` parameter pointing to a known submission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, with at least subscriber-level permissions on the WordPress site.
*   **Shortcode Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and usage of the `mf_last_name`,  `mf_transaction_id`, `mf_payment_status`, or the `mf` shortcodes and their vulnerable parameters.
*   **Access to WordPress Environment:** They require access to the WordPress environment where the vulnerable plugin is installed to use the shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also indicates that the issue was addressed in version 3.3.2 by:
    *   Adding the submission ID to the thank you page URL
    *   Improving security through nonce and authorization checking.
* The code diff of the `base/shortcode.php` file shows the implementation of additional checks with `transient_and_session_checker` function.
* The code diff of the `core/entries/action.php` file shows the implementation of session and transient token creation to ensure data access is legitimate.
