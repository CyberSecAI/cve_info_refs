- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions if an admin or other high priviledge user is targeted.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious shortcode with a JavaScript payload within the `class` attribute. The shortcode can be inserted into a page via a user with at least Contributor role. When a user visits this page, the javascript will be executed. The `pdf-reference` parameter must also be specified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a user account with at least Contributor role to insert the malicious shortcode on a page, and needs to find a valid pdf-reference to trigger the vulnerability.
