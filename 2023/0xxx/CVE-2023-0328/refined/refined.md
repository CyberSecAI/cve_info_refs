- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper privilege checks for several AJAX actions related to WPCode Library authentication. It only checks the nonce, not the user's capabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization, broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any authenticated user with the ability to edit posts (Contributor+) can update or delete the WPCode Library authentication key.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a specific POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the appropriate `action` parameter (`wpcode_library_store_auth` to update or `wpcode_library_delete_auth` to delete), a valid nonce, and other required parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor role (i.e., the ability to edit posts). They must also be able to extract the nonce from the page's source code.
