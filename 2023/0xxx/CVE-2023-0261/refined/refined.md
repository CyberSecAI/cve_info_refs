The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0261.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided PoC demonstrates that an attacker can cause a 5 second delay using the `SLEEP()` function, implying the possibility of blind SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `parse-media-shortcode` and a malicious shortcode in the body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least "subscriber" level access to the WordPress instance.
