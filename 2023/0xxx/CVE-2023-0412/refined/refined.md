**Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in the TIPC dissector.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The TIPC dissector is vulnerable to a crash. Specifically, the provided crash output shows a stack overflow occurring during the processing of a malformed packet due to recursive calls within the TIPC dissector related to the `dissect_tipc_int_prot_msg` function.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) of Wireshark.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered either by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by opening a crafted capture file containing such packets in Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject a specially crafted packet into a network that is being captured by Wireshark or convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file.
