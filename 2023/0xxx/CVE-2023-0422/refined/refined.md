- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the `publish_terms_text` setting before displaying it in the administration panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other administrators' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated administrator can inject the malicious payload via the `publish_terms_text` setting in the plugin's options.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site.
