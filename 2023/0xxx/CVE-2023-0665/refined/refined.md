Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) mount issuer endpoints of HashiCorp Vault. Specifically, certain unauthenticated endpoints did not properly authorize inbound requests. This flaw allowed for modification or deletion of specific metadata fields related to the issuers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks on specific PKI issuer endpoints. This allowed unauthorized users to access and modify issuer metadata.
- **Unauthenticated endpoints:** Certain endpoints (`<pki-mount>/issuer/:ref/{json,der,pem}`) did not require authentication, enabling unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service for a given PKI mount by modifying or deleting critical metadata fields such as `crl_distribution_points` and `oscp_server`.
- **Modification of Data:**  Attackers could modify authority information fields for existing issuers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable PKI mount issuer endpoints. Specifically,  `/<pki-mount>/issuer/:ref/{json,der,pem}`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Vault server where the vulnerable PKI mount is exposed.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require valid Vault credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability on affected endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability did *not* affect the private or public key material, trust chains or certificate issuance.
- The primary `<pki-mount>/issuer/:ref` endpoint is not affected and remains properly authenticated.
- The vulnerability was present in Vault versions 1.11.0 through 1.13.0, 1.12.4 and 1.11.8
- It is fixed in Vault versions 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9.
- NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable versions of Hashicorp Vault are also affected.
