- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin `Download Attachments` fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which will be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the page/post. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `container_class` shortcode attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least the "Contributor" role or higher in the WordPress installation to embed the shortcode into a page or post.
