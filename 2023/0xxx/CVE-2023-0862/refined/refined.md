The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-0862.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The web administration interface of NetModule routers executes OS commands using unsanitized user input.
- The web administration interface is also vulnerable to path traversal via unsanitized user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authenticated command injection via the `device_id` parameter in `gnssAutoAlign.php`, leading to arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges.
- Authenticated path traversal via the `scriptName` parameter in `sdkJobs.php`, leading to arbitrary file uploads and deletion, potentially enabling unconstrained remote command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Command injection:** An authenticated user can execute arbitrary OS commands with elevated privileges.
- **Path traversal:** An authenticated user can upload malicious PHP files to the web root directory, gaining unconstrained remote command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `/home/www-data/admin/gnssAutoAlign.php` with a malicious `device_id` parameter.
- Sending a crafted POST request to `/home/www-data/admin/include/sdkJobs.php` with a malicious `scriptName` parameter for file uploads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web administration interface of the affected NetModule routers.
