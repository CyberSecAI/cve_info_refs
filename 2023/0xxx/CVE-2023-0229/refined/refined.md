{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in github.com/openshift/apiserver-library-go allows low-privileged users to set the seccomp profile for pods they control to \"unconfined\".",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the ability of low-privileged users to bypass the intended seccomp profile restrictions, specifically the \"runtime/default\" profile set by the restricted-v2 Security Context Constraint (SCC). This bypass allows users to disable seccomp for pods they can create and modify.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By setting the seccomp profile to \"unconfined\", users can disable a security layer, potentially enabling them to bypass security restrictions and possibly escalate privileges. This vulnerability could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities (e.g., kernel privilege escalation flaws) to escape a container.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves low-privileged users exploiting the flaw to modify the seccomp profile of their pods.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the ability to create and/or modify pods within the affected OpenShift environment."
