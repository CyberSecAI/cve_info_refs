- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with a payload within attributes such as 'name' or 'subject' and embedding this shortcode in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Users with Contributor role or higher can embed shortcodes, allowing them to inject the malicious code.
