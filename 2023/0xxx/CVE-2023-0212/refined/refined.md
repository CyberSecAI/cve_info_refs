- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Recent Posts plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with JavaScript payload in the attributes (e.g., `[lptw_recentposts color_scheme='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`) and embedding this shortcode in a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role in WordPress or a higher level of access to publish content.
