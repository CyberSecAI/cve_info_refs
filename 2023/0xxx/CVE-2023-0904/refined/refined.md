Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0904

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `task-details.php` page of the Employee Task Management System. The application fails to properly sanitize and validate the `task_id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (`task_id` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive data stored in the database, including task details, user information, and other potentially confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data in the database.
- **System Control:** An attacker could potentially gain complete control of the database server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low privileges (employee user) could gain access to the full system by exploiting the vulnerability

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `task-details.php` page, manipulating the `task_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `task-details.php` page.
- An attacker needs to have an existing user account to view the task and the related page. The attacker does not need administrative privileges to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. A normal employee account that can access tasks can perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability, a sample request with a malicious SQL injection payload, and a sample response.
- The vulnerability can be fixed by updating the code in `task-details.php` to use parameterized queries instead of directly embedding the user-supplied `task_id` into the SQL query. The content also provides code to use as a fix.
