The provided content discusses a security vulnerability in Deye microinverters used in balcony power plants. This content is related to the specified CVE description, as it describes an exploitable security flaw.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a default, unchangeable Wi-Fi access point enabled on the microinverter with a well-known default password ("12345678"). This allows unauthorized access to the device's network interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure default configuration:** The microinverter ships with an active, unsecured Wi-Fi access point.
*   **Hardcoded default credentials:** The access point uses a hardcoded, easily guessable default password.
*  **Inability to disable AP or change password:** The device's interface does not allow disabling the access point or changing the default password.
*   **Lack of secure firmware update mechanism:**  The firmware update process is not directly available to the user, requiring an email request to the manufacturer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Access to home network:**  An attacker can use the microinverter's access point to access the home network it is connected to, potentially gaining access to other devices on the network.
*   **Exposure of WLAN credentials:** An attacker can use AT commands to extract the home network's Wi-Fi credentials.
*   **Device manipulation:** An attacker can use AT commands to change the device's operational mode (e.g., switching it to island mode), potentially causing damage to the microinverter if done while the device is connected to the grid.
*   **Loss of functionality:** Manipulating the device can lead to a total loss of functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Proximity-based attack:** The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the microinverter's access point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker must be within the Wi-Fi range of the microinverter's access point.
*   **Basic technical knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the default password of the access point and how to use AT commands.
