The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0812.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization and nonce checks for some POST requests, specifically within the `login_widget_save_options()` method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated data disclosure due to missing authorization checks on POST request handlers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive data by sending crafted POST requests.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` with specific parameters such as `option=mo_ldap_login_send_query`, `export_configuration_choice=yes`, `inner_form_email_id`, and `inner_form_query_id`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send POST requests to the WordPress instance.
