- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by inserting malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode attributes of the `wpf_optin_form` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress website to embed the shortcode and exploit the vulnerability.
