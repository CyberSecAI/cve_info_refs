## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Kanban Boards for WordPress < 2.5.21 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=kanban\_settings#tab-statuses.
2. Click the button "Add another status".
3. Name of the status should be: <script>alert(1)</script>, and save your settings.
4. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=kanban\_settings#tab-users, and check every user under Allowed Users.
5. As any user, go to https://example.com/?board\_id=1&kanban=board, and XSS will be triggered for any logged-in user.
