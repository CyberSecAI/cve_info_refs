The webservices in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection (PPS/POD) contain a vulnerability that allows for an anonymous user to execute remote code through 'eval injection'.  Exploitation requires network access to the webservices API, but such access is a non-standard configuration.  This affects all versions 8.20.0 and below.
