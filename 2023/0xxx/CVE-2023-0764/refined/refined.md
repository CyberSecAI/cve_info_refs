- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not perform proper sanitization of gallery information, specifically within the `gllr_image_text` and `gllr_image_alt_tag` parameters, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `gllr_image_text` or `gllr_image_alt_tag` parameters when creating or updating a gallery via a crafted HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Author level privileges on the WordPress site to be able to access the Gallery creation/editing interface.
