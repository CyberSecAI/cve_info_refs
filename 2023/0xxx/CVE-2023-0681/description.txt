Rapid7 InsightVM versions 6.6.178 and lower suffers from an open redirect vulnerability, whereby an attacker has the ability to redirect the user to a site of the attacker’s choice using the ‘page’ parameter of the ‘data/console/redirect’ component of the application. This issue was resolved in the February, 2023 release of version 6.6.179.
