Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `add_contestant.php` script of the Online Flight Booking Management System. Specifically, the script directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `fullname`, `sub_event_id`, and `contestant_ctr` POST parameters into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. By manipulating the input provided in the `fullname`, `sub_event_id`, or `contestant_ctr` fields, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, including user information, booking details, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:**  An attacker could also modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, SQL injection might lead to privilege escalation or further system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to cause a denial of service by crafting queries that cause the database server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `add_contestant.php` page.
*   An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `fullname`, `sub_event_id`, or `contestant_ctr` POST parameters when submitting the form on this page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web application, specifically targeting the `add_contestant.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `add_contestant` functionality of the Online Flight Booking Management System.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `if(isset($_POST['add_contestant']))` block.
*   The vulnerable SQL query is: `insert into contestants(fullname,subevent_id,contestant_ctr)values('$fullname','$sub_event_id','$contestant_ctr')`
*   The provided content indicates that, while error messages might be suppressed, time-based blind SQL injection attacks can still be carried out.
*   Burp Suite and sqlmap are mentioned as tools for vulnerability verification, and screenshots of successful sqlmap exploitation are included.
