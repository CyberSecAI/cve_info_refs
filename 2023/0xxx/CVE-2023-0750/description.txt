Yellobrik PEC-1864 implements authentication checks via javascript in the frontend interface.Â  When the device can be accessed over the network an attacker could bypass authentication.




This would allow an attacker to : 
- Change the password, resulting in a DOS of the users

- Change the streaming source, compromising the integrity of the stream

- Change the streaming destination, compromising the confidentiality of the stream








This issue affects Yellowbrik: PEC 1864. No patch has been issued by the manufacturer as this model was discontinued.
