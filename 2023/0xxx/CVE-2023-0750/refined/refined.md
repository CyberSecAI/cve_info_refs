- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authentication bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device's web UI uses HTTP only, which is unencrypted and insecure, and is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to the device and its configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the unencrypted web interface of the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device, which could be obtained if the device is connected to a public network.
