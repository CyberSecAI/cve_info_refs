## PEC 1864: Web UI for configuration Print

Modified on: Thu, 6 Apr, 2023 at 11:44 AM

---

PEC 1864 does not support RTMPS streaming protocol
WebUI uses HTTP only, i.e. is unencrypted and unsecure. Device should only be connected to secure/private networks.

**Security Note:** PEC-1864 is vulnerable to Authentication bypass (CVE-2023-0750). All versions are concerned, it is recommended to not have it connected to a public network.
