Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `search-request.php` script is vulnerable to reflected XSS. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before embedding it into the HTML response, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `searchdata` parameter before displaying it in the HTML output.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is injected through a URL parameter and is reflected back in the response, making it a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Account Takeover:** In scenarios where the attacker can steal session tokens or cookies, they can potentially take over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `search-request.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `searchdata` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and entice a user to visit it, or to directly send the crafted POST request if they can reach the `search-request.php` endpoint.
*   No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, since the vulnerable code is in the search functionality of the application which seems publicly available.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes a sample HTTP POST request with the malicious payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`.
*   The content also includes a screenshot and a video PoC demonstrating the successful execution of the XSS payload.
*   The vulnerable application appears to be called "Online Security Guard Hiring System".
