- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-submitted reviews.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into reviews. This code will be executed when other users view the affected page/post, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the submission of a review with a malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber privileges or higher. The attacker has to be able to submit reviews via the vulnerable plugin.
