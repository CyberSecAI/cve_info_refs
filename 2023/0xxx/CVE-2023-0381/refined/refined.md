Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0381:

**Root Cause:** The GigPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied shortcode attributes leads to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification
  - Potential complete compromise of the WordPress site depending on database privileges.
  - Denial of service by making the database unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's shortcodes: `gigpress_menu`, `gigpress_shows`, and `gigpress_related_shows`.
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious shortcode attribute.
- The shortcode is processed by `admin-ajax.php`, and the crafted SQL query is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject shortcode, for example in a post or page.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The proof of concept demonstrates that an attacker can inject sleep commands into the SQL queries via the shortcodes, causing a time delay, which confirms the successful injection.
- The `sort` attribute of all mentioned shortcodes is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is present in GigPress versions <= 2.3.28.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.7 (High).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Erwan LR (WPScan).
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89.
