- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Survey Maker â€“ Best WordPress Survey Plugin" plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts through survey answers. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the submissions page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Submitting crafted survey answers containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit surveys; no authentication or special privileges are required.
