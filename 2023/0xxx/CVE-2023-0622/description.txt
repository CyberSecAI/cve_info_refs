Cscape Envision RV version 4.60 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing project (i.e. HMI) files. The product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which could result in writes past the end of allocated data structures. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
