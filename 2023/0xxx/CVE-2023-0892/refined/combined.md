## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# BizLibrary <= 1.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Login as Admin.
2. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=bizlibrary and click on settings.
3. Insert the payload "><script>alert(1)</script> in the access key input field.
4. Hit save and XSS will be triggered.
