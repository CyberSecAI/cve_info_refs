The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0913.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize and validate user input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `sell_vehicle.php` page, which is then directly used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `sell_vehicle.php` page via the `id` parameter.
- Lack of input sanitization and validation.
- Usage of dynamic SQL queries without parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute unauthorized SQL queries on the database.
- Potential to access sensitive data, modify data, or take control of the entire system.
- Low-privileged users (employees) can exploit this to gain full system access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URL using the `id` parameter of the `sell_vehicle.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires a user with low privileges, such as an employee.
- The attacker needs to access the `sell_vehicle.php` page.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
