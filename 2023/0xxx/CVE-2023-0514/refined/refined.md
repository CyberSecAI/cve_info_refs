Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `member-database` plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input before displaying it back in the web page. Specifically, the `value` parameter within the request is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly cleanse or encode user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Output Without Escaping:** The plugin directly outputs unsanitized input into the HTML, resulting in the browser executing the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim if they are logged in
*   The vulnerability is exploitable against high-privilege users like administrators

**Attack Vector:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `value` parameter, and entices a logged-in administrator to open this URL.
*   The provided HTML PoC demonstrates this by using a form that automatically submits a request with the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the crafted URL. This often involves social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions `<= 1.0` of the `member-database` WordPress plugin.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), indicating a significant risk.
*   There is no known fix for this vulnerability, according to the provided information.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Shreya Pohekar.
