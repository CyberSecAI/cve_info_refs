### Content Verification:
1.  The provided content relates to CVE-2023-0693 based on the provided CVE ID and description in the Wordfence article.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the Metform plugin's implementation of the 'mf\_transaction\_id' shortcode, which directly retrieves and displays transaction IDs from post meta data without proper authorization checks.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities
-   **Information Disclosure**: The 'mf\_transaction\_id' shortcode reveals sensitive transaction IDs.
-   **Authorization Bypass**: Subscriber-level users can access transaction IDs of arbitrary form submissions with payments, bypassing intended access restrictions.
-  **Lack of Input Validation**: The shortcode directly uses the `id` parameter from the `$_GET` request without verifying if the user has access to the corresponding post.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to access transaction IDs of form submissions that included payment and potentially obtain sensitive financial information or other private data.

### Attack vectors
-   The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request including an `id` parameter, when the shortcode is used on a page.
-   The 'mf\_transaction\_id' shortcode is vulnerable.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
-   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher on the WordPress website.
-   The attacker must be able to insert a shortcode into a page.
