- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with a payload within the attributes (e.g. `[naver-map y='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']`), an attacker can inject malicious javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site in order to publish pages or posts that embed the malicious shortcode.
