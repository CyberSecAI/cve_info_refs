- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries. Specifically, the `password` parameter in the login form is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication, retrieve database contents, modify or delete records, and potentially execute OS commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the login page (`/php-scrm/login.php`) with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `password` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target application and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter.
