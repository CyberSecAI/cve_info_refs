Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `real.Kit` WordPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of sanitization of shortcode attributes.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected page or post. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A user with at least Contributor role can craft a malicious shortcode, embed it into a page or post, and when that page/post is viewed, the injected script is executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role within the WordPress installation. They do not need to be an administrator.

The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted shortcode:
`[modal open='1' class='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']XSS[/modal]`
This shortcode includes the `onmouseover` attribute which executes javascript code.
