Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0814

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on sensitive user meta values that could be accessed via the `[user_meta]` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The plugin allowed retrieval of sensitive user meta data such as `user_pass` and `user_activation_key` through the `[user_meta]` shortcode.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** There was no proper validation of the 'key' attribute in the `[user_meta]` shortcode, allowing retrieval of sensitive data by specifying corresponding keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers could retrieve sensitive user meta data (like password reset keys), potentially gaining access to high-privileged accounts. This could lead to full compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive user information was exposed to unauthorized actors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Exploitation:** The attack vector is the `[user_meta]` shortcode. An attacker can craft a shortcode using a `key` attribute to access sensitive user metadata.
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible via the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated users on the WordPress site, with subscriber-level permissions or higher.
- **Shortcode Access:** The 'Usermeta shortcode' functionality needs to be enabled.
- **Knowledge of Meta Keys:** The attacker needs to know the name of the sensitive meta keys (`user_pass`, `user_activation_key`, etc.)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.9.1 of the Profile Builder plugin.
- The fix includes restricting the retrieval of 'user_pass' and 'user_activation_key' meta keys through the `[user_meta]` shortcode and including `login` parameter when generating the password reset link.
