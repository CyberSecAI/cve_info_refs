Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-0985:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key". The vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to change the password of any user within the same account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Authorization Bypass (CWE-639)
- User-controlled key allows for unauthorized modification of user passwords

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the password of any user, including the admin user, within the same account.
- This allows for full compromise of the account, leading to complete takeover by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network based attack vector
- The attacker must be authenticated with low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with low privileges on the affected system.

**Affected Products:**
- MB Connect Line's mbCONNECT24 and mymbCONNECT24
- Helmholz' myREX24 and myREX24.virtual
- Affected versions are all versions <= 2.13.3

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated with a severity of 8.8 using CVSS v3.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- Mitigation is possible if MFA is enabled on the admin user, as the password can still be changed, but the attacker would still need the MFA code to log in.
- The recommended solution is to update to version 2.13.4 or later.
