Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Path Traversal issue (CWE-22) in the TEL-STER TelWin SCADA WebInterface.
- External input is used to construct file paths without properly neutralizing special elements like "..", allowing traversal outside of the intended directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths, enabling an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the TelWin SCADA WebInterface is running.
- This could lead to the disclosure of:
    - Configuration files
    - Application source code
    - Sensitive system files
    - Other confidential information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, requiring network access to the vulnerable application.
- Exploitation is achieved by sending a specially crafted GET request to the server.
- No authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target system running the vulnerable TelWin SCADA WebInterface.
- No special privileges or access credentials are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of TelWin SCADA WebInterface: versions 3.2 to 6.1, 7.0 to 7.1, 8.0, and 9.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin Dudek of CERT.PL.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating a high severity.
- There are no known public exploits.
- Mitigation involves updating the WebInterface module to versions 6.2, 7.2, 8.1, 9.1, or 10.0. TEL-STER recommends updating the TelWin SCADA software to a supported version.
- A temporary mitigation can be applied by modifying the web.config file to block ".." sequences in URLs.
- CISA recommends minimizing network exposure, locating control systems behind firewalls, and using secure remote access methods such as VPNs.
