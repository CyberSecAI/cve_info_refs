- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows devices. This vulnerability is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a local file deletion vulnerability that arises from a race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete system files from the endpoint with elevated privileges. This can lead to system instability, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. The attacker must have local access to the Windows device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges on the local Windows device to exploit this vulnerability and trigger the race condition.
