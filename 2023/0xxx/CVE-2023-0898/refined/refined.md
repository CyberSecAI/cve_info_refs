- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability, where it loads DLL files from its directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427). The application loads DLL files from its directory, which allows an attacker to place malicious DLLs in the same directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to upload malicious files and achieve code execution on the system where the software is installed.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker with local access to the system can place malicious DLL files in the application's directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software (General Electric MiCOM S1 Agile) is installed. They also require high privileges to write to the directory where the application is installed. The user also needs to execute the program after the malicious DLL is in place.
