Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Flexible Captcha plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before displaying them on a page/post.

This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites or other forms of malicious code execution, depending on what the malicious script is designed to do.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By embedding a crafted shortcode into a page or post, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the page.
