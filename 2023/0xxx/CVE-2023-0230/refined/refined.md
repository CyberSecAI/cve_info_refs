- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them in a page/post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the "Additional CSS class(es)" setting of the CTA block is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page or post. This could allow the attacker to perform various actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the vulnerable "Additional CSS class(es)" setting within the CTA block to inject malicious JavaScript code. This payload is stored and triggered when the post is viewed/previewed and the mouse hovers over the affected block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges. They also need the 'CTA Expansion' setting enabled in the plugin and at least one CTA published.
