## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# VK All in One Expansion Unit < 9.86.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Setup: The CTA Expansion (wp-admin/admin.php?page=vkExUnit\_setting\_page) must be enabled, and at least one CTA (/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=cta) must be published.
As a contributor, add a CTA block in a post, select a published CTA and put the following payload in the "Additional CSS class(es)" setting of the block: " onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;"
The XSS will be triggered when previewing/viewing the post and moving the mouse over the red block.
Note: If random is selected and there is no CTA published, the post won't be able to be saved, and will rather crash
