## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Time Sheets < 1.29.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Login as Admin.
2. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=time\_sheets\_settings
3. Insert the payload `'><script>alert(1)</script>` in the field `Email address to email when a project is over on hours:`
4. Click on save changes and XSS payload will be stored and triggered.
