- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The go-getter library is vulnerable to denial of service via a maliciously crafted compressed archive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The library does not properly handle malicious compressed archives, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a malicious URL input containing a crafted compressed archive to the go-getter library.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have the ability to provide malicious URL inputs to the go-getter library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to influence the URL input to the go-getter library, using a decompressor to trigger the vulnerability. The impact of the vulnerability depends on the usage of go-getter, with server-side usage posing a greater risk than client-side usage.
