Hi !

We've been working on various enhancements to ubi\_reader at <https://github.com/IoT-Inspector/ubi_reader/>, one of them is a security fix for potential path traversals.

ubireader\_extract\_files could lead to path traversal when run against specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside of the extraction directory (provided the process has write access to that file or directory).

This is due to the fact that a node name (`dent_node.name`) is considered trusted and joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. `../../tmp/outside.txt`), we can make ubi\_reader write outside of the extraction directory.

This is problematic, even more so if end users run ubi\_reader with elevated privileges in order have the ability to create block devices.

Let me know if you need malicious UBIFS samples for your tests.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi QKaiser,  Thank you for pointing this out, I was able to modify an image to demonstrate this, good catch, never thought of it. I am having a problem with the patch though. In is\_safe\_path, matchpath is an absolute path, while basedir is a relative path causing os.path.commonpath() to error out with "Can't mix absolute and relative paths".  I assume the fix here is giving basedir the same treatment as path.  Also just to note, there was an update recently to version 0.8.0 that fixed a major flaw, where in certain files would not be extracted accurately. Should not conflict with what you have done.  -Jason |

| Hi QKaiser,  It worked good, but I had to make one little fix. dent\_path is set after is\_safe\_path() is called, so that if it fails, an error is thrown "extract\_files Error: local variable 'dent\_path' referenced before assignment" when trying to print the error.  I just had to put dent\_path = ... before is\_safe\_path() like  ```     dent_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(path, dent_node.name))      if not is_safe_path(path, dent_node.name):         log(extract_dents, 'path traversal attempt: %s, discarding' % (dent_path))         return  ```  If you could make that change I can merge your changes, thanks.  -Jason |

| Hi QKaiser, Passes all my tests now, thank you for that.  I'm just wondering now, if this should be an error, which would show regardless of log settings. If someone went through the trouble to make an image like this, there could be more to it, and this would be a first line alert that more precaution could be needed with the contents. Something like  ```        error(extract_dents, 'Warn', 'Path traversal attempt: %s, discarding' % (dent_node.name))  ```  This would only print a warning, unless error action is set to exit. If you don't want to mess with it, I can fix this in the next commit, I found a similar issue near by I'll need to fix anyhow.  Thank you for this bug fix. -Jason |

| Hi Jason,  We have an upcoming publication about similar vulnerabilities affecting different extractors in jefferson, yaffshiv, and binwalk. We requested CVEs for each of these vulnerability so that users are aware they should upgrade to the latest version (through dependabot for example).  The one that was fixed in ubi-reader is [CVE-2023-0591](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp2x-3mc3-3cj4 "CVE-2023-0591"), you're credited as remediation reviewer :) |

## Introduction

Before we dive into the technical details, we want to raise our hats to the teams behind [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/), [ubi\_reader](https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader), [jefferson](https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson), and [yaffshiv](https://github.com/devttys0/yaffshiv) and express our respect and admiration for the work they put into it over the years and all their contributions towards the security community. Without them, and many other great projects, security analysis of IoT devices would not be where it is today. With the fading maintenance of binwalk, we too were inspired to contribute to the security community and open source our internal extraction framework [unblob](https://www.unblob.org). Our objective with this blog is to summarize some of the pitfalls when dealing with untrusted data and to raise awareness about path traversal security issues and the impact they may have.

With that being out of the way, let's dive in !

As detailed in my Black Alps talk, we audited multiple third-party extractors code base that unblob relies on over the summer of 2022 and identified multiple issues ranging from logic bugs leading to extraction failures to path traversals. In the process, I learned a lot about [the many different ways you can end up with a path traversal in Python](#bonus).

Around October 2022, I had the realization that if all those third-party dependencies are suffering from some variation of these insecure coding patterns, binwalk may be too. So, I started looking and soon enough found a path traversal within the PFS filesystem extractor. I then found a way to gain remote code execution by abusing binwalk's plugin system over lunch at [hardwear.io](https://hardwear.io/) with [MÃ¼cahid](https://twitter.com/muc0ze).

As explained in the [pull request](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617) I sent on October 26th, I took the liberty to report [it] in the open since [#556](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/556) was fixed that way and I did not find any security/coordinated disclosure policy or contact info. At the time of publication, the vulnerability has yet to be patched.

## Summary

A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 (inclusive). This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of binwalk. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open the malicious file with binwalk using extract mode (`-e` option).

## The bug

PFS is an obscure filesystem format found in some embedded devices. The only public documentation comes from a tool named [pfstool](https://lekensteyn.nl/files/pfs/pfs.txt) written by Peter Lekensteyn.

A PFS extractor plugin was merged into binwalk in 2017 with commit [d023454](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/commit/d023454), and a path traversal mitigation attempt was introduced with commit [58d1d92](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/commit/58d1d92) on the same day. This commit introduced the following change:

```
     def extractor(self, fname):
         fname = os.path.abspath(fname)
+        out_dir = binwalk.core.common.unique_file_name(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(fname), "pfs-root"))
+
         try:
             with PFS(fname) as fs:
                 # The end of PFS meta data is the start of the actual data
-                data = open(fname, 'rb')
+                data = binwalk.core.common.BlockFile(fname, 'rb')
                 data.seek(fs.get_end_of_meta_data())
                 for entry in fs.entries():
-                    self._create_dir_from_fname(entry.fname)
-                    outfile = open(entry.fname, 'wb')
-                    outfile.write(data.read(entry.fsize))
-                    outfile.close()
+                    outfile_path = os.path.join(out_dir, entry.fname)
+                    if not outfile_path.startswith(out_dir): # this branch will never be taken
+                        binwalk.core.common.warning("Unpfs extractor detected directory traversal attempt for file: '%s'. Refusing to extract." % outfile_path)
+                    else:
+                        self._create_dir_from_fname(outfile_path)
+                        outfile = binwalk.core.common.BlockFile(outfile_path, 'wb')
+                        outfile.write(data.read(entry.fsize))
+                        outfile.close()
                 data.close()
         except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
             raise e

```

The issue lies in the fact that `os.path.join` one line 16 does not fully resolve a path. Therefore, the condition on line 17 will never be true. Here's an example of that behavior:

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd")
'/tmp/../etc/passwd'
>>> os.path.abspath(os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd"))
'/etc/passwd'
```

By crafting a valid PFS filesystem with filenames containing the `../` traversal sequence, we can force binwalk to write files **outside** of the extraction directory.

## Our fix

Our fix simply introduce a call to `os.path.abspath` on line 8 so that the built path is fully resolved.

## Exploitation Strategy

There are plenty of ways to get remote command execution from a path traversal (e.g., by overwriting `.ssh/authorized_keys` to obtain password-less SSH access, overwrite `~/.bashrc` to execute arbitrary commands on the next login), but I wanted something that was environment agnostic and relied on what's already there. **Enter binwalk plugins**.

Since the early days of binwalk, users have the ability to define their own plugins using binwalk's API. As [indicated in the documentation](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/Creating-Custom-Plugins#plugin-activation):

"*Activating a plugin is as simple as dropping it in binwalk's plugin directory $HOME/.config/binwalk/plugins/. The plugin will then be loaded on all subsequent binwalk scans.*"

So, if we exploit the path traversal to write a valid plugin at that location, binwalk will immediately pick it up and execute it **while it's still scanning the malicious file**. On top of that, the PFS extractor will take care of creating all required directories if they do not exist, so we don't need to expect anything from the system we're running on.

This is the plugin I ended up writing. The plugin executes two times since it does not define an explicit `MODULE` attribute that defines its purpose (e.g., signature scan, entropy calculation, compression stream identification). I take advantage of that behavior to make it clean up after itself.

```
import binwalk.core.plugin
import os
import shutil

class MaliciousExtractor(binwalk.core.plugin.Plugin):
    """
    Malicious binwalk plugin
    """

    def init(self):
        if not os.path.exists("/tmp/.binwalk"):
            os.system("id")
            with open("/tmp/.binwalk", "w") as f:
                f.write("1")
        else:
            os.remove("/tmp/.binwalk")
            os.remove(os.path.abspath(__file__))
            shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "__pycache__"))

```

Crafting malicious PFS file is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Demo

Here's a video demo of the exploit:

## Future Work

The ["D-Link RomFS" plugin](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/blob/master/src/binwalk/plugins/dlromfsextract.py) is probably affected by a similar vulnerability but the format, which is actually eCOS RomFS, is not parsed properly (see this [PR](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/456) for a fix). I did not want to load two opposing format constructs in my brain just to come up with a proof-of-concept. As a former colleague of mine would have said: CBA.

## Key Takeaways

As security industry, every now and then, we need to look in the mirror and also validate the security of our own technology stack. This especially becomes critical in forensic analysis and reverse engineering where we are commonly faced with untrusted, potentially malicious files.

While the path traversals described in this article have the potential to void any reverse engineering efforts and to tamper with evidence collected, they also demonstrate the importance of sandboxing analysis environments to limit the impact of such vulnerabilities. Especially with the rise of automated extraction and analysis tools relying on tools like binwalk (e.g., FACT, ofrak, EMBA), it's important for developers and users of those solution to be aware of the risks.

## Timeline

**2022-10**-**24** - Attempt to get in touch with Refirm Labs but no security policies and domains are down.

**2022-10-26** â Decided to send a pull request with the fix (<https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617>) so that it could be immediately integrated.

**2022-11-17** â Live demo of the exploit during our talk at Black Alps.

**2023-01-24** â Since the CPE of the latest binwalk vulnerability states `microsoft:binwalk` and that Refirm Labs got [acquired in 2021](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/06/02/microsoft-acquires-refirm-labs-to-enhance-iot-security/), we reported it to MSRC. Turns out MSRC does not consider it a Microsoft product and the CPE was chosen this way by [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/).

**2023-01-25** â Since we're a CNA and we're not seeing any movement on the repository, we take the decision to create a dedicated CVE so that users are aware of this.

**2023-01-31** â ONEKEY releases its advisory

### ubi\_reader - **no path traversal verification at all**

| **Affected vendor & product** | jrspruitt:ubi\_reader |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | < 0.8.5 |
| **Fixed version** | 0.8.5 |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0591](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0591) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

As seen in [ubi\_reader](https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader/pull/57/files), the code does not attempt to protect against traversal.

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    extraction_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
```

### **jefferson - no path traversal verification at all**

| **Affected vendor & product** | sviehb:jefferson |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | < 0.4.1 |
| **Fixed version** | 0.4.1 |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0592](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0592) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

Similar but not the same signature, observed in [Jefferson](https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson/pull/36/files).

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    extraction_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), extraction_dir, path)
```

### **yaffshiv - misunderstanding os.path.join's argument precedence**

| **Affected vendor & product** | devttys0:yaffshiv |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | <= 0.1 |
| **Fixed version** | None |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0593](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0592) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

The code makes the assumption that `filename` does not start with a forward slash. Observed in [yaffshiv](https://github.com/devttys0/yaffshiv/pull/3/files).

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    file_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
    if b'..' in file_path:
        raise Exception("Path traversal attempt, aborting.")
```

The second argument of `os.path.join` always takes precedence if both of them starts with a forward slash.

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "home/traversal")
'/tmp/home/traversal'
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "/home/traversal")
'/home/traversal'
```

### **binwalk's unpfs - **misunderstanding os.path.join's lack of resolution****

The code makes the assumption that `os.path.join` returns an absolute path, which it doesn't.

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    outfile_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
    if not outfile_path.startswith(extraction_dir ): # this condition will never be True
        raise Exception("Path traversal attempt, aborting.")
```

This is what it looks like:

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd")
'/tmp/../etc/passwd'
>>> os.path.abspath(os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd"))
'/etc/passwd'
```

## Package

pip

ubi-reader
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.8.5

## Patched versions

0.8.5

## Description

ubireader\_extract\_files is vulnerable to path traversal when run against specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside of the extraction directory (provided the process has write access to that file or directory). This is due to the fact that a node name (dent\_node.name) is considered trusted and joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt), it's possible to force ubi\_reader to write outside of the extraction directory. This issue affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5.

This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

### @qkaiser **[qkaiser](/qkaiser)** commented [May 19, 2022](#issue-1241381507)

Hi !

We've been working on various enhancements to ubi\_reader at <https://github.com/IoT-Inspector/ubi_reader/>, one of them is a security fix for potential path traversals.

ubireader\_extract\_files could lead to path traversal when run against specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside of the extraction directory (provided the process has write access to that file or directory).

This is due to the fact that a node name (`dent_node.name`) is considered trusted and joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. `../../tmp/outside.txt`), we can make ubi\_reader write outside of the extraction directory.

This is problematic, even more so if end users run ubi\_reader with elevated privileges in order have the ability to create block devices.

Let me know if you need malicious UBIFS samples for your tests.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi QKaiser,  Thank you for pointing this out, I was able to modify an image to demonstrate this, good catch, never thought of it. I am having a problem with the patch though. In is\_safe\_path, matchpath is an absolute path, while basedir is a relative path causing os.path.commonpath() to error out with "Can't mix absolute and relative paths".  I assume the fix here is giving basedir the same treatment as path.  Also just to note, there was an update recently to version 0.8.0 that fixed a major flaw, where in certain files would not be extracted accurately. Should not conflict with what you have done.  -Jason |

| I'll look into doing proper normalization prior to checking path so there is no mixup error being raised. Will keep you posted. |

| Hi QKaiser,  It worked good, but I had to make one little fix. dent\_path is set after is\_safe\_path() is called, so that if it fails, an error is thrown "extract\_files Error: local variable 'dent\_path' referenced before assignment" when trying to print the error.  I just had to put dent\_path = ... before is\_safe\_path() like  ```     dent_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(path, dent_node.name))      if not is_safe_path(path, dent_node.name):         log(extract_dents, 'path traversal attempt: %s, discarding' % (dent_path))         return  ```  If you could make that change I can merge your changes, thanks.  -Jason |

| Hi QKaiser, Passes all my tests now, thank you for that.  I'm just wondering now, if this should be an error, which would show regardless of log settings. If someone went through the trouble to make an image like this, there could be more to it, and this would be a first line alert that more precaution could be needed with the contents. Something like  ```        error(extract_dents, 'Warn', 'Path traversal attempt: %s, discarding' % (dent_node.name))  ```  This would only print a warning, unless error action is set to exit. If you don't want to mess with it, I can fix this in the next commit, I found a similar issue near by I'll need to fix anyhow.  Thank you for this bug fix. -Jason |

| Hi Jason,  We have an upcoming publication about similar vulnerabilities affecting different extractors in jefferson, yaffshiv, and binwalk. We requested CVEs for each of these vulnerability so that users are aware they should upgrade to the latest version (through dependabot for example).  The one that was fixed in ubi-reader is [CVE-2023-0591](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp2x-3mc3-3cj4 "CVE-2023-0591"), you're credited as remediation reviewer :) |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

## Introduction

Before we dive into the technical details, we want to raise our hats to the teams behind [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/), [ubi\_reader](https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader), [jefferson](https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson), and [yaffshiv](https://github.com/devttys0/yaffshiv) and express our respect and admiration for the work they put into it over the years and all their contributions towards the security community. Without them, and many other great projects, security analysis of IoT devices would not be where it is today. With the fading maintenance of binwalk, we too were inspired to contribute to the security community and open source our internal extraction framework [unblob](https://www.unblob.org). Our objective with this blog is to summarize some of the pitfalls when dealing with untrusted data and to raise awareness about path traversal security issues and the impact they may have.

With that being out of the way, let's dive in !

As detailed in my Black Alps talk, we audited multiple third-party extractors code base that unblob relies on over the summer of 2022 and identified multiple issues ranging from logic bugs leading to extraction failures to path traversals. In the process, I learned a lot about [the many different ways you can end up with a path traversal in Python](#bonus).

Around October 2022, I had the realization that if all those third-party dependencies are suffering from some variation of these insecure coding patterns, binwalk may be too. So, I started looking and soon enough found a path traversal within the PFS filesystem extractor. I then found a way to gain remote code execution by abusing binwalk's plugin system over lunch at [hardwear.io](https://hardwear.io/) with [MÃ¼cahid](https://twitter.com/muc0ze).

As explained in the [pull request](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617) I sent on October 26th, I took the liberty to report [it] in the open since [#556](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/556) was fixed that way and I did not find any security/coordinated disclosure policy or contact info. At the time of publication, the vulnerability has yet to be patched.

## Summary

A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 (inclusive). This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of binwalk. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open the malicious file with binwalk using extract mode (`-e` option).

## The bug

PFS is an obscure filesystem format found in some embedded devices. The only public documentation comes from a tool named [pfstool](https://lekensteyn.nl/files/pfs/pfs.txt) written by Peter Lekensteyn.

A PFS extractor plugin was merged into binwalk in 2017 with commit [d023454](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/commit/d023454), and a path traversal mitigation attempt was introduced with commit [58d1d92](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/commit/58d1d92) on the same day. This commit introduced the following change:

```
     def extractor(self, fname):
         fname = os.path.abspath(fname)
+        out_dir = binwalk.core.common.unique_file_name(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(fname), "pfs-root"))
+
         try:
             with PFS(fname) as fs:
                 # The end of PFS meta data is the start of the actual data
-                data = open(fname, 'rb')
+                data = binwalk.core.common.BlockFile(fname, 'rb')
                 data.seek(fs.get_end_of_meta_data())
                 for entry in fs.entries():
-                    self._create_dir_from_fname(entry.fname)
-                    outfile = open(entry.fname, 'wb')
-                    outfile.write(data.read(entry.fsize))
-                    outfile.close()
+                    outfile_path = os.path.join(out_dir, entry.fname)
+                    if not outfile_path.startswith(out_dir): # this branch will never be taken
+                        binwalk.core.common.warning("Unpfs extractor detected directory traversal attempt for file: '%s'. Refusing to extract." % outfile_path)
+                    else:
+                        self._create_dir_from_fname(outfile_path)
+                        outfile = binwalk.core.common.BlockFile(outfile_path, 'wb')
+                        outfile.write(data.read(entry.fsize))
+                        outfile.close()
                 data.close()
         except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
             raise e

```

The issue lies in the fact that `os.path.join` one line 16 does not fully resolve a path. Therefore, the condition on line 17 will never be true. Here's an example of that behavior:

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd")
'/tmp/../etc/passwd'
>>> os.path.abspath(os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd"))
'/etc/passwd'
```

By crafting a valid PFS filesystem with filenames containing the `../` traversal sequence, we can force binwalk to write files **outside** of the extraction directory.

## Our fix

Our fix simply introduce a call to `os.path.abspath` on line 8 so that the built path is fully resolved.

## Exploitation Strategy

There are plenty of ways to get remote command execution from a path traversal (e.g., by overwriting `.ssh/authorized_keys` to obtain password-less SSH access, overwrite `~/.bashrc` to execute arbitrary commands on the next login), but I wanted something that was environment agnostic and relied on what's already there. **Enter binwalk plugins**.

Since the early days of binwalk, users have the ability to define their own plugins using binwalk's API. As [indicated in the documentation](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/Creating-Custom-Plugins#plugin-activation):

"*Activating a plugin is as simple as dropping it in binwalk's plugin directory $HOME/.config/binwalk/plugins/. The plugin will then be loaded on all subsequent binwalk scans.*"

So, if we exploit the path traversal to write a valid plugin at that location, binwalk will immediately pick it up and execute it **while it's still scanning the malicious file**. On top of that, the PFS extractor will take care of creating all required directories if they do not exist, so we don't need to expect anything from the system we're running on.

This is the plugin I ended up writing. The plugin executes two times since it does not define an explicit `MODULE` attribute that defines its purpose (e.g., signature scan, entropy calculation, compression stream identification). I take advantage of that behavior to make it clean up after itself.

```
import binwalk.core.plugin
import os
import shutil

class MaliciousExtractor(binwalk.core.plugin.Plugin):
    """
    Malicious binwalk plugin
    """

    def init(self):
        if not os.path.exists("/tmp/.binwalk"):
            os.system("id")
            with open("/tmp/.binwalk", "w") as f:
                f.write("1")
        else:
            os.remove("/tmp/.binwalk")
            os.remove(os.path.abspath(__file__))
            shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "__pycache__"))

```

Crafting malicious PFS file is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Demo

Here's a video demo of the exploit:

## Future Work

The ["D-Link RomFS" plugin](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/blob/master/src/binwalk/plugins/dlromfsextract.py) is probably affected by a similar vulnerability but the format, which is actually eCOS RomFS, is not parsed properly (see this [PR](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/456) for a fix). I did not want to load two opposing format constructs in my brain just to come up with a proof-of-concept. As a former colleague of mine would have said: CBA.

## Key Takeaways

As security industry, every now and then, we need to look in the mirror and also validate the security of our own technology stack. This especially becomes critical in forensic analysis and reverse engineering where we are commonly faced with untrusted, potentially malicious files.

While the path traversals described in this article have the potential to void any reverse engineering efforts and to tamper with evidence collected, they also demonstrate the importance of sandboxing analysis environments to limit the impact of such vulnerabilities. Especially with the rise of automated extraction and analysis tools relying on tools like binwalk (e.g., FACT, ofrak, EMBA), it's important for developers and users of those solution to be aware of the risks.

## Timeline

**2022-10**-**24** - Attempt to get in touch with Refirm Labs but no security policies and domains are down.

**2022-10-26** â Decided to send a pull request with the fix (<https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617>) so that it could be immediately integrated.

**2022-11-17** â Live demo of the exploit during our talk at Black Alps.

**2023-01-24** â Since the CPE of the latest binwalk vulnerability states `microsoft:binwalk` and that Refirm Labs got [acquired in 2021](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/06/02/microsoft-acquires-refirm-labs-to-enhance-iot-security/), we reported it to MSRC. Turns out MSRC does not consider it a Microsoft product and the CPE was chosen this way by [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/).

**2023-01-25** â Since we're a CNA and we're not seeing any movement on the repository, we take the decision to create a dedicated CVE so that users are aware of this.

**2023-01-31** â ONEKEY releases its advisory

## Python Path Traversal Code Patterns

All of the code examples provided below are illustrations of the insecure code patterns observed in the affected projects. You can click on the link provided in each description to open the pull request highlighting the actual code.

### ubi\_reader - **no path traversal verification at all**

| **Affected vendor & product** | jrspruitt:ubi\_reader |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | < 0.8.5 |
| **Fixed version** | 0.8.5 |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0591](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0591) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

As seen in [ubi\_reader](https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader/pull/57/files), the code does not attempt to protect against traversal.

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    extraction_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
```

### **jefferson - no path traversal verification at all**

| **Affected vendor & product** | sviehb:jefferson |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | < 0.4.1 |
| **Fixed version** | 0.4.1 |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0592](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0592) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

Similar but not the same signature, observed in [Jefferson](https://github.com/sviehb/jefferson/pull/36/files).

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    extraction_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), extraction_dir, path)
```

### **yaffshiv - misunderstanding os.path.join's argument precedence**

| **Affected vendor & product** | devttys0:yaffshiv |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerable version** | <= 0.1 |
| **Fixed version** | None |
| **CVE IDs** | [CVE-2023-0593](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0592) |
| **Impact (CVSS)** | 5.5 (medium) [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) |
| **Credit** | Q. Kaiser, ONEKEY Research Lab |

The code makes the assumption that `filename` does not start with a forward slash. Observed in [yaffshiv](https://github.com/devttys0/yaffshiv/pull/3/files).

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    file_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
    if b'..' in file_path:
        raise Exception("Path traversal attempt, aborting.")
```

The second argument of `os.path.join` always takes precedence if both of them starts with a forward slash.

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "home/traversal")
'/tmp/home/traversal'
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "/home/traversal")
'/home/traversal'
```

### **binwalk's unpfs - **misunderstanding os.path.join's lack of resolution****

The code makes the assumption that `os.path.join` returns an absolute path, which it doesn't.

```
import os
extraction_dir = "/tmp"

for filename in filenames:
    outfile_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, filename)
    if not outfile_path.startswith(extraction_dir ): # this condition will never be True
        raise Exception("Path traversal attempt, aborting.")
```

This is what it looks like:

```
>>> os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd")
'/tmp/../etc/passwd'
>>> os.path.abspath(os.path.join("/tmp", "../etc/passwd"))
'/etc/passwd'
```

# UBI Reader

UBI Reader is a Python module and collection of scripts capable of extracting
the contents of UBI and UBIFS images, along with analyzing these images to
determine the parameter settings to recreate them using the mtd-utils tools.

### Known Issues

These are some known issues, that prevent an exact data dump from occuring.

* This does not replay the journal, so uncommited data will not be retrieved. Data can be in the journal with both clean and unclean shutdowns.
* Depending on how the NAND was dumped, the data bits may not be error corrected.
* Socket files will be ignored, you can change ubireader/settings.py to have it create dummy files in their place.

## Testing Branch

The testing branch includes a tools/ directory, that has scripts to help when trying to extract data from broken images. These also serve as examples of how to use parts of ubi\_reader in custom scripts.

An override system is also included, for manually setting certain parameters that may be reported wrong by the UBI/FS data.

This branch will probably remain seperate, as it is meant to be customized to aid in extracting data from problematic images. You can install it with 'python setup.py develop' to make it easier to modify ubi\_reader as needed.

## Installation:

Latest Version

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader
$ cd ubi_reader
$ poetry install

```

Or

```
$ pip install --user ubi_reader

```

## Usage:

For basic usage, the scripts need no options and if applicable will save output
to ./ubifs-root/. More advanced usage can set start and end offset, specify
an output directory, or for debugging can print out what it is doing to the
terminal.

Run program with -h or --help for explanation of options.

## Extracting File Contents:

```
ubireader_extract_files [options] path/to/file

```

The script accepts a file with UBI or UBIFS data in it, so should work with a NAND
dump. It will search for the first occurance of UBI or UBIFS data and attempt to
extract the contents. If file includes special files, you will need to run as
root or sudo for it to create these files. With out it, it'll skip them and show a
warning that these files were not created.

## List/Copy Files:

```
ubireader_list_files [options] path/to/file

```

The script accepts a file with UBI or UBIFS data in it, so should work with a NAND
dump. It will search for the first occurance of UBI or UBIFS data and treat it as
a UBIFS. To list files supply the path to list (-P, --path), e.g. "-P /" to list
the filesystems root directory. To copy a file from the filesystem to a local directory
supply the source path (-C, --copy) and the destination path (-D, --copy-dest),
e.g. -C /etc/passwd -D . (extract /etc/passwd from the UBIFS image and copy it to
local directory).

## Extracting Images:

```
ubireader_extract_images [options] path/to/file

```

This script will extract the whole UBI or UBIFS image from a NAND dump, or the UBIFS
image from a UBI image. You can specify what type of image to extract by setting the
(-u, --image-type) option to "UBI" or "UBIFS". Default is "UBIFS".

## MTD-Utils Parameters:

```
ubireader_utils_info [options] path/to/file

```

The script will analyze a UBI image and create a Linux shell script and UBI config
file that can be used for building new UBI images to the same specifications. For
just a printed list of the options and values, use the (-r, --show-only) option.

## Display Information:

```
ubireader_display_info [options] path/to/file

```

Depending on the image type found, this script displays some UBI information along with
the header info from the layout block, including volume table records. If it is a UBIFS
image, the Super Node, and both Master Nodes are displayed. Using the (-u, --ubifs-info)
option, it will get the UBIFS info from inside a UBI file instead.

## Display Block Information:

```
ubireader_display_blocks [options] "{'block.attr':?, ...}" path/to/file

```

Search for and display block information. This can be used for debugging failed image
and file extractions. The blocks are searched for using a double quoted Python Dict of
search paramaters, example. "{'peb\_num':[0, 1] + range(100, 102), 'ec\_hdr.ec': 1, 'is\_valid': True}"
This will find PEBs 0, 1, 100, 101, 102, with an erase count of 1 that is a valid block.
Can use any of the parameters in ubireader.ubi.block.description.

## Options:

Some general option flags are

* -l, --log: This prints to screen actions being taken while running.
* -v, --verbose: This basically prints everything about anything happening.
* -p, --peb-size int: Specify PEB size of the UBI image, instead of having it guess.
* -e, --leb-size int: Specify LEB size of UBIFS image, instead of having it guess.
* -s, --start-offset int: Tell script to look for UBI/UBIFS data at given address.
* -n, --end-offset int: Tell script to ignore data after given address in data.
* -g, --guess-offset: Specify offset to start guessing where UBI data is in file. Useful for NAND dumps with false positives before image.
* -w, --warn-only-block-read-errors: Attempts to continue extracting files even with bad block reads. Some data will be missing or corrupted!
* -i, --ignore-block-header-errors: Forces unused and error containing blocks to be included and also displayed with log/verbose.
* -f, --u-boot-fix: Assume blocks with image\_seq 0 are because of older U-boot implementations and include them. \*This may cause issues with multiple UBI image files.
* -o, --output-dir path: Specify where files should be written to, instead of ubi\_reader/output
