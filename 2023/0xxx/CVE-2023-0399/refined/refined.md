- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which can then be executed by other users who view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By using crafted shortcode attributes such as `ioi_caption_url`, `ioi_image_effect`, and `ioi_url_target` when embedding the `image_over_image_vc` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a "contributor" role in WordPress.
