Validate lengths of string attributes

```
When using the MySQL database, Rails automatically sets a limit of 255
characters for string columns. This changes ensures this limit is also
enforced in the validations. For several columns with a different limit,
that different limit is enforced instead.

For the PostgreSQL database, there is no limit in the database, but it
is useful to set a limit anyway to prevent absurdly large values from
being submitted.
