{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient length validation when parsing a crafted MSMMS packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running Wireshark. Exploitation could be achieved by crafting a malicious MSMMS packet.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted MSMMS packet to Wireshark.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send/inject a malicious MSMMS packet to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark. This could involve packet capture/injection in a network environment.",
    "details": "The vulnerability lies within the `dissect_client_transport_info` function, which is called when processing a specific command ID. The function reads a length value from the packet, multiplies it by 8, subtracts 8 from it, and then subtracts 20 before using it as a size parameter when extracting a UTF-16 encoded string using `tvb_get_string_enc`. The `tvb_get_string_enc` function internally allocates a buffer using `wmem_strbuf_new_sized`. The allocated buffer size is based on the length extracted from the packet. The string extraction process within a loop calls `wmem_strbuf_append_unichar` which increases the length of the buffer. After the loop the function `wmem_strbuf_finalize` is called which reallocates the buffer to the size of the processed string. However, the length passed to `tvb_get_string_enc` is not validated causing a heap buffer overflow when the extracted string is used in other functions.",
        "affected_versions": "Wireshark version 4.0.5 and prior.",
       "fix_versions": "Wireshark version 4.0.6 and later"
