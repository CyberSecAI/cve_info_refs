  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The fix for a previous vulnerability (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385118) aimed to prevent masked webhook secrets from being leaked by resetting URL variables when the URL changes. However, the `reset_url_variables` function would not reset URL variables if the URL variables themselves were also changed, allowing a bypass by adding a new parameter to the URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability",
      "Insufficient validation of URL changes",
      "Logic bypass through manipulating URL variables"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with Maintainer role can leak masked webhook secrets by modifying the webhook URL and adding new parameters, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating the webhook URL by adding a new parameter",
        "Exploiting the flawed logic in `reset_url_variables` function"
