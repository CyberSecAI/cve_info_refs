- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Amazon JS plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of other users who visit the page/post. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a shortcode attribute (asin, tmpl, style), which is then stored in the database, and executed when a user views the affected page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges to create or edit posts/pages, and use the plugin shortcodes.
