# Timing sidechannel in RSA decryption

## Description of problem:

The time for GnuTLS to respond to malformed RSA ciphertexts in ClientKeyExchange depends on kind of error in the RSA padding.

Generally, it looks like the response time depends on size of encrypted data in the PKCS#1 v1.5 encrypted data.

I've run tests with 1 million connections per probe, on a 2.4GHz skylake CPU with 1024 bit RSA key, the two probes with most dissimilar results were "too long (49-byte) pre master secret" and "invalid MAC in Finished on pos 0", it takes the server an extra 58.5ns to respond one over the other. This is with a 95% confidence interval of +-6.8ns.

Exact results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are in this [report.csv](/-/project/179611/uploads/d6d97b178d9a488c38025466138a43c0/report.csv) file.

## Version of gnutls used:

gnutls-3.6.8-11.el8\_2.x86\_64

## Distributor of gnutls (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL)

RHEL 8

## How reproducible:

Time the server responses to differently malformed ClientKeyExchange data.

## Actual results:

Timing of server responses depends on the way RSA ciphertext is malformed

## Expected results:

The timing of server responses should be completely independent of the RSA ciphertexts.

## Additional info:

We're aware of other implementations that have the timing sidechannel, we'd like to coordinate the release of this information to the public.
