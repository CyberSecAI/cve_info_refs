Based on the provided content, this commit introduces the use of the `devise_zxcvbn` gem to enforce strong password requirements in the Publify application.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
- The commit aims to enhance password security by requiring users to create strong passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prior to this commit, the application did not enforce strong password policies, potentially leading to weak and easily guessable passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation would involve creating or using weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Password guessing attacks (brute-force, dictionary attacks)
- Social engineering to obtain weak passwords
- Exploitation of user password reuse

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to target the user authentication system or have some knowledge of user passwords to exploit this vulnerability, which no longer exists after the fix.

**Technical Details:**
- The `devise_zxcvbn` gem is added as a dependency.
- The `zxcvbnable` module is included in the `User` model.
- Factory definitions for users are updated to include strong passwords.
- Controller and feature tests are updated to reflect the new password requirements.
- Tests are introduced to verify strong password functionality.
