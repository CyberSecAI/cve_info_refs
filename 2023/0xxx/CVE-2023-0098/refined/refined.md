- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied parameters before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter in the `lasso_lite_group_get_list` AJAX action is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, modification or deletion of database contents. In this specific case, the provided Proof of Concept uses a time-based blind SQL injection, which demonstrates the ability to infer information from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action parameter set to `lasso_lite_group_get_list` and a malicious `keyword` parameter value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least the subscriber role, which is the lowest privilege level in WordPress. They also must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
