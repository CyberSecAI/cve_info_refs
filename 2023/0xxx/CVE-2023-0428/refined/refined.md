- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Watu Quiz plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter, specifically the "title" parameter, before outputting it back into the webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which will then be executed by a user who views the page. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation if the victim is an admin, allowing the attacker to gain control of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the "title" parameter. The victim needs to visit the malicious link while logged in (e.g. an administrator).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload. The victim, ideally an admin, needs to be logged into the WordPress site and must be tricked into opening the crafted URL.
