# Command Injection in D-Link DWL-2600AP with firmware v4.2.0.17

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

### Post-Auth Command Injection as Root

**[AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:X/RC:C/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M/MAV:A/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H&version=3.1) (6.8/6.4)**

An authenticated user can exploit a command injection vulnerability in the firmware-upgrade command in the *restricted* shell that the D-Link access point exposes over telnet, ssh, and console connections, and thereby obtain a full root busybox (ash) shell on the device. This can be done by passing the string \$\(ANY\_COMMAND\ \&\>2\) as an argument, where ANY\_COMMAND is a shell command with spaces and special characters escaped, and \&\>2 serves to redirect output to standard error, making it visible to the attacker.

  ###### critical

  Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the SAML SSO implementation of Sentry. It was reported to us via our private bug bounty program.

The victim email address must be known in order to exploit this vulnerability. The Sentry SaaS fix was deployed on Jan 14, 2025. For self hosted users; if only a single organization is allowed `(SENTRY\_SINGLE\_ORGANIZATION = True)`, then no action is needed. Otherwise, users should upgrade to version 25.1.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
