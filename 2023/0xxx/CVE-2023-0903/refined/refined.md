The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Employee Task Management System".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `task_id` parameter of the `edit-task.php` page before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `task_id` parameter of `edit-task.php`.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation.
- Usage of unsanitized user input in SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute unauthorized SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
- Low-privileged users (employees) can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the entire system, bypassing access controls.
- Data loss or modification, system compromise and reputational damage.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `edit-task.php` with a malicious payload in the `task_id` parameter.
- By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker can retrieve data and potentially manipulate the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user (employee) in the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `edit-task.php` page and manipulate the `task_id` parameter.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
