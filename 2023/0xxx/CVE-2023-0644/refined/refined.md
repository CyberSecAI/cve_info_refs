- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape various parameters before outputting them back in pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads in the `response_message` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a crafted URL.
