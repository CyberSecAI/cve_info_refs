- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser when they view a page or post containing the vulnerable shortcode. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode containing XSS payload and embeds it in a page or post. When a user views this page, the injected script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site to be able to add malicious shortcodes.
