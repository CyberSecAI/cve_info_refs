- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Panorama web interface of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-80), where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored on the server. This code will be executed in the context of another administrator's browser when they view the affected page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of another administrator. This could lead to a range of impacts including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network based and requires the attacker to have authenticated access to the PAN-OS web interface with read-write administrative privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a read-write administrator with access to the Panorama web interface to inject the malicious script.
