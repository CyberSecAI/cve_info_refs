The provided content relates to CVE-2023-0373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Lightweight Accordion plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape block options before outputting them on a page or post. Specifically, the "Additional CSS class(es)" field of the "Lightweight Accordion" Gutenberg block is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which will be executed when a user views the affected page/post. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Stealing sensitive user data
- Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
A user with Contributor role or higher can exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious code within the "Additional CSS class(es)" field of the "Lightweight Accordion" Gutenberg block. The injected code will be stored in the database and executed when the page/post containing the block is accessed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have at least Contributor role privileges on the affected WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages containing the vulnerable block and inject malicious code through the block's options.
