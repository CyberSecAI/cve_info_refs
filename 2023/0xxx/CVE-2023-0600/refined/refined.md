- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input before concatenating it into an SQL query. Specifically, the `visitorId` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can conduct SQL Injection attacks. While the provided information does not specify the extent of what an attacker can achieve, SQL injection can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially compromise the entire database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/?wmcAction=wmcTrack`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `visitorId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.

The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) URL demonstrating how the SQL injection can be triggered:
`https://example.com/?wmcAction=wmcTrack&siteId=34&url=test&uid=01&pid=02&visitorId=132123%27,sleep(10),0,0,0,0,0);--+-`
