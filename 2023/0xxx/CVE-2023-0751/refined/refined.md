{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GELI utility, when reading a key file from standard input, doesn't store it. In batch operations, subsequent devices will receive an empty standard input stream, resulting in a NULL key file being used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "GELI omits keyfile read from stdin in batch device initialization.",
      "Silent use of NULL key file instead of keyfile read from stdin.",
       "Inadequate error handling when stdin is empty."
    ],
    "impact": "Some GELI providers may be silently encrypted with a NULL key file, potentially leading to unauthorized access if decryption depends solely on the keyfile and not a passphrase.",
    "attack_vectors": "Initializing multiple GELI providers at once using a key file from standard input.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to execute GELI commands on a FreeBSD system and knowledge of the vulnerability to exploit. Requires the user to initialize multiple providers at once."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "workaround": "Instead of initializing GELI devices in a batch operation, initialize each provider individually.",
     "solution": "Upgrade to a corrected FreeBSD release or stable branch and re-encrypt the master key of affected GELI providers using the proper key file.",
     "affected_products": [
        "All supported versions of FreeBSD."
