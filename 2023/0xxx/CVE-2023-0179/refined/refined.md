{
  "CVE-2023-0179": {
    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's Netfilter subsystem, specifically within the `nft_payload_copy_vlan` function. An integer underflow in the calculation of `ethlen` can cause a larger than expected memory copy leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer underflow when calculating the ethlen variable in the `nft_payload_copy_vlan` function, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n  - Leakage of stack and heap addresses.\n  - Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) to the root user via arbitrary code execution.\n  - Denial of service",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerable code path is reached when an `nft_payload` expression is used with a VLAN tag present in the current skb (network packet buffer) and the offset falls between the first VLAN_ETH_HLEN bytes and VLAN_ETH_HLEN plus the size of another VLAN header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability which can be achieved through a new user namespace. The attacker also needs to be able to craft nftables rules."
