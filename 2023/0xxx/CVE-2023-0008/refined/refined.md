- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition in the PAN-OS web interface allows for local file disclosure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: File disclosure vulnerability due to a race condition. External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated read-write administrator can export local files from the firewall. The impact is a High Confidentiality Impact, but no Integrity or Availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access through the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated read-write administrator with access to the PAN-OS web interface. The attack complexity is rated as high.
