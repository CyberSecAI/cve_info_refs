- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow or wraparound in the CGI component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can overflow buffers, potentially leading to denial of service and/or limited modification capabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors in the CGI component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with no privileges required
