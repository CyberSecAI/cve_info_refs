## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EAN for WooCommerce < 4.4.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[alg\_wc\_ean\_product\_image product\_id='1' width='100%' height='100%" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
Note: In product\_id, the WooCommerce product id will go.
