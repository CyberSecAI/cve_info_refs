- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ever Compare plugin lacks CSRF protection when activating plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into activating arbitrary plugins on the WordPress site. This could lead to the activation of malicious plugins, potentially allowing for further compromise, such as gaining remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request targeting the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint of the WordPress site, specifically the `ever-compare_ajax_plugin_activation` action. The request includes the path to the plugin to be activated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link, which triggers the crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
