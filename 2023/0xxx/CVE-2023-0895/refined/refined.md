- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. Specifically, the 'id' parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Time-based SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Authenticated attackers with administrative privileges can append additional SQL queries to existing queries. This can lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the 'id' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges.
