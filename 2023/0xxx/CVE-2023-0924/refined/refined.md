- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zyrex Popup plugin does not validate the type of files uploaded when creating a popup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privileged user (such as an Administrator) can upload arbitrary files, including PHP files. When the popup is activated, the uploaded PHP file will be executed, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a new popup and uploading a malicious PHP file as the image for the popup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user, such as an administrator, on the WordPress site.
