- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in a protection mechanism within the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows allows a local user to execute privileged `cytool` commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically a protection mechanism failure (CWE-693).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can disable or uninstall the Cortex XDR agent, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to a Windows machine with the vulnerable Cortex XDR agent installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user account on the Windows machine where the vulnerable Cortex XDR agent is installed, low privileges are required.
