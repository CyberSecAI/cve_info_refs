- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ShopLentor plugin fails to properly validate and escape block options before outputting them on a page or post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin doesn't sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page. This can lead to various impacts like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with at least Contributor role can inject malicious JavaScript code within the "Additional CSS class(es)" field of a "WL : FAQ" Gutenberg block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress website. They also need to be able to add and edit Gutenberg blocks. A Template Builder needs to be present as well.
