- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the GlobalProtect app's reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision, specifically related to how it executes programs on Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists due to improper handling of inputs, allowing a local user to run programs with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a local user to execute arbitrary programs with elevated privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local; an attacker must have local access to the Windows machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low-level privileges on the local Windows system. User interaction is not required.
