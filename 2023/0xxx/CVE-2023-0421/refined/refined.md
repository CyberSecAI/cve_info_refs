- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `ricerca` query parameter before outputting it on an admin panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into executing arbitrary JavaScript code by clicking a crafted link. This can potentially lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious link containing the XSS payload in the `ricerca` parameter is crafted and sent to the administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and convince a logged-in administrator to click it.
