Rockwell Automation Modbus TCP Server AOI prior to 2.04.00 is vulnerable to an unauthorized user sending a malformed message that could cause the controller to respond with a copy of the most recent response to the last valid request. If exploited, an unauthorized user could read the connected deviceâ€™s Modbus TCP Server AOI information.
