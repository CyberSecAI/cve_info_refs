Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** Older Campbell Scientific datalogger devices exposed a web server and the proprietary Pakbus protocol without requiring authentication.
*   **Insecure Configuration Files:** Configuration files containing FTP credentials were stored unencrypted.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The Pakbus protocol could be used to bypass web authentication on newer CR6 devices and download the configuration files, even when web access required login.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The devices allowed arbitrary file uploads via the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** FTP credentials and potentially other sensitive information were exposed in unencrypted configuration files.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The Pakbus protocol allowed bypassing authentication on newer devices via port 6785.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Unrestricted file uploads via the web interface.
*   **Malware Hosting:** The devices were being used to host malware (.zip and .lnk files).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive information such as FTP credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** By bypassing authentication and uploading arbitrary files, attackers could potentially gain full control of the datalogger devices.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers used the devices to host and distribute malware, using them as part of a CoinMiner campaign.
*   **Lateral Movement**: An attacker may leverage the exposed credentials to compromise other systems within a network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Internet Exposure:** Dataloggers were directly exposed to the internet, allowing attackers to scan and target them using tools like Shodan.
*   **Pakbus Protocol Exploitation:**  Attackers could connect to the devices via the Pakbus protocol on port 6785 without authentication (and bypass authentication in newer models).
*   **Web Interface Exploitation:** The devices' web interface was used to upload arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Internet Access:** Attackers need internet access to scan and identify vulnerable datalogger devices.
*   **Knowledge of Pakbus Protocol:** Attackers need knowledge of the Pakbus protocol to communicate with the devices directly.
*   **Programming Skills:** Attackers used a custom Python script to automate the exploitation process.
*   **Ability to identify the exposed devices:** Attackers used Shodan to identify the exposed devices.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected multiple models of Campbell Scientific dataloggers, including older models (like CR800) and newer models (like CR6).
*   The exploitation was achieved through a combination of insecure configurations, lack of authentication, and the use of a custom Python script.
*   The attacker was able to achieve the following:
    *   Connect via PC400 without credentials (on older devices).
    *   Access the web interface without authentication (on older devices).
    *   Download configuration files using a custom script.
    *   Bypass web authentication via Pakbus on newer devices.
    *   Upload arbitrary files.
    *   Download malware hosted on the devices.
*   The information was discovered during an RT exercise.

This vulnerability allowed for significant security breaches including sensitive information exposure, unauthorized access, arbitrary file uploads and malware hosting.
