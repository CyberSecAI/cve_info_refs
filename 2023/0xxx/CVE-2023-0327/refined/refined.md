The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0327, as it describes a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code in `_login.php` was vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserted user-provided input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability in the `_login.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit the SQL injection to bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the `user` and `pass` POST parameters when submitting the login form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login form, meaning they have network access to the web application and the ability to send POST requests to the login page.
