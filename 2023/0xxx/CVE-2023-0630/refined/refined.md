- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a subscriber-level account or higher to exploit this vulnerability.
