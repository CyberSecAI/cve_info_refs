- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper initialization of connection buffers when encoding the `FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST` record.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak due to uninitialized memory being potentially included in the response.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information from the server's memory.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a specially crafted request that triggers the faulty FCGI encoding.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker capable of sending requests to the vulnerable HAProxy server.
