Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `ExportController` in Wallabag was vulnerable to an improper authorization issue. Specifically, the `downloadEntryAction` did not properly verify if the user requesting the export was the owner of the entry being exported.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Authorization:** The controller initially relied on the passed `Entry` object in the method signature to determine authorization. However, this was bypassed by fetching the entry based on the provided `id` parameter, which was not protected against unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially export entries belonging to other users if they knew the entry ID and the correct export URL. This could lead to a privacy breach, where users' private content is accessed and downloaded without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `downloadEntryAction` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter passed in the query string to a valid entry ID that belongs to another user.
- The format parameter was also passed, e.g. `/export/3.mobi` where '3' is the entry id.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a valid user account within the application.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of an entry they want to export which belongs to another user.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves fetching the entry based on the ID from the request parameters and then checking if the currently logged-in user is the owner of that entry. If the user is not the owner, it throws a `NotFoundHttpException`, preventing the export.
- The fix also removes the Entry object injection from method signature.
- The commit introduces a new test case `testForbiddenEntryId` to verify that a user can not access entries owned by other users.

**Additional Notes:**
