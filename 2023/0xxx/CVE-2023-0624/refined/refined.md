The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-0624.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application returns user-controlled input in the response without proper sanitization and with the content-type set to `text/html`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the filename parameter in the download functionality, before reflecting it back in the HTML response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can steal user session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover. The attacker could also execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can further be used for a number of malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious link containing JavaScript code in the filename parameter. When a user clicks on this link, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing emails or other methods to deliver the crafted link. The attacker needs no prior access to the application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web application.
