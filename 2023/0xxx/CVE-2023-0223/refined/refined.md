The provided content relates to **CVE-2023-0223**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the GitLab API exposing release descriptions through the tags API, even when the releases are configured to be visible only to project members. The tag API did not properly check the `:read_release` permission before revealing the release information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Exposure: The release description, which might contain sensitive information, is exposed to unauthenticated users via the tags API.
- Inadequate Access Control: The API does not respect the release visibility settings, allowing unauthorized access to the description.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information contained within release descriptions, even if they are not members of the project, by querying the tags API. This can lead to the disclosure of confidential data and compromise project security.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by making unauthenticated requests to the following endpoint: `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<ID>/repository/tags`. The attacker can then examine the response for the `Release` array and read the description.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or a member of the project.
- They need to know the project ID.
- The project must be set to public with releases restricted to project members only.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes a detailed HackerOne report and a proposed fix implemented in a patch. The fix involves checking the `:read_release` permission in the Tags API before revealing the release data.
