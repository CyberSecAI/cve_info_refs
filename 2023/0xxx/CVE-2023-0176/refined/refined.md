- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within its attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least Contributor role privileges to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
