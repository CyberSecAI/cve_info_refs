- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement when deleting messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. In this specific PoC, the impact is demonstrated with a time-based SQL injection using `sleep(10)`.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited through the `delete_message` parameter when deleting messages from the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an administrator or a user with high privileges to access the vulnerable admin panel page and send the malicious request.
