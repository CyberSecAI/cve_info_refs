Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox plugin has an AJAX endpoint that allows authenticated users (including subscribers) to perform various actions. Critically, one of these actions allows for reading and updating WordPress options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The AJAX endpoint lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to access and manipulate WordPress options.
*   **Broken Access Control:**  Subscriber-level users, who should have limited privileges, can access and modify sensitive system settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By updating the `users_can_register` option to `1` and setting the `default_role` to `administrator`, an attacker can enable open user registration and assign the administrator role to newly registered users. This allows attackers to create an administrator account and gain full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Full Site Takeover:** Once an attacker has administrator access, they can perform any action on the site, including modifying content, installing malicious plugins, deleting data, etc., leading to a full compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely from any location with network access to the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. This can be any user account, including a subscriber role with the lowest privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable AJAX endpoint and the specific parameters to send in the request (as shown in the Proof of Concept).

**Additional details:**
* The provided proof of concept demonstrates the exploit using a simple fetch request in the browser's developer console.
* The vulnerability is classified as "NO AUTHORISATION," indicating that the endpoint lacks proper access control.
* The vulnerability is assigned a high CVSS score of 8.8, highlighting its severity.
* The vulnerability is related to OWASP's "Broken Access Control" (A5) and CWE-862 ("Missing Authorization").
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.8.
