- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin "Shortcode for Font Awesome" does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input validation and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post, which will be executed when a user views the page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the shortcode with malicious attributes within a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit content.
