Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the strided image data parsing code within the emscripten wrapper for libheif. Specifically, it occurs during a `memcpy` call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The code doesn't properly validate the size of data being copied, leading to a potential overflow of the destination buffer. This is in the context of processing strided image data within the emscripten wrapper for libheif.
- Memory Corruption: The buffer overflow could potentially corrupt memory, leading to undefined behavior and potentially malicious outcomes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory Corruption: An attacker could overwrite adjacent memory regions through a controlled buffer overflow which could lead to various consequences.
- Denial of Service: A crash due to the memory corruption could lead to a denial-of-service scenario.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: Depending on the memory layout and the attacker's ability to control the overwritten data, this vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Image File: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file which triggers the faulty parsing logic.
- Libheif emscripten wrapper: The emscripten wrapper of the library is where the vulnerable code resides.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply a crafted HEIF/AVIF image to libheif through the emscripten wrapper.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eugene Lim of GovTech Singapore.
- The affected version is libheif v1.14.2.
- The vulnerability was patched by the vendor on 2023-01-11.
- The vulnerability involves the use of `memcpy` where an incorrectly calculated size can lead to the overflow.
- The fix involves correcting the buffer allocation and data copy process in the `heif_js_decode_image` function.
