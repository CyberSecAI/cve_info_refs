Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `WP Dark Mode` plugin's improper sanitization of the `style` parameter within shortcodes. This parameter is used to load PHP templates, and the lack of sanitization allows for path traversal.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The plugin is vulnerable to LFI due to the unsanitized `style` parameter in the `wp-dark-mode` shortcode. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the path provided in the `style` parameter.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability leverages path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside the intended template directory and access other files on the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials. In the provided example, the attacker is able to read the index.php file, which can contain sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Shortcode Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of a shortcode (`[wp-dark-mode]`) within WordPress. The attacker manipulates the `style` parameter of this shortcode to include arbitrary files.
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` set to `parse-media-shortcode`. This request includes the malicious shortcode in the `body` of the request.
  
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Subscriber Level Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with subscriber level access. This implies an attacker does not need administrative or privileged access.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target WordPress site to send HTTP POST requests.
    *   **Javascript Execution**: The attacker executes Javascript from the browser console to send the malicious request.
