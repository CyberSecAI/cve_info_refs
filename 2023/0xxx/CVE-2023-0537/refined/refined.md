The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0537.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a page or post by exploiting the vulnerable shortcode, which would be executed when a user views the page, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's shortcode functionality, specifically the `psfwl_guten_block` shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level privileges on the WordPress site. They can then insert malicious JavaScript code into the `heading_tag` attribute of the vulnerable shortcode.
