{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mf_thankyou` shortcode in the Metform plugin does not properly validate user access before displaying form submission data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure, Authorization Bypass",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level privileges (or higher) can access sensitive information related to form submissions, including payment status and transaction IDs.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific `mf_thankyou` shortcode with a form submission ID, a subscriber-level attacker can bypass authorization checks and retrieve submission data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with at least subscriber-level privileges. They must also be able to create or modify pages or posts, which can include the crafted shortcode."
