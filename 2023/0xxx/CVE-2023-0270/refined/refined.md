- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which will be executed when a user views the page/post. This could lead to various impacts, including but not limited to, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with the vulnerable attributes and embedding it in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges to be able to embed the malicious shortcode.
