The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0123.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Delta Electronics DOPSoft software. This occurs when the software processes a malformed file, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) - Although this is related to CVE-2023-0124 and not CVE-2023-0123, it is mentioned in the context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the introduction of a malformed file to the software. This implies a file parsing/processing vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted malformed file to the DOPSoft software. The CVSS vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) suggests:
- Local access (AV:L) - the attacker must have local access or be able to provide the malformed file to the local user.
- Low attack complexity (AC:L)
- No privileges required (PR:N)
- User interaction required (UI:R) - a user must open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.
- The impact is on the same scope (S:U).
- High confidentiality (C:H), integrity (I:H) and availability (A:H) impact

The document specifies that while the vulnerabilities are not directly exploitable remotely, the impact can lead to remote code execution. This suggests that if an attacker can get a user to open the file via social engineering or another method, the attacker could execute code.
