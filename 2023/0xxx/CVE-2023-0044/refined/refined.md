Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-0044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Quarkus Form Authentication session cookies are handled when the `Path` attribute is set to `/`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper configuration of the `Path` attribute for session cookies in Quarkus.
- Potential for cross-site attacks due to the wide scope of the cookie path (`/`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A cross-site attack can be initiated.
- This can lead to potential information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Cross-site attack initiated by an attacker leveraging the improperly configured session cookie path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must be able to initiate a cross-site request to exploit the vulnerability.
-  The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious page or performing a malicious action.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated using Quarkus CSRF Prevention feature.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `quarkus-vertx-http` version `2.13.7` and in Red Hat build of Quarkus versions 2.7.7.
- The vulnerability is related to the setting of the `Path` attribute to `/`, which makes the session cookie available for the entire domain which can be exploited in a cross site attack.
