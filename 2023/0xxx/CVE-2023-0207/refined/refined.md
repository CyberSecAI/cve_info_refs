**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0207

**Description:**
NVIDIA DGX-2 SBIOS contains a vulnerability where an attacker may modify the ServerSetup NVRAM variable at runtime by executing privileged code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly detailed, but it involves the ability to modify the ServerSetup NVRAM variable during runtime through privileged code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control that allows modification of the ServerSetup NVRAM variable via privileged code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to execute privileged code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute privileged code on the system.
- High privileges (PR:H) are required for successful exploitation.
- The attack requires a high degree of complexity (AC:H).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects NVIDIA DGX-2 SBIOS.
- The fix is included in SBIOS version 0.33 and later.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5.
- The CVSS vector is AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, meaning it is a local attack requiring high privileges with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability and scope changed.
