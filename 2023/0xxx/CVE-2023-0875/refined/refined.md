- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape inputs into SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, cause denial of service, or perform other malicious actions. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection that can be used to confirm the vulnerability and can be leveraged to extract data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters, including an `action` set to `wpms`, a `task` set to `bulk_image_copy`, and a malicious `ids` array containing a SQL injection payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber level account. The attack can be performed remotely through the web interface.
