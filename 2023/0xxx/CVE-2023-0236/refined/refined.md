- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Tutor LMS plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the `reset_key` and `user_id` parameters before outputting them back into HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This could lead to account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious actions, especially if a high-privilege user is targeted.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `reset_key` or `user_id` parameters. When a user clicks this link, the unsanitized parameters are reflected back into the HTML, causing the JavaScript to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into clicking it. No authentication is required.
