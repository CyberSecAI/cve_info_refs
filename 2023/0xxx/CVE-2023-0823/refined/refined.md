- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By embedding malicious JavaScript within the shortcode attributes `link` and `class`, which are then rendered on a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with the contributor role or higher within the WordPress environment is needed to create/edit a post/page with the malicious shortcode.
