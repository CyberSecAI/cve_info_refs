- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with contributor roles or higher can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages/posts.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with XSS payload and embedding it in a post/page.
