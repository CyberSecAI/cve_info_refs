The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to reCaptcha Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due to insufficient server side checking on the captcha value submitted during a form submission. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass Captcha restrictions and for attackers to utilize bots to submit forms.
