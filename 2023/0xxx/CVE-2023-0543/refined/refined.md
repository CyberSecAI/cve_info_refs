Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within its settings. Specifically, the email and name fields when registering a new user are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin does not sanitize the email and name fields when creating a new subscriber or editing them allowing for malicious Javascript code to be stored in the database and executed when viewed by an administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when an administrator views the affected area.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, or further exploitation of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the "Mailing list" option within the plugin.
- An attacker inputs malicious Javascript code in the email and name fields when creating a new subscriber. The XSS is then triggered when an admin views the "edit subscriber" page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the vulnerable plugin settings. This vulnerability can be exploited even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.
