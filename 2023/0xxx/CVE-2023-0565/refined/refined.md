The provided content is a commit diff from the froxlor/froxlor repository on GitHub. It introduces a check for the existence of a language in the `admin_templates.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the absence of validation of the 'language' parameter when processing email templates, specifically in the `admin_templates.php` file. The code previously accepted any value for language, leading to potential issues if an invalid language was provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of input validation:**  The `admin_templates.php` script did not adequately check if the provided language value actually existed in the `$languages` array. This lack of validation could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Error handling:** If an invalid language is supplied, the application would throw a generic 'templatelanguageinvalid' error message, thus potentially disrupting functionality and not providing a good user experience. While not a critical security vulnerability, it indicates poor input handling, which may be exploited in conjunction with other weaknesses.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could manipulate the `language` POST parameter sent to the `admin_templates.php` page when preparing or sending email templates, providing a language value that does not exist in the `$languages` array of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface where email templates are managed, typically requiring authenticated access. They need to be able to submit a crafted POST request to `admin_templates.php`.

**Additional notes:**
The commit diff adds a check to ensure the language exists in the `$languages` array in both email template preparation and sending code blocks. It also adds the corresponding error message in the German and English language files. The added code uses `array_key_exists` to properly check for valid language keys before proceeding to process the template. This is a bug fix rather than a vulnerability fix.

This commit introduces a fix for a missing input validation.
