Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The application returns unsanitized user input within an HTML context, specifically through the `imgName` parameter in the `/users/done_cropimage` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `imgName` parameter before embedding it in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal user session cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript that sends the cookie information to an attacker-controlled server. This can allow the attacker to impersonate the victim user and access their account.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary javascript in the context of the victim's browser, leading to a variety of malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits the exploit code to the vulnerable endpoint. They then trick the user into clicking the link or visiting this page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Attacker:** The attacker needs to be external to the application and can deliver the exploit via a crafted URL or web page.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious link/page.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTML and Javascript:** The attacker needs to know how to create a basic HTML form to deliver the payload and write Javascript to steal the cookie.
