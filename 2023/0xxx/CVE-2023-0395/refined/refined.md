- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode block options before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with Contributor role or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post that will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit that page/post.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode, such as `[redirect duration="1" location="javascript:alert(1)"]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role in the WordPress site.
