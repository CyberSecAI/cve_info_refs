{
  "CVE-2023-0614": {
    "root_cause": "Samba implemented access control restrictions only after matching objects against the filter, which allowed unauthorized disclosure of confidential attributes via LDAP filters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control enforcement during LDAP filter processing."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain confidential data from Active Directory, such as BitLocker recovery keys, TPM owner passwords, and certificate secret keys stored with Credential Roaming.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation via LDAP filters.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user to perform LDAP searches."
  },
  "CVE-2023-0922": {
    "root_cause": "The Samba AD DC administration tool, when operating against a remote LDAP server, by default sends new or reset passwords over a signed-only connection instead of an encrypted connection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of encryption for password transmission over LDAP connections.",
      "Insecure default setting for 'client ldap sasl wrapping'."

    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack on the network traffic between samba-tool and the Samba AD DC.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic between samba-tool and the Samba AD DC when samba-tool is used to set a password using a Kerberos secured LDAP connection."
