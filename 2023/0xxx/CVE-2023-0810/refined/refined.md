The provided content relates to a commit that addresses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by strengthening Content Security Policy (CSP) rules for static file uploads.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original CSP rules were too permissive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability due to inadequate CSP configuration for static file uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application through uploaded static files, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious static file uploads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be able to upload files.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, but the attacker would likely need to have some kind of upload permission for the server.

**Technical details:**
- The commit modifies the `StorageExtensions.cs` file, specifically changing the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- The original header was set to  `"script-src 'self'"` and was changed to `script-src ;`. This change likely disables the execution of scripts from any source, effectively preventing XSS attacks through uploaded files.
