- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Olevmedia Shortcodes plugin fails to validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into pages or posts. These scripts can then be executed in the browsers of users who visit those pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By using crafted shortcode attributes within a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Users with the Contributor role or higher are able to exploit the vulnerability.
