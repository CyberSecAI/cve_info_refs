- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (such as an administrator) can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modifications, or complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=backend_ajax` and `_action=copy_table` parameters, including a malicious SQL payload within the `table_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative or other high-level privileges to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
