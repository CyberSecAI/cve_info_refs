Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0710

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `mf_thankyou` shortcode in the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before displaying it on a webpage. Specifically, it uses the 'fname' attribute to echo unescaped form submissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected via a form submission and then stored in the database. When the `mf_thankyou` shortcode is used to display the user's form data on a page, the injected script will execute.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user input, specifically the data associated with the 'fname' attribute used in the `mf_thankyou` shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a website that uses the vulnerable plugin.
*   When a user visits a page containing the vulnerable shortcode with a specific form entry ID in the query string, the injected JavaScript will execute in the user's browser.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to submit a form containing malicious JavaScript in the field that will be used by the `fname` parameter of the `mf_thankyou` shortcode.
*   The attacker needs to craft a link that includes the submission ID in the query string and then lure a victim into visiting that URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to submit the form.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit a crafted URL for the XSS to be triggered. The vulnerability is not triggered simply by visiting a page with the vulnerable shortcode unless the crafted link with the form ID is present.
*   **Successful Payment:** The stored XSS payload is associated with a form submission, which, based on the description, requires a successful payment which adds complexity to the attack vector.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder versions up to and including 3.3.0.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.3.1.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `shortcode.php` file.
*   The `mf_thankyou` shortcode uses the `fname` attribute to display form data, which is not properly sanitized.
