- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page/post containing the vulnerable shortcode. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a malicious payload within the shortcode attributes when creating or editing a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role within the WordPress site to create or edit posts.
