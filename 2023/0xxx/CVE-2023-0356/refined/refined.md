- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SOCOMEC MODULYS GP Netvision versions 7.20 and prior lack strong encryption for credentials on HTTP connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak encoding for passwords. Credentials transmitted over HTTP are not strongly encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain sensitive information on the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device. The CVSS vector string indicates:
    - **AV:A** (Adjacent Network): Attacker has access to the network segment where the vulnerable device is located
    - **AC:L** (Low): No special conditions are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **PR:N** (None): No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:R** (Required): User interaction is required for the exploit (this might need more clarification based on the device)
    - **S:U** (Unchanged): The vulnerability does not affect other components of the system.
    - **C:H** (High): There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:N** (None): There is no impact on integrity.
    - **A:N** (None): There is no impact on availability.
