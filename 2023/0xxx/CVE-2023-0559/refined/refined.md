- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser when they view the affected page/post.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker inserts a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role privileges to be able to create or edit posts/pages.
