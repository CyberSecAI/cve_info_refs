- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a page/post containing the vulnerable shortcode, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious shortcode with a payload in the `theme` attribute, then embeds it in a WordPress page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A WordPress user with Contributor role or higher can embed the malicious shortcode.
