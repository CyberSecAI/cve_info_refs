- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Output Neutralization for Logs (CWE-117). Malicious packets sent to the Geo SCADA server's database web port (default 443) are not properly sanitized before being written to log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper output sanitization. Allows for arbitrary text injection into log files, which could include falsified entries or filling log files with bad data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Compromise of product log files. This can lead to misinterpretation of logs due to injected/falsified data, potentially hiding malicious activity or confusing forensic analysis.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious network packets to the Geo SCADA server's database web port (default 443).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the Geo SCADA server's database web port. No authentication or special privileges are explicitly required.
