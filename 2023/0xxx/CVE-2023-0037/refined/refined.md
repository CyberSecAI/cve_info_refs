Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `10WebMapBuilder` plugin failing to properly sanitize and escape parameters before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, these vulnerable SQL queries are triggered via an AJAX action accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The plugin is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to a full compromise of the WordPress site.
- The provided proof of concept shows the potential for a time-based blind SQL injection which could be used to extract data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated AJAX requests:** The vulnerability is exposed through an AJAX action that does not require user authentication. This allows an attacker to send malicious requests without needing any valid user credentials.
- **HTTP POST requests:** The attack is carried out via crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication or special privileges.
- The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the target server.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific vulnerable parameters are `radius`, `lat`, `lng`, and `distance_in`.
- The vulnerability affects `wd-google-maps` plugin versions prior to 1.0.73.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command) and falls under OWASP Top 10 A1: Injection category.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 (High).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Krohmer and Kunal Sharma.
