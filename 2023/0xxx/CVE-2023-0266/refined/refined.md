{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing locking in `ctl_elem_read_user`/`ctl_elem_write_user` when handling `SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_READ` and `SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_WRITE` ioctls in the ALSA sound subsystem, specifically in the compat (32-bit) path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user, denial of service (crash or memory corruption).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user can exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with ability to call the affected ioctls.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is triggered in the 32-bit compatibility path where the lock is not properly acquired within the `snd_ctl_elem_read` function before accessing shared resources. This can lead to a use-after-free condition if the control is freed elsewhere, and subsequently accessed again. Specifically, the `snd_ctl_elem_write_read_compat` function calls `snd_ctl_elem_read` without acquiring the `controls_rwsem` lock."
