- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when determining which log files to display. Specifically, the `aiowps_system_log_file` parameter in the settings page is vulnerable to path traversal.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrative privileges can view the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive information. They can also list directory contents which may help with identifying accessible resources. The plugin only displays the last 50 lines of a file, limiting the direct impact of reading very long files, but this is often enough to extract sensitive information.

- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user with admin access can send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `admin.php` page with a modified `aiowps_system_log_file` parameter that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site.
