- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has an AJAX endpoint that allows users with at least Author privileges to upload arbitrary files due to incorrect file extension validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation of file extensions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Author privileges can upload arbitrary files, such as PHP files, to the server. This could lead to remote code execution and full compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the AJAX endpoint used by the "Auto Featured Image" plugin by crafting a specific POST request using the plugin's `upload_to_library` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least Author privileges on the WordPress site. The attacker also needs to be able to interact with the browser console to obtain the required nonce value.
