- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate some of its shortcode attributes before using them to generate an HTML tag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a crafted shortcode with malicious script in an attribute. The provided proof of concept is `[tx_heading tag='script' heading_text='alert(/XSS/)']`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least the "contributor" role within the WordPress site to be able to add content with shortcodes.
