{
  "CVE-2023-0508": {
    "Description": "The endpoint responsible for downloading packages from the GitLab Package Registry is vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. By adding %0d%0a characters in the URL, it's possible to cancel the default redirection and set an attacker-controlled value inside the Location header. This can be exploited to create an open-redirection attack.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in the URL, allowing carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) to be injected into the HTTP response headers.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP Response Splitting",
      "Open Redirection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Users can be redirected to malicious websites disguised as legitimate GitLab instances, potentially leading to phishing attacks, credential theft, or malware distribution.",
    "Attack vector": "By crafting a URL containing the '%0d%0a' sequence followed by the attacker's desired URL, an attacker can manipulate the 'Location' header in the HTTP response to redirect victims to an arbitrary URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL, and the victim needs to click on the crafted URL.",
     "Affected component": "GitLab Package Registry download endpoint"
  }
