# Report Security Issues

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

### Purpose

In u-blox, the safety and security of our customers and users has always been a top priority. We are dedicated to improving our products continuously, focusing on changing market needs, technologic breakthrough, as well as evolving threat surface and new attack vectors. This Responsible Disclosure Policy is in place to identify new vulnerabilities and security issues in the relevant hardware, software or services provided by u-blox (“u-blox Products”) and to address them in a timely manner.

### Scope

You can use this platform to report a vulnerability/security issue in any u‑blox Product, **excluding** end-of-life u‑blox products/services. In addition, u-blox is running an in-invite only bug-bounty program for certain u-blox services, that is operated in partnership with BugCrowd, for which you can apply (u-blox Bug Bounty Program on [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com)).

Reporting a vulnerability in a good faith and by academical/private research is possible through our Responsible Disclosure Policy and is not going to be penalized. Targeted, malicious or persistent attacks, however, are strictly forbidden and will be reported to the relevant authorities in accordance with the relevant laws.

**How to report**

If you are an existing u-blox customer, you can submit a vulnerability/security issue report creating a support ticket in [u-blox support portal](https://portal.u-blox.com/s/login/?startURL=%2Fs%2Fcontactsupport%3Ft%3D1582635117840).

In case you participate in the bug bounty program, please report your findings through Bugcrowd platform. In other cases, please contact us at security@u-blox.com.

### Secure communication

When reporting a security issue through email, do not send us any issue information in the initial message. Instead, send us the following information:

* Your contact details
* Preferred form of secure communication (e.g. PGP or S/MIME)

[PGP public key](https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/documents/u-blox_Security_0x8CF5192F_public.asc) and fingerprint: 6605 81FD 1F29 FB7A EEB4 F72E FA86 5A68 CF51 92F

### Reporting the issue

**After we have established the secure communication**, please send us the following information to be able to address the issue:

* u-blox Product(s) affected, including version numbers;
* Vulnerability/security issue type, e.g. spoofing, tampering, remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege;
* When and how did you learn about the vulnerability/security issue?
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability/security issue including technical details;
* Supporting evidence, e.g. logs, screenshots, pictures, exploit code.

Please include only information necessary for u-blox to analyze the vulnerability/security issue properly, i.e. do not submit any personal or sensitive personal information. All your personal data will be processed in accordance with u-blox’s [Privacy Policy](/info/u-blox-privacy-policy).

### Follow-up actions

u-blox will assess each submission received. After your message, the following actions will be undertaken:

* The vulnerability/security issue will be prioritized analyzing the potential impact and exposure;
* We will confirm to you that we have received your report by an assigned security representative;
* We might request additional information from you as needed to investigate and resolve the issue;
* According to the nature of the vulnerability/security issue, we will fix and notify you, our customers and/or regulatory authorities, or take other actions as necessary.

To prevent exploitation of reported vulnerabilities/security issues before workarounds or fixes are available, we kindly ask you to refrain from disclosing the vulnerability/security issue until u-blox allows you to do so.

To recognize your contributions aside from payouts through the invite-only bug bounty program, we may, upon your authorization, thank you through an entry in the Acknowledgements section below. Please also note that as to your contribution made the terms and conditions for the [u-blox website apply](/terms-conditions-u-blox-website), and u-blox will thus be able to use any information provided in any commercial context.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all individuals and companies who have reported security issues in u-blox infrastructure or Products.

This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT commands.    Customers should ensures that the TOBY-L2 serial port is available only to internal applications of the device and that the application only allows the use of verified AT commands.
