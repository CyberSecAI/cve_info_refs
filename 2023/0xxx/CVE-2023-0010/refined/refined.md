- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Captive Portal feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A JavaScript payload can be executed in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal userâ€™s browser, when the user clicks on a specially crafted link. This could potentially allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link that includes the JavaScript payload. The victim must then click on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges, but does need to craft a malicious link and distribute it to a user that is using a vulnerable Captive Portal. A user with low privileges is required.
