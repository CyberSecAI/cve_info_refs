- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate a parameter passed to the `php extract()` function when loading templates. This allows an attacker to control the template path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unauthenticated arbitrary file read due to path traversal vulnerability.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) via PHP filter chains, by exploiting the arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This can be escalated to achieve Remote Code Execution by using PHP filter chains.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious template path in the `options[template]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can perform the attack remotely.
