# Ambiguous branch name exploitation in GitLab

**[HackerOne report #1831547](https://hackerone.com/reports/1831547)** by `inspector-ambitious` on 2023-01-11, assigned to [@fvpotvin](/fvpotvin "Félix Veillette-Potvin"):

## Report

#### Summary

##### Introduction

I was curious to know what would happen on a GitLab repository if I was creating branches with ambiguous symbolic ref names. After a few experiments, I believe I found one vulnerability that would allow an attacker to lure users into thinking a repository content is safe. Please note that I already reported a quite similar attack in #1831543, but this one do not use tag it uses ambiguous branch names confusion.

##### A quick recap about symbolic ref names

The following is extracted from this [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-emltrefnamegtemegemmasterememheadsmasterememrefsheadsmasterem).

> A symbolic ref name. E.g. `master` typically means the commit object referenced by `refs/heads/master`. If you happen to have both `heads/master` and `tags/master`, you can explicitly say heads/master to tell Git which one you mean. When ambiguous, a `<refname>` is disambiguated by taking the first match in the following rules:
>
> If $GIT\_DIR/`<refname>` exists, that is what you mean (this is usually useful only for HEAD, FETCH\_HEAD, ORIG\_HEAD, MERGE\_HEAD and CHERRY\_PICK\_HEAD);
>
> * otherwise, refs/`<refname>` if it exists;
> * otherwise, refs/tags/`<refname>` if it exists;
> * otherwise, refs/heads/`<refname>` if it exists;
> * otherwise, refs/remotes/`<refname>` if it exists;
> * otherwise, refs/remotes/`<refname>`/HEAD if it exists.

In the following exploitation scenario, we're going to abuse the fact that the following symbolic reference name

`refs/heads/foo`, can resolve to two distinct branches either `refs/heads/foo` or `refs/heads/refs/heads/foo`.

#### Steps to reproduce

This scenario was tested on a local instance of GitLab 15.6.2-ee at the URL `http://gitlab.ubuntu/`.

##### Step 1: The malicious `refs/heads/main` default branch

A user named `inspector-ambitious` creates an empty new repo named `repo0` (without a README).

`inspector-ambitious` will then create a branch named `refs/heads/main` containing a malicious script named `./script.sh`. That branch will become the default branch since the repo was empty.

From the command line, it would look like this

```
git clone git@gitlab.ubuntu:inspector-ambitious/repo0.git
cd repo0
echo "echo 'execute malicious code'" >> script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
git add script.sh
git commit -m "malicious script"
git branch -M hack
git push origin hack:refs/heads/refs/heads/main
```

[![issue1_screenshot1.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/f2eb3d7fbe420d9514c31df2663d45602731f1e1/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f36346536366533342d323038642d346130312d616538302d3462343565376665333638352f6973737565315f73637265656e73686f74312e706e67)

Note in the screenshot above that the default branch is `refs/heads/main` and the commit name is `malicious script`.

##### Step 2: The genuine `main` branch

Then `inspector-ambitious` creates a `main` branch in the repository containing as well a `./script.sh` but this time the content of `./script.sh` is genuine and safe to execute.

From the command line, it would look like this

```
mkdir repo0_genuine
cd repo0_genuine
echo "echo 'this is genuine'" >> script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
git init
git add script.sh
git commit -m "genuine script"
git branch -M genuine
git remote add origin git@gitlab.ubuntu:inspector-ambitious/repo0.git
git push origin genuine
```

The next step is to create a `main` branch from the `genuine` branch in GitLab UI, since trying push directly a branch called `main` with the command line will result in an error.

##### Step 3: The victim clone the repo and execute the script

Now let's say the user `victim` goes to the repository `http://gitlab.ubuntu/inspector-ambitious/repo0/`, `victim` will see the following.

[![issue1_screenshot3.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/698d294a6a1747d7706e9c52c51b5ca858a4ad9a/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f61366132623863332d323432392d343164642d396232312d3831373434386161373236312f6973737565315f73637265656e73686f74332e706e67)

While the default branch is `refs/heads/main`, `victim` will see the content of `main` branch instead, note the commit name `genuine script`. And if `victim` was cloning the repository and executing `script.sh`, it will be the malicious code that would be executed instead.

[![issue1_screenshot4.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/fac5dc8412ca9b36b6562b3076e8c5bbdc70d541/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f32393933353166312d313734312d346136662d383232302d6339643030366166326134652f6973737565315f73637265656e73686f74342e706e67)

I also tested the download of the zip file and it is not vulnerable, the `victim` would download the `main` branch instead of the `refs/heads/main` branch.

#### Impact

Malicious repositories could be created to lure users into executing what they think is safe code, resulting in the takeover of the victim system.

#### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com and but i did most of my testing on a local instance of GitLab 15.6.2-ee.

#### Impact

Malicious repositories could be created to lure users into executing what they think is safe code, resulting in the takeover of the victim system.
