{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Git's ambiguous symbolic ref name resolution allows for confusion between branches. Specifically, a branch named `refs/heads/main` can be created, which is different from a branch named `main`, but when a user views the repository, GitLab may display the content of the `main` branch, while the underlying git operations, such as cloning, may use the `refs/heads/main` branch if it exists. This discrepancy leads to the user executing potentially malicious code from the `refs/heads/main` branch, believing it's from the safe `main` branch.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Ambiguous symbolic ref name resolution in Git.",
    "GitLab's UI displays content from a branch that does not necessarily correspond to the branch that is cloned via git operations."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create a malicious branch named `refs/heads/main` containing harmful code. When a victim clones the repository, they will obtain the malicious branch's content instead of the safe `main` branch, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker creates a malicious branch named `refs/heads/main`.",
    "The victim clones the repository, unknowingly retrieving the malicious branch due to git's ambiguous symbolic ref resolution.",
     "The victim executes a script they believe to be safe, which is actually a malicious script."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create branches in a GitLab repository, and they need to be able to name a branch with a name like `refs/heads/main`."
