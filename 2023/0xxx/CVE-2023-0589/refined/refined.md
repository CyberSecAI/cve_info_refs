The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0589.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Image Carousel" does not properly sanitize and escape parameters when processing shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings or by using shortcodes within a post/page. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as:
    - Data theft.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
    - Inserting malicious settings via the plugin's settings page.
    - Utilizing a crafted shortcode, such as `[wpic speed='""}); alert(1); jQuery({"temp":true']`, in a post or page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with a role of "Contributor" or higher.
    - The attacker must have the ability to create or edit posts/pages to insert the malicious shortcode.
