## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Image Carousel <= 1.0.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin settings and insert all the settings, then save.
2. Insert the following shortcode in a post/page: [wpic speed='""}); alert(1); jQuery({"temp":true']
