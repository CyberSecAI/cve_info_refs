{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue in the `gf_text_get_utf8_line` function, specifically related to handling of non-UTF8 characters within the text processing logic. There's an issue where the function does not handle UTF8 encoding correctly when converting it from a potentially different encoding, specifically when converting multi-byte characters resulting in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a crafted text file to the affected function. Inputting a line with non-UTF8 characters or a sequence of them can cause the overflow.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted text file. "
