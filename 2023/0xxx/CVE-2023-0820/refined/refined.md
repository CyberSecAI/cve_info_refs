- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "User Role by BestWebSoft" versions before 1.6.7 does not implement CSRF protection when updating user role capabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify user role permissions without the victim's consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary privilege escalation, where an attacker can grant any user role administrative or other high-privilege capabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious request (as demonstrated in the Proof of Concept) and tricks a logged-in administrator into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication but requires a logged-in administrator to visit a page containing the crafted malicious request (social engineering).
