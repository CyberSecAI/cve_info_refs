{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CRLF injection vulnerability exists due to lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data placed into HTTP header fields.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject new HTTP header fields or entirely new requests into the data stream. This can lead to the server misinterpreting requests, causing logical errors and misbehaviors.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting CRLF sequences into HTTP header field values via untrusted data inputs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the data that is being used to populate HTTP header fields in the Async HTTP Client."
