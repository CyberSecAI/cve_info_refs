  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mf` shortcode in Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin does not properly validate user access, allowing subscribers or higher-level users to access sensitive form submission data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure, Authorization Bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with subscriber level access or above can obtain sensitive information about any standard form field of any form submission.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited using the `mf` shortcode, by providing a form submission ID via a GET parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a subscriber role or higher. They also need to be aware of the form ID to access the data."
