Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The "Donation Block For PayPal" WordPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post.

**Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of shortcode attributes.

**Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This malicious code can be executed when a user views the page/post containing the vulnerable shortcode, potentially leading to:
   *  Session hijacking.
   *  Defacement of the website.
   *  Redirection to malicious websites.
   *  Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vector:**
   *  The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's shortcode.
   *  The attacker crafts a malicious shortcode using the `paypal_donation_block` shortcode and injects it with a payload in the `size` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to have at least Contributor access to the WordPress site, allowing them to create or edit posts/pages and inject the malicious shortcode.

**Proof of Concept:**
   * The provided proof of concept is: `[paypal\_donation\_block size='" onmouseover="alert(1)"']`

**Affected Plugin:** Donation Block For PayPal versions prior to 2.1.0

**CVSS Score:** 6.8 (Medium)
