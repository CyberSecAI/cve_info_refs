{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users with the contributor role and above can perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the browser of other users visiting the affected page/post.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious shortcode with a Javascript payload within an attribute, an attacker can inject the code into the affected page/post.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be at least a contributor user to create or edit pages/posts and embed the malicious shortcode."
