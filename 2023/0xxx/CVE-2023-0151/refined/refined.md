- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with Contributor or higher role can inject malicious scripts into pages/posts that will be executed when other users visit them, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code into shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in WordPress.
