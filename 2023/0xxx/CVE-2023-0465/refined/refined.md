       "summary": "The vulnerability stems from OpenSSL's failure to properly enforce certificate policy validation in leaf certificates. Specifically, the system was designed to check for validity but subsequently ignored the invalid policy flag. This flaw could enable a malicious Certificate Authority (CA) to issue certificates with invalid policy extensions, bypassing necessary checks. The vulnerability is triggered when policy processing is enabled with the `-policy` argument or by the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function, which is not the default configuration. Exploitation involves a malicious CA crafting and issuing a certificate that asserts an invalid policy, thereby circumventing policy checks during certificate verification."
