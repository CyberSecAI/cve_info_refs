hello, can you please help me with this?

I downloaded the vulnerable version on virtual box.

I can ping it.

I created an account and was able to log in.

I tried to run the exploit with nc running, the code runs and gives me ([-] Everything seems ok, check your listener.)

nc doesn't show anything. what could be the problem? thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.
