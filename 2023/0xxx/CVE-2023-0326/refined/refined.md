Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the exposure of authentication headers in plain text within the "Evidence" field of vulnerability reports generated by the GitLab DAST API scanner.  Specifically, when the DAST API scanner detects an authentication bypass vulnerability, it includes the authentication header used in the test case within the report's "Evidence" section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive authentication information (specifically, the Authorization header, which can contain usernames, passwords or tokens) in plain text in the DAST API scanner reports.
*   **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The DAST report generation process fails to properly sanitize or mask the authentication header before including it in the vulnerability report's "Evidence" field. Even though the report itself masks the header, the evidence portion does not.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** These reports and job artifacts are accessible to users with lower access levels. In public projects, they can be viewed by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Leakage:** Attackers can obtain the authentication credentials used to access the API being tested.
*   **Unauthorized API Access:** With the leaked credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the API and its resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DAST API Scan:** An attacker would need to trigger a DAST API scan that identifies an authentication bypass vulnerability.
*   **Report Access:** The attacker must then have access to the vulnerability report or job artifacts containing the leaked credentials. This can be easily achieved if the project is public or the user has a low access level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Access to GitLab Project:** The attacker needs access to the GitLab project where the DAST API scan was executed. This could be as little as being an unauthenticated user in the case of a public project.
*   **Knowledge of where to find the reports/artifacts** The attacker must be able to navigate to the vulnerability reports or job artifacts, which contain the exposed credentials in the evidence field.
