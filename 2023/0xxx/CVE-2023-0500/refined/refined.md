- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Film Studio plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when activating plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks on plugin activation functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to activate arbitrary plugins present on the blog. This could allow the attacker to enable malicious plugins or other plugins that could be used to further compromise the site.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is achieved through a CSRF attack where a malicious request is crafted and sent to the vulnerable server through the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that will trigger the crafted CSRF request.
