- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by sending a specially crafted input that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application, but the advisory notes a low attack complexity. The CVSS vector also shows that no privileges are required and the vulnerability has user interaction.
