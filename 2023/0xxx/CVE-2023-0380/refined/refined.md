- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape some block options before outputting them within a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users who view the affected pages or posts. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding the "EDD Buy Button" Gutenberg block to a post and including a malicious payload in the "Additional CSS class(es)" advanced block settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role within the WordPress site. They also need to create or edit a post/page. A download must also exist in order for the vulnerability to trigger.
