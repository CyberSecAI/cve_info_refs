## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Digital Downloads < 3.1.0.5 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;"
Note: At least one Download need to exist for the issue to trigger.
