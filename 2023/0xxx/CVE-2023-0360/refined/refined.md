- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Location Weather plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them in a page or post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected website, which can be executed when a user views the page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a "Location Weather" Gutenberg block and inserting malicious JavaScript code (e.g. `< onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;">`) into the "Additional CSS class(es)" option of the block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least Contributor role privileges on the WordPress site to be able to create/edit posts or pages and insert/modify the malicious Gutenberg block option.
