- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The QuickSwish WordPress plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when activating plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not validate the origin of requests for plugin activation, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to activate an arbitrary plugin present on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a CSRF attack, where the attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in admin, activates a plugin specified by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into triggering the malicious request, which can be done by embedding it in a website or an email. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
