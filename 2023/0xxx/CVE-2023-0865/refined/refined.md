Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper access control in the WooCommerce Multiple Customer Addresses & Shipping plugin. The plugin doesn't verify if the user making a request to add, update, retrieve, delete, or duplicate an address is the owner of that address or a user with high privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user (even with low privileges like a subscriber) to manipulate address data of other users by directly referencing their IDs in API requests.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to enforce proper access control policies, leading to the IDOR vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can retrieve, modify, delete or duplicate the addresses of other users
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive address information of other users.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can add, update or delete addresses of other users, potentially disrupting shipping processes or leading to other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed using HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint.
*   **Exploitation via AJAX requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting specific AJAX requests with the `action` parameter set to `wcmca_get_address_by_id`, `wcmca_delete_address` or `wcmca_save_new_address` and manipulating the `user_id` and `address_id` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, even a low-privileged subscriber account is sufficient.
*   **Knowledge of target user IDs:** Attackers need to be aware of the user IDs they want to target or can iterate through user ids.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests, this can be done through a browser console.
