Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0846:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a commit related to a fix for XSS vulnerability with the title "NMS-14877: Fixed XSS in display of alarm reduction-key". While the CVE description is a placeholder, this XSS fix aligns with a common type of vulnerability covered by CVEs. Therefore, the content is potentially related to a CVE, though without the official description it is hard to confirm if this is CVE-2023-0846.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the alarm reduction key is displayed in the `detail.jsp` file. The application was directly outputting the value of  `alarm.getReductionKey()` without proper sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code in the reduction key field that will be executed on the client's browser when viewing alarm details.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (in this case, the alarm reduction key).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts into the alarm reduction key. When a user views the alarm details, this script would execute within their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks

*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to find a way to set a malicious string as an alarm reduction key. This might involve manipulating data within the OpenNMS system or exploiting another vulnerability to inject this value.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to modify or control alarm data within the OpenNMS system to inject the malicious reduction key. This could involve:
    *   Having administrator-level access.
    *   Exploiting another vulnerability allowing them to modify alarms.
    *   Compromising an authorized account to create a malicious alarm.

**3. Technical Details:**

The fix implemented in the commit sanitizes the `alarm.getReductionKey()` value using `WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString()` before displaying it:
```jsp
- <%=alarm.getReductionKey()%>
+ <%=WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString(alarm.getReductionKey())%>
```
The `WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString()` function likely encodes or removes any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code, preventing the XSS attack.

**4. Additional Information:**

The provided text also references several other bug fixes and enhancements in various OpenNMS Meridian releases, which are not directly relevant to this specific XSS vulnerability but provide broader context about the project's development and security practices.

**Summary**

The content describes an XSS vulnerability arising from improper handling of the alarm reduction key when displaying alarm details within the OpenNMS Meridian platform. The root cause is a lack of sanitization, leading to the potential for malicious script injection. The fix involves using `WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString()` to encode the user-supplied input.
