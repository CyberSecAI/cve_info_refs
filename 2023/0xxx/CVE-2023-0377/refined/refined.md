- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embedded. Specifically, the "Additional CSS class(es)" advanced block option is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a "Scriptless Social Sharing" Gutenberg block to a post and inserting malicious JavaScript into the "Additional CSS class(es)" block option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least Contributor level access to create and edit posts. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the XSS, any user who views the page with the malicious block will trigger the XSS.
