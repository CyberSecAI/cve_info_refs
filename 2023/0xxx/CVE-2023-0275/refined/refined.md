- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious input in the shortcode attributes, specifically within the `email`, `description`, and `cbt` attributes, an attacker can inject XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with Contributor role or higher is required to insert the crafted shortcode into a page or post.
