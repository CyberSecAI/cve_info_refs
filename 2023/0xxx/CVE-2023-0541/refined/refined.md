- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into pages/posts, which can be executed when a user views the page, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript in the `theme` attribute
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
