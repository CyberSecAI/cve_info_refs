**Description:** A security vulnerability known as IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) has been discovered in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to target devices by manipulating the encoded URL used in the connection. To exploit this vulnerability, all information in the encoded URL and the values stored in Single Connect had to be correct and in the correct order.

**Affected Release:** Single Connect 2.16

**Resolution:** Immediate action was taken to resolve the issue and the problem was fixed in the Single Connect 2.16.1 release. The resolution involved addressing the vulnerability and implementing measures to prevent a similar situation from happening in future releases. The quick response to this vulnerability ensured that the security of RDP connections was maintained, and users could continue using the service without any interruption.
