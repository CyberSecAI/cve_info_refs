- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape certain block options before outputting them, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS due to improper input sanitization and output encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who view a page or post where the vulnerable block is embedded. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with the "contributor" role or higher can insert the malicious payload in the "Additional CSS class" setting of the "Inline Popular Posts" block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. They must be able to create or edit posts/pages and utilize the vulnerable block's settings.
