- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Paid Memberships Pro plugin fails to sanitize shortcode attributes, leading to direct concatenation into SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious shortcode via the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a subscriber to exploit the vulnerability.
