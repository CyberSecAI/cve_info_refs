- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed when a user views the affected page/post, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by embedding a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript within its attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level privileges on the WordPress site to create or edit content and insert the malicious shortcode.
