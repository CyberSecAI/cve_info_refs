* ### Reporting

  + [Policy](/eclipse-birt/birt/security/policy)
  + [Advisories](/eclipse-birt/birt/security/advisories)

### SECURITY.md

*ISO 27005 defines vulnerability as:
"A weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats."*

## The Eclipse Security Team

The Eclipse Security Team provides help and advice to Eclipse projects
on vulnerability issues and is the first point of contact
for handling security vulnerabilities.
Members of the Security Team are committers on Eclipse Projects
and members of the Eclipse Architecture Council.

Contact the Eclipse Security Team.

**Note that, as a matter of policy, the security team does not open attachments.**

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported either via email to the Eclipse Security Team
or directly with a project via the Eclipse Foundation's Bugzilla instance.

The general security mailing list address is security@eclipse.org.
Members of the Eclipse Security Team will receive messages sent to this address.
This address should be used only for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities;
regular issue reports and questions unrelated to vulnerabilities in Eclipse software
will be ignored.
Note that this email address is not encrypted.

The community is also encouraged to report vulnerabilities using the
[Eclipse Foundation's Bugzilla instance](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community&component=Vulnerability%20Reports&keywords=security&groups=Security_Advisories).
Note that you will require an Eclipse Foundation account to create an issue report,
but by doing so you will be able to participate directly in the resolution of the issue.

Issue reports related to vulnerabilities must be marked as "committers-only",
either automatically by clicking the provided link, by the reporter,
or by a committer during the triage process.
Note that issues marked "committers-only" are visible to all Eclipse committers.
By default, a "committers-only" issue is also accessible to the reporter
and individuals explicitly indicated in the "cc" list.

## Disclosure

Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter and all Eclipse Committers,
but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public.
The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the
[Eclipse Security Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).

Publicly disclosed issues are listed on the
[Disclosed Vulnerabilities Page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/known.php).

This issue could allow an authenticated attackers to execute commands on the underlying server. Indeed, the default configuration of BIRT Viewer allows specifying report paths that match the current domain. However, in certain configurations, it does not check properly the origin of a Report Design file.  Find attached our advisory of the vulnerability.

When reading the report, do I understand correctly that this is the solution?  The response to this request must be intercepted to either: â¢ Obtain a viewingSessionId, required to make the request to the SOAP endpoint that will effectively execute the command. â¢ Modify the HTML base tag (which is reflected from the edited Host header) so that the browser makes the subsequent requests to the correct server. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=580391#c8)  Louis Wolfers [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2022-12-01 09:39:35 EST  ``` Hello Wim,  No, that's a step the attacker needs to do in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability.  The vulnerability relies on the fact that Birt uses the Host header to verify if the __report parameter is pointing to the current domain. However, an attacker can modify the Host header and the request would still be processed on poorly configured Apache servers (e.g. when no virtual hosts are defined).  My recommendation would be to:  - Set "none" as the default value for the URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY parameter.  - Create a new URL_REPORT_DOMAIN_POLICY parameter that contains the list of authorized domains from which reports can be retrieved if the URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY's value is "domain".  This is my opinion, but I would also remove the "all" value for the URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY or at the very least indicate on the documentation that this parameter is really unsafe by default (I've seen this value being set without any firewalling). It should also be made very clear to the users that using remote paths for reports from untrusted sources is dangerous and can lead to remote code execution. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=580391#c9)  Louis Wolfers [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2023-01-03 04:58:44 EST  ``` Hello and happy new year!

Hi Louis,  Thank you for your persistence. I agree with your analysis.   So the problem is that getting the hostname from the request is a vulnerability because that can be spoofed in the request.   Is this BIRT's job to handle? How can we possibly code against all vulnerabilities in the server we are running on? Or code against ill-configured web servers?

I do not think it should be BIRT's job to handle, to a certain extent: this vulnerability appears using the default configuration of Apache Tomcat and the default configuration of BIRT.  Another way of solving this issue is by only modifying the default configuration of BIRT (URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY to none) and warning the user of potential security issues if their configuration allows arbitrary content on the Host header.

# RCE on the default configuration of BIRT Viewer by tampering the HTTP Host header

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence Reporting Tool)

**Project id:** technology.birt

**Versions affected:** [2.6.2, 4.13)

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* {[CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)}

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** not calculated.

**Summary:**

In Eclipse BIRT, starting from version 2.6.2, the default configuration allowed to retrieve a report from the same host using an absolute HTTP path for the report parameter (e.g. `__report=http://xyz.com/report.rptdesign`). If the host indicated in the `__report` parameter matched the HTTP Host header value, the report would be retrieved. However, the Host header can be tampered with on some configurations where no virtual hosts are put in place (e.g. in the default configuration of Apache Tomcat) or when the default host points to the BIRT server.

This vulnerability was patched on Eclipse BIRT 4.13.

**Links:**

* <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=580391>

## Tracking

**This section will completed by the project team**.

* We're ready for this issue to be reported to the central authority (i.e., make this public now)
* (when applicable) The GitHub Security Advisory is ready to be published now

Note that for those projects that host their repositories on GitHub, the use of GitHub Security Advisories is recommended but is not required.

**This section will be completed by the EMO**.

**CVE:** {cve}

* All required information is provided
* CVE Assigned
* Pushed to Mitre
* Accepted by Mitre

BIRT enables you to retrieve a report from another host using an absolute http path for the report parameter: `__report=http://xyz.com/report.rptdesign`. This means that you can host report designs on one server and the ReportViewer web application on another.  e.g. `https://reportserver.mydomain.com:8080/birt/frameset?__report=http://otherdomain:8090/birt/test.rptdesign`  I some cases this would allow attackers to prepare reports that could execute malicious code on the host of the ReportViewer web application.  A full description of the CVE is here: <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=580391>  The PR for the fix is here: [#1165](https://github.com/eclipse-birt/birt/pull/1165) |
