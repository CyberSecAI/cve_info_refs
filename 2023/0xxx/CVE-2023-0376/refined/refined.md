- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page/post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed when a user views the affected page/post. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a crafted CSS class to the "Post Grid" Gutenberg block
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs at least a Contributor role to be able to inject the malicious payload.
