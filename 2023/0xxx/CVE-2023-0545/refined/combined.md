## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Hostel < 1.1.5.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Manage Rooms and click on "Click here to add room".
2. Update the Room title field as "autofocus onfocus=alert(1)//
3. Go back and select edit the Room that you have created and to trigger the XSS.
