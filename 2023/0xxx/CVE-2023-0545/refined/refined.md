- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the "Room title" field when adding or editing rooms, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages within the WordPress admin panel. This can lead to various malicious actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Room title" field when adding or editing rooms in the plugin's admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or other high-privilege roles) on the WordPress site.
