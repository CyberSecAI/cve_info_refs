- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate if the content to be loaded via shortcodes is actually a campaign, allowing access to arbitrary post content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary post content disclosure, including draft, private or password-protected posts can be accessed by any authenticated user like a subscriber.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific POST request with a shortcode to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, an attacker can access the content of arbitrary posts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber level privileges.
