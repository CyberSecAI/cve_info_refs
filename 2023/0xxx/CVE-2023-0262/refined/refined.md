Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The core issue is a SQL injection vulnerability, which is caused by the lack of input sanitization before the parameter is used in the SQL statement.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify database content, or potentially gain further access to the system.
    *   The provided proof of concept shows a time-based blind SQL injection, which can be used to extract data from the database.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically using a crafted POST request containing a malicious shortcode parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker only needs to be a subscriber or higher user role on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability. This is a low privilege level, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
    *   The attacker can execute the exploit through a browser, by crafting a specific request.

*   **Additional Details:**
    * The vulnerable plugin is "WP Airbnb Review Slider" version before 3.3.
    * The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 and A1: Injection in the OWASP top 10.
    * The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.7 (High).
    * A proof-of-concept is provided to demonstrate the exploitation of the vulnerability.
