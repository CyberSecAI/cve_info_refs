- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them, leading to the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page or post. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By embedding crafted shortcodes with malicious attributes, such as `[tr_tabs id='"); alert(1); ("']` or `[tr_tabs id='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"']`, into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges to create or edit posts and embed the malicious shortcodes.
