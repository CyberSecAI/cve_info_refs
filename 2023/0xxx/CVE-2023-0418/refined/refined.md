- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected page/post, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with specially crafted attributes and embedding it into a WordPress page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" role privileges to create or edit posts/pages with the vulnerable shortcode.
