- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate if the template loaded via a shortcode is actually a template. This allows an attacker to load arbitrary posts via the `oceanwp_library` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control. The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control and lack of validation in the shortcode functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An authenticated user (subscriber role or higher) can access the content of any post, including draft, private, or password-protected posts. This results in unauthorized information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, using the `parse-media-shortcode` action along with the vulnerable `oceanwp_library` shortcode, and providing the ID of the post they wish to access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least the subscriber role. They also need the OceanWP theme to be installed and active on the target website.
