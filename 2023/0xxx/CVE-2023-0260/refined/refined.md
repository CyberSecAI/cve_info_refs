- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious `shortcode` parameter within the `body`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to have a user account on the WordPress site with at least a subscriber role.
