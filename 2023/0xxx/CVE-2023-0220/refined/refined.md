- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate and escape a shortcode attribute before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user (Subscriber or higher) can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database. In the provided PoC, user login information is extracted.
- **Attack vectors**:  By crafting a malicious shortcode with SQL injection payloads within the `lang` attribute of the `dopbs` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "subscriber" level privileges in WordPress. The attack is performed via HTTP POST request to `admin-ajax.php`.
