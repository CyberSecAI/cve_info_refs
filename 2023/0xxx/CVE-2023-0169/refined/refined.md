- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zoho Forms plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views the page/post, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting a crafted shortcode with malicious JavaScript into a WordPress post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor level access to WordPress to create or modify posts/pages.
