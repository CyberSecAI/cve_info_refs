Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The "Easy Affiliate Links" WordPress plugin fails to properly validate and escape certain block options before displaying them on a page or post where the block is embedded. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through these options.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate user-provided input for block options.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The plugin does not properly encode the block options before outputting them in the HTML, leading to potential execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a page/post with the malicious block options. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing of cookies or sensitive information
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Gutenberg Block Option:** The specific attack vector is via the "Additional CSS class(es)" option for the "Easy Affiliate Link" Gutenberg block.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into this block option. For example:
    `" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Contributor+ Role:** The attacker needs to have at least the "Contributor" role within the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages containing the vulnerable block.
*   **Ability to add/modify blocks:** Attacker needs to have the rights to use the Gutenberg block editor and modify the specific block option.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7.1 of the plugin.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject the malicious code.
*   The CVE is classified under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
*   The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium), indicating a significant risk.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lana Codes.
