## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Affiliate Links < 3.7.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embedded, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Exploit Additional CSS class(es) for "Easy Affiliate Link" Gutenberg block:
" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"
Note: First, you need to add an Affiliate Link.
