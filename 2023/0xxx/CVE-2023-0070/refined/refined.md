- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious shortcode attributes (specifically the `voice` attribute of the `responsivevoice_button` shortcode) and embedding this shortcode into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role privileges to create or edit content where the vulnerable shortcode can be added.
