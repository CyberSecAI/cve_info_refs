- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious activities such as data theft, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript into the shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site to be able to add or edit content with shortcodes.
