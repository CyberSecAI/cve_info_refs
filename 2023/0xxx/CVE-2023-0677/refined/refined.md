  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2023-0677",
      "root_cause": "The application was not properly sanitizing email addresses before displaying them in an error message. Specifically, the code was directly outputting unsanitized email addresses within the error message when an invalid email format was detected.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Insufficient Output Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the email address field, which would then be executed in the victim's browser when the error message is displayed. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker provides a crafted string containing malicious JavaScript in place of a valid email address through the web form.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and submit data to the vulnerable forms."
