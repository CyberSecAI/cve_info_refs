- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GoToWP plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page/post. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with a JavaScript payload within the attributes, and adding it to a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a "contributor" role on the WordPress website to be able to create or edit posts/pages and insert malicious shortcodes.
