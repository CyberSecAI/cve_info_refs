## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ExactMetrics < 7.12.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add a "Popular Posts" block and put the following payload in the "Additional CSS class(es)" block advanced option:
" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;"
