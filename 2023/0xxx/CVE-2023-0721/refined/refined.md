Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-0721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of formula elements within exported CSV files. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize data properly before exporting it to a CSV format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape special characters that, when opened in spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets, can be interpreted as formulas rather than plain text.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerable code

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By injecting malicious formulas into CSV data, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on a user's local system when the user downloads and opens the manipulated CSV file using spreadsheet software with a vulnerable configuration.
*  **Data exfiltration/manipulation:** Malicious formulas could be constructed to exfiltrate data from the spreadsheet or manipulate data within it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerable code via the affected endpoint and inject the malicious code.
*   The attack is triggered by exporting form entry data, as a CSV file, from a vulnerable instance of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs no authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to create form entries that will then be exported, and therefore needs the plugin to be present on the target WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin versions up to, and including 3.3.0.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.3.1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher from Wordfence.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `export.php` file.
*   The fix includes sanitizing the header row and sanitizing the data to prevent CSV injection attacks. It also adds sanitization to prevent directory traversal.
*   The fix also includes HTML sanitization in `base/shortcode.php` to prevent XSS.
*   The provided files show that the plugin sanitizes headers and data to prevent CSV injection, specifically by using `htmlspecialchars`, and also by sanitizing filenames. Also, single quotes are prepended to strings that begin with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` to prevent formulas from being executed.
