Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a vulnerability related to the sanitization of special characters in the 'action' GET parameter within the Ampache application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The application was not properly sanitizing the 'action' GET parameter, which could potentially allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection-based attacks.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`action` GET parameter).
    - The code was using `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` in some places which is not appropriate for sanitizing for HTML context, and could lead to XSS
    - There were inconsistent uses of sanitization functions across different files.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  An attacker could inject malicious code, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    -  This could allow the attacker to steal cookies or session information, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions within the context of the vulnerable user's session.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The primary attack vector is through the `action` GET parameter in the HTTP request.
    - An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing malicious code in the `action` parameter, then trick a user to click on the link.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable `action` parameter.
    -  The attacker could be an external party or an internal attacker who can manipulate HTTP requests or trick users into clicking a malicious link.

**Details from the commit:**
The commit modifies the following files to address the vulnerability:

-   `public/templates/show_alphabet_form.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_browse.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_highest.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_mashup.inc.php`
-  `public/templates/show_form_newest.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_popular.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_recent.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_form_userflag.inc.php`
-   `public/templates/show_graphs.inc.php`
-   `src/Module/Application/ApplicationRunner.php`
-   `src/Module/Application/Playback/PlayAction.php`

The changes replace `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` in several templates and introduces `htmlspecialchars()` on the action name in `ApplicationRunner.php`. These changes aim to sanitize the `action` parameter to prevent XSS. Additionally, the commit adds `true, 303` to the header redirect calls in PlayAction.php.

This commit provides more details than a typical CVE description, showing the specific files changed and the nature of the sanitization fixes.
