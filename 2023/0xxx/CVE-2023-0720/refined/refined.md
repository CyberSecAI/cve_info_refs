Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-0720

**Description:** The `Wicked Folders` plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the `ajax_save_folder_order` function in versions up to and including 2.18.16. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions (or higher) to invoke this function and perform actions intended for administrators, such as modifying the plugin's folder structure.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a capability check within the `ajax_save_folder_order` function. This means that the function can be accessed and executed by any authenticated user regardless of their assigned role or permissions within WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authorization Check: The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check on the `ajax_save_folder_order` function.
- Authorization Bypass: As a consequence of the missing check, lower-privileged users can bypass intended authorization restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Modification: Attackers can modify the plugin's folder structure, including changing the order of folders.
- Potential Data Corruption: Modifying the folder structure could lead to data corruption or incorrect organization of the site's content.
- Privilege Escalation: Though not direct, this could be considered a form of privilege escalation because users are allowed to perform actions that are typically reserved for administrator users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Attack: The attack is initiated via the network via an AJAX request.
- Authenticated User: Requires a valid user account on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User:  The attacker needs to have a user account with at least subscriber-level permissions on the WordPress site.
- Network Access:  The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site and the ability to send a crafted AJAX request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 2.18.17 of the plugin. The fix adds a capability check to the ajax_save_folder_order function as well as other ajax actions to prevent unauthorized access.
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.4.
