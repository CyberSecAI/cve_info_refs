- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the website, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing session cookies, or performing other unwanted actions on behalf of a user.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with XSS payload, and using that in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires at least a Contributor role or above to be able to add posts or pages that can include the crafted shortcode.
