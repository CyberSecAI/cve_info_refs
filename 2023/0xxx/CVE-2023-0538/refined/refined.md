- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize shortcode attributes such as `wrapper`, `wrapper-inline-style`, `form-inline-style`, `input-class`, `form` and `custom_parameters`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page/post. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with XSS payloads in the vulnerable attributes and embedding it in a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role or higher on the WordPress site. They also need to activate the shortcode via the plugin's settings and set a bitly API key (even a dummy one) in the advanced settings.
