Based on the provided content, the commit `46c13a4b7f675b92d297df6dabb4441f13c7cd9c` introduces a fix for a security issue by implementing a `DefaultGetRequestSkipper` in the `middleware.SecureWithConfig`. This commit also includes some other changes like adding an activity table to the database, updating version information, and minor UI changes.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit addresses a missing security configuration related to the `middleware.Secure` in the `echo` framework. Specifically, it seems the security middleware was not correctly configured to skip GET requests, which could expose the application to certain vulnerabilities when specific headers were not set on GET requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Security Headers on GET requests:** Without a specific skipper for GET requests, `middleware.Secure` would potentially enforce security headers on them, which could be problematic for static resources or public APIs. The commit adds the `DefaultGetRequestSkipper` to avoid this.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The provided content does not specify the exact vulnerability being mitigated by adding the `DefaultGetRequestSkipper`. However, without proper security headers on GET requests, a potential attack could be:
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) :** Improperly configured or missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and XSS protection headers could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
* **Clickjacking:** If the `X-Frame-Options` header is not set or is not set correctly, the application may be vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
* **MIME-Sniffing:** If the `X-Content-Type-Options` header is not set, browsers might misinterpret the content type, potentially leading to security issues.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker could exploit the lack of security headers on GET requests by crafting malicious URLs or by performing man-in-the-middle attacks to modify HTTP responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept and modify requests or craft malicious ones.

**Additional Notes:**
* The commit adds a `DefaultGetRequestSkipper` which skips security headers for `GET` requests to address the issue with the `middleware.Secure`. This fix seems to be focused on preventing issues with static resources and public endpoints, not with a specific CVE.
* This commit also includes several other changes, including database schema changes (adding an `activity` table), version updates and minor UI changes which are not directly related to the security fix.

In summary, this commit aims to address a configuration issue in the server's middleware that was exposing it to potential vulnerabilities due to missing security headers on GET requests. The fix involves introducing a skipper that excludes GET requests from being checked by the security middleware.
