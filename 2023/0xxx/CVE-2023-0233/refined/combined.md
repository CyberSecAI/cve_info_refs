## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ActiveCampaign < 8.1.12 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add a "AC Forms" Gutenberg block to a post dn put the following payload in the "Additional CSS class(es)" advanced settings of the block:
" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)" style="background:red;width:100px;height:100px;"
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/previewing the post and moving the mouse over the red block
Note: There is no need to connect Active Campaign to confirm the exploit.
