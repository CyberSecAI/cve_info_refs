- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly validate and escape post meta data before displaying it on a page/post. Specifically, the "city" meta field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which could lead to various actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by adding an event with a malicious city meta value (e.g., `onmouseover="alert(1)"`). Then, when the shortcode `[event-list]` is used to display the event, hovering over the displayed content triggers the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access on the WordPress site to add/edit events with malicious meta values. The attacker does not need any special network access; this is a web-based attack.
