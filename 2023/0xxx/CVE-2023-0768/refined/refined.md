- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before using them in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input used in SQL queries. Specifically, shortcode attributes within the `Calendario_Avirato` shortcode are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful SQL Injection attack can allow an attacker to potentially extract sensitive data from the database or modify data within the database. In this case, the provided proof-of-concept (PoC) extracts the user login names from the `wp_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (Subscriber or higher role) by crafting malicious shortcode attributes and inserting the vulnerable shortcode in a post or by sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with a role of subscriber or higher on the vulnerable WordPress site. They must also have the capability to create or edit posts or send POST requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
