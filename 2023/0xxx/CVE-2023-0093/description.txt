Okta Advanced Server Access Client versions 1.13.1 through 1.65.0 are vulnerable to command injection due to the third party library webbrowser. An outdated library, webbrowser, used by the ASA client was found to be vulnerable to command injection. To exploit this issue, an attacker would need to phish the user to enter an attacker controlled server URL during enrollment.
