The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0043.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin `custom-add-user` does not sanitize or escape a parameter before outputting it back on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the browser of a user, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. This is particularly dangerous if the victim is an administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user, especially an admin, into opening a specially crafted link or HTML page. The crafted input, injected through the `dmsg` parameter, gets reflected back in the context of the vulnerable page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to visit a malicious URL. The attack requires user interaction. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileged access to initiate the attack. The attacker crafts the malicious input and redirects a user to the vulnerable page.
