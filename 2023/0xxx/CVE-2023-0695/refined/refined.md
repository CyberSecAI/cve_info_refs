Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `mf` shortcode in the Metform plugin, which echoes unescaped form submissions. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- Lack of sanitization of form submission data when rendering it through the `mf` shortcode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a WordPress page.
- When a user visits the crafted link, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- This can lead to a range of consequences, including but not limited to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can submit a crafted form containing malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker then uses the `mf` shortcode to display the submitted data on a page.
- The victim has to visit a specific URL containing the vulnerable shortcode and the entry ID from the malicious form submission, which causes the script execution in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level permissions or above on the WordPress site to submit crafted form data
- The attacker has to craft a specific URL that includes the vulnerable shortcode as well as a parameter pointing to the entry ID of the malicious form submission.
- The victim must visit the crafted link for the malicious script to execute.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Metform plugin versions up to and including 3.3.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ram - Wordfence.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 3.3.1 of the Metform plugin and later versions.
- The `shortcode.php` file provided from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows the implementation of the shortcodes, including the vulnerable `render_mf_field` function that doesn't sanitize the output.

This vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue, with a CVSS score of 5.4.
