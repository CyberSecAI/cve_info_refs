- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape a shortcode attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website that will be executed in the browsers of other users. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the vulnerable `pdfviewer` shortcode with a crafted `height` attribute containing malicious JavaScript, a contributor user can inject the payload into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in WordPress.
