- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the page or post, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a Carousel Category with a malicious name containing JavaScript and then adding a Client Logo using the exploit category, an attacker can inject the malicious script through the shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site to create the malicious carousel category and logo.
