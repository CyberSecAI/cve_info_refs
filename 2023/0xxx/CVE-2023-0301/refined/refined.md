Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of URL schemes within the `MustacheCustomTag` class when processing Markdown links. Specifically, the code was not restricting the allowed URL schemes for links, which could allow an attacker to insert links with arbitrary protocols.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code was not enforcing restrictions on URL schemes, allowing any scheme to be used.
- **Potential for SSRF or other scheme-based attacks:** By allowing arbitrary URL schemes, attackers could potentially use schemes like `file://`, `ftp://` or `mailto:` in order to perform server side request forgery, exfiltration of local files, or send unsolicited emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Security Risks**:  The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for attackers to inject malicious links with unexpected schemes. Although the commit itself does not describe any attacks, the fact that arbitrary URL schemes could be used is a security concern. 
- **Unexpected behavior**: By injecting custom scheme URLs, an attacker may be able to cause unexpected behaviour.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Markdown Injection:** An attacker could inject specially crafted Markdown containing links with malicious schemes into input processed by `MustacheCustomTag`.
- **User-Provided Content:** If the application processes Markdown from user-provided content, such as comments or posts, it could be vulnerable to this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to inject Markdown content into an area processed by `MustacheCustomTag`.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application to craft the malicious input.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

- The fix implemented in the commit restricts the accepted schemes for absolute URLs to only "http" and "https". Any other scheme will be rejected by removing the `href` attribute from the rendered link, effectively disabling the malicious link.
- The fix also adds `target="_blank"` and `rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"` attributes to the links, which are standard security measures against certain types of attacks but may not be directly related to the scheme validation fix.
- The code uses `StringUtils.substringBefore` to extract the scheme and `Locale.ROOT` to perform case insensitive string comparison.
- The tests added in `MustacheCustomTagTest.java` verify that only http and https links are kept, all other protocols are rejected.
