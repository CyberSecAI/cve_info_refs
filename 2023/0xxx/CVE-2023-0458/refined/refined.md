Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-0458:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `getrlimit()` and related system calls in the Linux kernel are susceptible to speculative execution attacks, specifically Spectre v1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** The core issue is that the code path handling `getrlimit()` doesn't have proper mitigations against speculative execution, which allows for the possibility of leaking kernel memory.
*   **Missing Speculation Check:** Specifically, the commit addresses a missing speculation check in `do_prlimit()`, where a user-controlled resource value is added to a pointer before dereferencing it. This is a classic "gadget" that can be abused with Spectre-like attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the system to execute malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system, capable of executing code.
*  **Ability to call `getrlimit`**: The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path through a call to `getrlimit()` or a related system call.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented involves adding a speculation barrier (`array_index_nospec()`) to prevent the vulnerable code path from being used as a Spectre gadget.
*   This vulnerability affects the `do_prlimit()` function, which is responsible for getting/setting resource limits.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by adding the `array_index_nospec()` after the range check.
