Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `go-getter` library in Nomad's artifact stanza, which allows for the retrieval of custom files. A maliciously crafted compressed file (zip bomb) within an artifact source can cause excessive disk resource consumption during decompression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted decompression:** The `go-getter` library, as used by Nomad, lacked limits on the size and number of files during decompression of artifacts. This allowed for a "zip bomb" attack, where a small compressed file expands to a much larger size upon decompression, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful attack leads to excessive disk resource consumption on the Nomad client agent, causing it to crash and resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor can craft a specially crafted compressed file (zip bomb) and include it as an artifact source within a Nomad job submission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access with the `submit-job` capability within the Nomad environment.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by introducing decompression limits in the Nomad client agent configuration using `artifact.decompression_size_limit` and `artifact.decompression_file_count_limit`.
- Upgrading to Nomad versions 1.2.16, 1.3.9, 1.4.4, or newer is recommended.
