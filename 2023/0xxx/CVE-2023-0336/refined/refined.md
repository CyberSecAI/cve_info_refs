- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and broken access control vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF and broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user with a role as low as a subscriber can delete attachments.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user, even with the lowest role (subscriber) and needs to trick the user into making the malicious request.
