- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page/post. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, and performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a malicious payload into a shortcode attribute of the affected plugin, specifically within the `NEXForms` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages and embed shortcodes.
