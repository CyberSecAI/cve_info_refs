The provided content relates to CVE-2023-0335.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and broken access control issues in the WP Shamsi plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: Allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
- Broken access control: The plugin fails to properly check user roles and permissions, allowing lower-privileged users to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user with a subscriber role can delete attachments, which should be limited to higher-privileged users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with a subscriber role.
- They need to be able to send a POST request with a specific `action` and `media-ids`.
