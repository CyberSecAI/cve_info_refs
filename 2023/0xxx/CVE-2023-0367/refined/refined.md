- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious shortcode attributes and embedding the shortcode on a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site, which allows them to create and edit posts/pages where the shortcode can be used.
