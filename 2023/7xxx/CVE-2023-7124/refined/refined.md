- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The e-commerce site fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data in the `keyword` parameter of the `/ecommerce/search.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the browser of a user, potentially leading to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials and launching other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious payload, specifically within the `keyword` parameter of the `/ecommerce/search.php` URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload and entice a user to visit it or inject the malicious code into a site.
