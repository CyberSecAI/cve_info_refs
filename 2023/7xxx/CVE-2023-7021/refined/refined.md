Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$VU_ID`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the `$VU_ID` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The vulnerable code constructs the SQL query by directly concatenating the unsanitized user input, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, attackers could gain elevated privileges within the database system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the normal operations of the application by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `$VU_ID` parameter of the HTTP request sent to the vulnerable `delete_search.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must identify the `$VU_ID` parameter as the entry point for SQL injection.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File:** `general/vehicle/checkup/delete_search.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `$VU_ID`
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** Tongda OA <=v11.10 and =v2017
*   **Bypass:** The vulnerability leverages the fact that the parentheses are closed, allowing for a bypass.
*   **Injection Type:** The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using a Cartesian product.
*   **Example Payload:**
    ```sql
    1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)%20and(1)=(1
    ```
    This payload is used to determine if the first character of the database name is 't'. If the response is delayed (time-based), it indicates a successful injection and the character is correct.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and includes a practical example payload, which is more informative than a basic CVE description.
* The provided images of the response delay highlight the time-based nature of the injection.
