- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly uses the `student` parameter from a POST request in an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The lack of input validation allows for malicious SQL code to be injected through the 'student' parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read, modify or delete sensitive data from the database, or even gain full control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `/libsystem/admin/return_add.php` with a crafted `student` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. They don't need prior access to the application or any specific privileges.
