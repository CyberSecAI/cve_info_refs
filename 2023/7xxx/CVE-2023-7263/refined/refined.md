- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The log uploading function of Huawei home music system products does not properly validate the file names reported by the ceiling speaker, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient file name validation during log uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized file deletion or modification of file permissions on the music host system, potentially causing system function exceptions.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can intercept or forge log upload packets and inject malicious file names to trigger the path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to intercept or forge network packets sent to the Huawei home music system. This suggests a position on the local network (AV:A) and a low level of privilege (PR:L) are needed.
