- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication due to the manipulation of the `X-Token` argument in the `/index.php?c=api` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication (CWE-287).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows remote attackers to bypass authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all rated as low.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote with no special privileges and requires no user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
