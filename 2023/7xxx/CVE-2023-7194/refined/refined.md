- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Meris theme fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied parameters before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim user, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on their behalf, especially if the victim is a high-privilege user like an admin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=meris_widget_area_generator` with malicious values in the `areaname` and `num` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious POST request. The victim needs to be tricked into submitting the form (likely through social engineering).
