- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin accepts all zip files and extracts them into a publicly accessible directory without sufficiently validating the extracted file types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution by uploading and executing malicious files.
- **Attack vectors:**  Uploading a specially crafted zip file containing an executable file like a `.shtml` file. The file is extracted to a publicly accessible directory, and by directly accessing the file through a web browser, the attacker can trigger the execution of the malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on a WordPress multisite instance. The server also needs to have `mod_include` and `mod_cgi` enabled with server-side includes configured.
