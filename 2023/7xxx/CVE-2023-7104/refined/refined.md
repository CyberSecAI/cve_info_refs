Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7104:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the SQLite sessions extension, specifically within the `sessionReadRecord` function, when processing a corrupt changeset.
- The issue arises from the lack of validation of `pIn->iNext` before reading from `pIn->aData`. Specifically, when the `eType` is `SQLITE_INTEGER` or `SQLITE_FLOAT`, the code attempts to read 8 bytes from `pIn->aData[pIn->iNext]` without ensuring that at least 8 bytes are available. This can result in out-of-bounds read when `pIn->iNext` is close to `pIn->nData`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `sessionGetI64` function when the input data is crafted such that `pIn->iNext` is too close to `pIn->nData`.
- Lack of input validation: The code does not validate if enough data is available for the 8-byte read when processing `SQLITE_INTEGER` or `SQLITE_FLOAT` types, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: Due to memory corruption, sensitive data can be read from the heap.
- Addition or modification of data: It's implied that the memory corruption could potentially lead to the attacker gaining some control and potentially modifying data although it's not explicitly stated.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- The Fedora update also mentions "heap corruption via a crafted HTML page" which suggests that this could be triggered through a browser, and cause the renderer process to be compromised

**Attack vectors:**
- Corrupt changeset: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted, corrupt changeset within the SQLite sessions extension.
- Crafted HTML page: The Fedora update suggests this can be exploited via a crafted HTML page, likely due to Chromium using a vulnerable version of SQLite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a corrupt changeset to SQLite.
- For the browser context, the attacker needs to be able to get the victim to load a crafted HTML page

**Additional Notes:**
- NetApp is tracking this vulnerability under the advisory ID NTAP-20240112-0008, indicating that multiple of their products incorporate vulnerable versions of SQLite.
- A patch has been identified and implemented in SQLite, adding the necessary input validation: `if( (pIn->nData-pIn->iNext)<8 )`.
- The vulnerability is present in SQLite versions up to 3.43.0, as stated in the NetApp advisory.
- The fix was introduced with commit [0e4e7a05] and was backported to the branch-3.43 branch.
- The vulnerability was discovered using a custom tool and Address Sanitizer.
- The issue is located in `sqlite3.c:220260:11` in the function `sessionGetI64`.
- The provided ASAN report confirms a heap-buffer-overflow.
- While the SQLite developers don't participate in the CVE system, they do not try to stop others from issuing CVEs for issues found in their software.

The provided information gives a good explanation of the vulnerability and its root cause, and it highlights the different ways it can be exploited depending on the context where the SQLite is used.
