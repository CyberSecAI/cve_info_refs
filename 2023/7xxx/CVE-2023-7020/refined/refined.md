- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly incorporates the `$TEMP_ID` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, and other unauthorized access. In this specific example the attacker is using blind injection to leak the database name.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the `general/wiki/cp/ct/view.php` endpoint, manipulating the `$TEMP_ID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
