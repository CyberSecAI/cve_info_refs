{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the 'mobilenumber' parameter on the server-side during user profile updates, allowing modification through request interception.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Parameter tampering vulnerability due to lack of server-side validation of the 'mobilenumber' parameter during user profile updates.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify a user's contact number, potentially leading to impersonation, social engineering, or unauthorized access to sensitive data associated with the modified contact information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through intercepting and modifying the HTTP request sent when updating a user's profile. Specifically, the attacker manipulates the 'mobilenumber' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Online Notes Sharing System. They also need the ability to intercept HTTP requests, which can be achieved using tools like Burp Suite or browser developer tools."
