Release DateJanuary 11, 2024
Alert CodeICSA-24-011-04

**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 7.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Low attack complexity
* **Vendor**: Horner Automation
* **Equipment**: Cscape
* **Vulnerability**: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Horner Automation products are affected:

* Cscape: Versions 9.90 SP10 and prior

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

**3.2.1 [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**

In Horner Automation Cscape versions 9.90 SP10 and prior, local attackers are able to exploit this vulnerability if a user opens a malicious CSP file, which would result in execution of arbitrary code on affected installations of Cscape.

[CVE-2023-7206](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-7206) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Michael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Horner Automation recommends users to apply [v9.90 SP11](https://hornerautomation.com/cscape-software/) or the latest version of their software.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

### **What version of Cscape do I need?**

• Cscape 10 is a major new release that offers a variety of significant enhancements to the User Interface, Logic and Screen development.  These advancements can be realized by any OCS user utilizing any current Horner OCS platform.

• In addition – Cscape 10 contains a large number exclusive features for the new Canvas line of All-in-one Controllers.  This is especially true as it relates to the Canvas Advanced Graphics engine – where a number of screen development tools and graphics objects have been reimagined from the ground up.

• For Canvas users, Cscape 10 is required.  We invite non-Canvas OCS users to transition to Cscape 10 on their desired schedule – proceeding as is customary with any major software release prior to its deployment in the field.

• For some time, both versions (Cscape 9.9 and Cscape 10) will be available as current releases on the Horner Automation web site.  This will allow customers the flexibility to utilize the version that best meets their needs during this transition period.
