```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled `page` parameter from the GET request without sufficient sanitization, which leads to arbitrary file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsanitized user input, Arbitrary File Inclusion",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file through the vulnerable `page` parameter, potentially leading to full server compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request with a crafted `page` parameter. The attacker can use path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and needs to have access to a malicious php file on the server to include."
