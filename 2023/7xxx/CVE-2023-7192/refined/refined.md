  "CVE-2023-7192": {
    "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel via the nft_pipapo_walk function. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to trigger an application crash, information disclosure, or local privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a refcount leak in the `ctnetlink_create_conntrack()` function within the netfilter subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource management",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can trigger an application crash, information disclosure, or local privilege escalation due to double deactivations of PIPAPO elements, leading to a use-after-free.",
     "attack_vectors": [
         "Local access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability on the local system.",
    "more_information": "The function `nft_pipapo_walk` did not skip inactive elements during set walk which could lead to double deactivations of PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-after-free.\nFix was introduced by commit 317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a. The fix in `net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c` calls `nf_ct_put` to release the refcount."
