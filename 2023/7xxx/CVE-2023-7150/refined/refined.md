The provided content relates to CVE-2023-7150.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the original name of the uploaded file without checking the file type.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The application does not validate the file type or extension of the uploaded file, allowing arbitrary files, including malicious ones to be uploaded to the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can upload and execute malicious code (e.g., PHP scripts), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `add-product.php` form that is present in the Chic Beauty Salon System, specifically, the `image` upload field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the `add-product.php` form which is likely part of an admin interface, so they need some level of access or be able to bypass authentication. They need to be able to send crafted HTTP requests.
