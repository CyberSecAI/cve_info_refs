Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability present in the dynamic domain name system (DDNS) settings of SystemK NVR devices. This vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in a command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**- The software fails to neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This means an attacker could gain complete control over the vulnerable NVR device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The attack has low complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
