- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied parameters before outputting them back into the page. Specifically, the `formtype` parameter in the `evors_get_rsvp_form` AJAX action is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that is viewed by a user with high privileges, like an admin. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions with the privileges of the user such as accessing sensitive information or further compromising the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTML page with a form that targets the vulnerable AJAX endpoint `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable `formtype` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user, particularly an admin, into opening a malicious page. The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable parameters and the AJAX action being used.
