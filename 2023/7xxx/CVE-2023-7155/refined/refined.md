The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in an inventory management system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly constructs SQL queries using unfiltered user-supplied input, specifically within the `$obj->update()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, stemming from a failure to sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Data manipulation/modification
    *   Denial of service via database overload.
    *   Complete database compromise if the user has sufficient permissions

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP POST requests to `edit_product.php`.
*   **Vulnerable parameters:** The `id`, `product_name`, `brand` and likely other fields in the POST request are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges are explicitly stated for the exploitation, but the attacker would need access to the application to make the vulnerable requests.
