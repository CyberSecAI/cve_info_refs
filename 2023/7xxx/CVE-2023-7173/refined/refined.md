{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization on the 'Fullname' parameter within the user registration form, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	  "Insufficient Input Validation",
	  "Lack of Output Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's database, which can be executed when other users view the infected page. This can lead to:\n\n- Patient data exposure through potential theft of sensitive information, such as patient details for identity theft or fraud.\n- Patient safety risks by allowing unauthorized changes in patient records, which could jeopardize patient care.\n- Unauthorized actions by an attacker who can execute actions on behalf of users, gaining unauthorized access and misusing resources.\n- Erosion of trust in the healthcare facility due to the breach.\n- Violations of data protection regulations, leading to fines and legal consequences.\n- Disruption of healthcare services, potentially causing prescription errors and misdiagnoses.\n- Legal and ethical implications for harm caused and ethical concerns about patient privacy.\n- Financial consequences due to remediation efforts, system upgrades, and legal costs.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload through the 'Fullname' field in the user registration form. The payload is then stored in the database and executed in the browser of a user who views the infected page. Specifically, the login page is identified as vulnerable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the user registration form and input a malicious payload into the 'Fullname' field, and complete other registration fields with valid data. They would also require an understanding of how to craft a successful XSS payload and an account on the system."
