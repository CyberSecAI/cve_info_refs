The provided content is related to CVE-2023-7127.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the "Automated Voting System 1.0". The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via the 'idno' parameter when handling login requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input passed through the `idno` parameter in the login form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Compromise of the application: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application's underlying database.
- Data access: Attackers could read sensitive information from the database.
- Data modification: Attackers can modify the database potentially altering application's data.
- Exploitation of database vulnerabilities: Attackers could leverage the database's vulnerabilities to further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page of the application.
- `idno` parameter: The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `idno` parameter in the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require any prior knowledge of the database structure to exploit this vulnerability using tools like SQLMap.
