The provided content describes an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Automad CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application allows uploading files with dangerous types (SVG, PDF) and does not validate the content type. It only checks the file extension against a predefined list of allowed extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading files with potentially malicious content.
- Lack of content type validation: The application does not validate the content of uploaded files, relying only on the file extension.
- Insecure file type allowlist: The default allowlist includes file types like SVG and PDF, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stored XSS: By uploading malicious SVG or PDF files, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the uploaded file.
- Potential for further attacks: The ability to execute arbitrary code can lead to more severe consequences, such as session hijacking, data theft, or even complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload functionality: The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload mechanism in the application.
- Malicious file crafted with embedded javascript: The attacker crafts a malicious SVG or PDF file with embedded javascript code that will be executed upon access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the application. This likely requires authentication and authorization to access the file upload feature.
