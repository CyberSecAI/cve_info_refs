The provided content details a **Blind SSRF** vulnerability in the Automad CMS.

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `FileController.php` file's `import` function not validating the `importUrl` parameter, allowing arbitrary URLs to be used in the import process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input validation on the `importUrl` parameter within the `FileController.php`'s `import` function.
- The `importUrl` parameter is directly used in a request by the `FileModel::import` function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Blind SSRF:** An attacker can make the server initiate requests to arbitrary URLs.
- **Port scanning:** An attacker can scan internal ports of the server or internal network.
- **Abuse internal services:** The attacker can potentially interact with services running on internal networks that are accessible by the server but not directly from the outside.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `POST /dashboard?controller=File::import` endpoint.
- The attacker crafts a POST request with the vulnerable parameters `url` and `importUrl`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the dashboard and the file import feature.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
