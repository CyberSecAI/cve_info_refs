- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize uploaded SVG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the SVG file, which will be executed in the victim's browser when the SVG is accessed directly, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript using the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least "Author" level privileges in the WordPress instance to upload files.
