Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `width` and `height` parameters in the MapPress plugin's map settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before storing it in the database or displaying it on web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page. When a user views that page, the malicious script will execute in their browser.
- This allows for potential malicious actions such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `width` and `height` parameters within the map settings of the MapPress plugin.
- An attacker would input a malicious script as the value for width or height when creating or editing a map using the plugin.
- The malicious script is stored in the WordPress database along with the map settings.
- When a page displaying the map is loaded, the stored malicious script is output to the page and executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the target WordPress site with at least "contributor" level access. This is because they need to be able to access the plugin settings page and create or edit maps.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in MapPress plugin versions up to and including 2.88.16.
- The vulnerable parameters are "width" and "height".
- The fix was implemented in version 2.88.17, which includes better parsing of width/height values to prevent script injection.
- A sample payload provided is `'><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>` which demonstrates a simple XSS vulnerability
