### Description

The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the width and height parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.88.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

# CVE-2023-7225 — MapPress WP Plugin <= 2.88.16 Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scritpting

  Jan 29, 2024   Jan 29, 2024  abay

The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the width and height parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.88.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the width and height parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.88.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### Proof of Concepts

1. Go to Plugin’s page `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mappress_maps`
2. Add New Map and search any location you want.
3. Add XSS Payload on Map Settings on width or height column `'><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`
4. Save Maps
5. Copy your created Maps’ shortcode then paste in a new post

XSS Payload will triggered in the created page.

### Impact

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
