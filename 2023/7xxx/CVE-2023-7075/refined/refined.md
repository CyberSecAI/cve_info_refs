- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a reflective XSS vulnerability present in the `checkout.php` file of the Point of Sales and Inventory Management System. The application does not sanitize user inputs when displaying them on the checkout page, specifically within an input tag on line 103 of `PISP/main/checkout.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input field. This allows attackers to steal administrator cookies, perform actions on behalf of the administrator, and potentially gain full control of the application and associated systems, including the ability to fake administrator logins.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload within the `pt` parameter. When a user (or an administrator) accesses the crafted URL, the script executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user, or an administrator, into accessing the URL. This can be achieved via phishing or other social engineering tactics.
