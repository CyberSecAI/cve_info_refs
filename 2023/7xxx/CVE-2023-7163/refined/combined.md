* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.

# D-Link D-View 8 Unauthenticated Probe-Core Server Communication

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A security issue exists in D-Link D-View 8 v2.0.2.89 and prior that could allow an attacker to manipulate the probe inventory of the D-View service. This could result in the disclosure of info

An unauthenticated remote attacker can register a host of his/her choice as a Probe server by sending a 'probe-online' task to the Core server. The attacker can create many bogus, attacker-controlled Probe servers on the Core server, polluting the D-View 8 web UI and the underlying MongoDB collection DView8\_Probe. If an attacker-controlled Probe server is used (i.e., for network discovery) by D-View 8 users, bogus device information can be sent to and stored on the Core server.

A 'probe-online' task is sent by a Probe server to the Core server periodically (i.e., every minute) to indicate its online status. The ID (probeId) of the Probe server is included in the task.

In addition, the attacker can fetch tasks destinated to existing, legitimate Probe servers. D-View 8 tasks are stored in the DView8\_Task MongoDB collection. A Probe server periodically (i.e., every 10 seconds) fetches (from the Core server) a task destinated to it with matching criteria like probeId, taskStatus (i.e., 8) and time (i.e., task updated within the last 15 minutes). If the attacker knows the probeId of a legitimate Probe server, s/he can fetch a task for the legitimate Probe before it does by fetching more frequently (i.e., every 2 seconds). It does so by sending a 'request\_task' task to the Core server with the probeId of the legitimate Probe server in it.

The probeId used in D-View 8 is in the form of probe-<mac-address> (i.e., probe-11-22-33-44-55-66) if the Probe server is on a different host than the Core server. If the Probe server and the Core server are on the same host, the probeId is in the form of LocalProbe-<mac-address> (i.e., LocalProbe-11-22-33-44-55-66). An attacker on the same LAN as a legitimate Probe server can determine its probeId as the attacker can learn about the Probe server's MAC address via ARP.

D-View 8 tasks can contain sensitive information such as login credentials. For example, an 'add-discovery' task can contain SNMP and WMI credentials  used for scanning network devices. This task is initiated when a user logged into the D-View 8 Web server performs a manual network discovery or when a schedule (i.e., daily) to perform network discovery is run. The task is sent to a Probe server asking it to scan for network devices so that they can be managed by D-View 8.

Another task containing credentials is 'tool-cli'. This task is initiated when a user logged into the D-View 8 Web server tries to connect (i.e., SSH) to a discovered device. The login (i.e., SSH) credentials to the device is present in the task and thus the attacker would be able to grab that.

If the attacker fetches a task before the legitimate Probe server does, the task is not performed by the legitimate Probe server because the taskStatus has been updated after the fetch, resulting in a denial-of-service.

PoC:

```
//
// Fetch tasks for an existing, legitimate Probe server
//
// User may need to initiate the 'tool-cli' and/or 'add-discovery'
// task multiple times for the PoC to see those tasks as it competes
// with a legitimate Probe server.
//
// The probeId should be probe-<mac-address> where <mac-address> is the
// MAC address of the Probe server set up above.
// i.e., probe-11-22-33-44-55-66
