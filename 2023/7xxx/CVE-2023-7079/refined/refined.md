Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-7079:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Wrangler dev server's behavior of serving files beyond the intended scope of the project bundle. It was found that by sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages, it was possible to access any file on the user's computer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability was the ability to read arbitrary files from the user's local machine via the development server. This was due to insufficient restrictions on the files accessible via the dev server.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:**  The Wrangler development server, by default, listened on all interfaces (`*`), making it accessible from the local network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the developer's machine, including source code, credentials, personal information, and other files.
- **Local Network Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user on the local network into visiting a malicious website, enabling them to read files from the developer's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attacks:** An attacker on the same local network as the developer could exploit this.
- **Malicious websites:** An attacker could trick a developer on the local network into opening a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests/Inspector Messages**: This was the method used to access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the developer running the vulnerable Wrangler dev server or have the ability to direct a user on that network to a malicious website.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests/Inspector Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to create specific requests to exploit the server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this issue was implemented in `wrangler@3.19.0`. It now only serves files that are part of the bundle or referenced by the bundle's source maps.
- A workaround involved configuring Wrangler to listen only on local interfaces (`127.0.0.1`) using `wrangler dev --ip 127.0.0.1`.
- This issue was also addressed by changing the default listening IP address in wrangler version `3.16.0`.
