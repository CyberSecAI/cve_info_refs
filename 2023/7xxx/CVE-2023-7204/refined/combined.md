## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP STAGING WordPress Backup Plugin – Migration Backup Restore < 3.2.0 - Unauthorized Sensitive Data Exposure

### Description

The plugin allows access to cache files during the cloning process which provides

unauthorized access to sensitive data

### Proof of Concept

1) When an admin creates a staging site, an attacker can capture a `.cache` file which reveals sensitive information including: DB\_name, DB\_tables, DB\_columns.
2) These files can be accessed at these URLs during backup:
- http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/clone\_options.cache
- http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/files\_to\_copy.cache
