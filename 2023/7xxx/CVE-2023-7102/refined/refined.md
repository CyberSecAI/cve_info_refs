  "CVE-2023-7102": {
    "Description": "Barracuda has filed CVE-2023-7102 in relation to Barracudaâ€™s use of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel which has been patched.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerability within a third party library, Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, was exploited by a threat actor deploying a specially crafted Excel email attachment to target a limited number of ESG devices.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseExcel due to passing unvalidated input from a file into a string-type 'eval'.",
      "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') (CWE-95)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems. Successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, and further malicious activities within the victim's network.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Specially crafted Excel (.xls and .xlsx) email attachments that, when parsed by vulnerable versions of the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel library, trigger the execution of arbitrary code. ",
      "Exploitation of a vulnerability in a module that screens attachments of incoming emails.",
        "A crafted format string within the Excel file allows the injection of commands which are then executed"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Ability to send emails with malicious attachments to a vulnerable Barracuda ESG appliance.",
        "Ability to create and deliver malicious Excel files (.xls or .xlsx) with specific formatting",
         "Knowledge of how to create a malicious format string that contains code for execution via eval"
    ],
       "Additional Information": [
            "The vulnerability is in the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel library, specifically during the parsing of Number format strings.",
             "The threat actor, tracked as UNC4841, is believed to be a China-nexus espionage group, and has shown sophistication and adaptability.",
            "Barracuda deployed a security update on December 21, 2023, to address the ACE vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseExcel.",
           "Barracuda deployed a patch on December 22, 2023, to remediate compromised ESG appliances showing indicators of compromise related to the new malware variants.",
          "The vulnerability could potentially affect any application that uses Spreadsheet::ParseExcel or a dependent library like Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX",
             "Successful exploitation leads to the deployment of additional malware such as SEASPY and SALTWATER variants."
