- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/clientdetails/admin/manage-users.php` script before using it in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can compromise the application, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially exploit further vulnerabilities in the underlying database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/clientdetails/admin/manage-users.php` with a crafted `id` parameter value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application and be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They also need to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
