Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw found in the Intern Membership Management System version 2.0. This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `userName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `gender` parameters within the `/intern/user_registration/` endpoint. The lack of input sanitization on these parameters allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to:
    *   Compromise the application.
    *   Access sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `/intern/user_registration/` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They would need to be able to modify the values of the vulnerable parameters. The attacker could use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request.

**Technical Details:**

The provided text details how to use `sqlmap` to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in the specified parameters:

*   The attacker intercepts a registration request using Burp Suite.
*   They save the intercepted request to a file (r.txt).
*   The attacker uses `sqlmap` with the `-r` option to load the request and `-p` to specify the vulnerable parameters (`userName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `gender`).
*   SQLmap is able to identify both error-based and time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities on all the parameters.
*   `sqlmap` is used to dump the database and verify successful injection.
*   The database name `db_issm` is discovered.

The content also provides example payloads to demonstrate the SQL Injection vulnerability.
