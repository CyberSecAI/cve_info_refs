The provided content describes a vulnerability in Stupid Simple CMS (Blogger) versions <= 1.2.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file renaming interface (`file-manager/rename.php`) lacks authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The `rename.php` endpoint can be accessed without any authentication checks.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The `oldName` parameter in the POST request is vulnerable to path traversal. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver has access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or user data. As demonstrated in the example, sensitive information like usernames and passwords can be exposed.
- **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read arbitrary files can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information that can be used for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `file-manager/rename.php`.
- **Path Traversal:** The `oldName` parameter is manipulated to perform path traversal using `../` sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable CMS.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication to the CMS.
