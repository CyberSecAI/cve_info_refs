Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Essential Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a custom ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the database and will be executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts via the custom ID functionality.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The injected scripts are not properly escaped when rendered on the page, causing them to be executed by the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the vulnerable pages.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By exploiting XSS, attackers can potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could deface or modify the content of the vulnerable pages.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can inject code that redirects a user to a website hosting malware

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The attack vector lies within the vulnerable code of the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   **Custom ID Input:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript via the custom ID field within the plugin's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker must be a logged-in WordPress user with at least the "Contributor" role. This role allows users to create content and therefore access the vulnerable input field.
*   **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be able to access and modify the plugin settings.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The injected script will execute automatically when a user views the affected page without any interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 5.9.2.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 5.9.3.
*   The file `Wrapper_Link.php` is involved in the vulnerability, specifically around line 65. The code changes in changeset 3013774 also seem related, where a fix was introduced to properly sanitize data.
