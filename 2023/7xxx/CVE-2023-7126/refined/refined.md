- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'username' parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the login functionality of the admin panel.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or potentially exploit other vulnerabilities within the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'username' parameter of the admin login form located at `/automated%20voting/admin/`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application, which could be done locally or remotely if the application is exposed. The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap to exploit this.
