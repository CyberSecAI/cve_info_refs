  |  | 21 | Are you facing the WordPress not sending emails issue? Don't worry! Install the Post SMTP Plugin for smooth WordPress email deliverability. |
  |  | 22 |  |
  |  | 23 | Over \*\*300,000\*\* website owners use \*\*Post SMTP\*\* daily to send WordPress emails securely and reliably💯. |
  |  | 24 |  |
  |  | 25 | Post SMTP is a free and next-generation WordPress SMTP plugin that has everything you need to improve the email deliverability of your WordPress site. |
  |  | 26 |  |
  |  | 27 | The best part is that the Post SMTP plugin helps you configure any SMTP mailer with proper authentication that guarantees the delivery of your WordPress emails and prevents them from being marked as spam. |
  |  | 28 |  |
  |  | 29 | With the [Post SMTP Pro version](https://postmansmtp.com/pricing/?utm\_source=wp\_org&utm\_medium=read\_me), you can unlock even more advanced features, such as detailed email logging, email delivery stats and reporting, Microsoft 365, Amazon SES, Zoho SMTP integration, multiple email failure alert options, and more. |
  |  | 30 |  |
  |  | 31 | == What is SMTP, and Why Do You Need It? == |
  |  | 32 | \*\*SMTP\*\*, short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is the most widely used protocol for online email transmission. SMTP configuration with proper authentication for your WordPress site ensures that your WordPress emails do not end up in spam. |
  |  | 33 |  |
  |  | 34 | \*\*By default\*\*, WordPress sends emails using the PHP mail function, which isn't ideal because most WordPress hosting servers don't support PHP email. |
  |  | 35 |  |
  |  | 36 | On top of that, most email clients, such as Outlook (Microsoft 365), Yahoo, Gmail, Zoho, etc., automatically block or mark spam emails that lack proper authentication. |
  |  | 37 |  |
  |  | 38 | That’s why you need to install the Post SMTP plugin on your WordPress site to configure the SMTP mailer of your choice. |
  |  | 39 |  |
  |  | 40 | == How Does Post SMTP Work? == |
  |  | 41 | Post SMTP allows you to easily replace the default PHP mail function (wp\_mail) of your WordPress site with the SMTP mailer of your choice, like [Microsoft 365](https://postmansmtp.com/extensions/office-365-extension-for-post-smtp/?utm\_source=wp\_org&utm\_medium=read\_me), Brevo, Zoho, Gmail, Post Mark, etc., which in turn improves WordPress email deliverability. |
  |  | 42 |  |
  |  | 43 | Additionally, with a [3-step setup wizard](https://postmansmtp.com/introducing-the-new-3-step-setup-wizard-for-post-smtp/?utm\_source=wp\_org&utm\_medium=read\_me) using OAuth (open authentication), you can configure any SMTP mailer securely via API Keys in seconds without providing your SMTP account credentials. |
  |  | 44 |  |
  |  | 45 | Ultimately, the Post SMTP helps you fix all your issues related to [WordPress not sending emails.](https://postmansmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-emails/?utm\_source=wp\_org&utm\_medium=read\_me) |

  | 297 |  | == Mail ends up in the Spam folder == |
  | 298 |  |  |
  | 299 |  | To avoid being flagged as spam, you need to prove your email isn't forged. On a custom domain, its up to YOU to set that up: |
  | 300 |  |  |
  | 301 |  | \* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record |
  | 302 |  | \* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an SPF record to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider. |
  | 303 |  | \* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature). |

### Description

The POST SMTP Mailer – Email log, Delivery Failure Notifications and Best Mail SMTP for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘device’ header in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
