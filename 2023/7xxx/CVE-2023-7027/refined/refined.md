Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7027

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'device' header within the POST SMTP Mailer plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input from the `device` header, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which is then stored in the database. This code is executed when an administrator accesses the mobile app settings page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website, leading to potential malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing sensitive information like session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the `device` header in a REST API request to the `/connect-app` endpoint, which is not properly sanitized before being stored in the database.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code is in `/Postman/Mobile/includes/rest-api/v1/rest-api.php` and `/Postman/Mobile/mobile.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to have an account on the WordPress website, they can send the malicious request directly.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the POST SMTP Mailer plugin up to and including 2.8.7.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.8.
- The vulnerable code is triggered in the mobile app functionality of the plugin.
- The specific files impacted are `Postman/Mobile/includes/rest-api/v1/rest-api.php` and `Postman/Mobile/mobile.php`.
- The fix involves sanitizing user-supplied input and escaping output to prevent XSS.
- The vulnerable code is located in `Postman/Mobile/includes/rest-api/v1/rest-api.php` around line 79 and `Postman/Mobile/mobile.php` around line 219.
