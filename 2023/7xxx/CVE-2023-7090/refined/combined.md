Package        : sudo
Version        : 1.8.27-1+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-7090 CVE-2023-28486 CVE-2023-28487

Sudo, a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited
root privileges to users and log root activity, was vulnerable.

CVE-2023-7090

    A flaw was found in sudo in the handling of ipa_hostname, where
    ipa_hostname from /etc/sssd/sssd.conf was not propagated in sudo.
    Therefore, it leads to privilege mismanagement vulnerability in
    applications, where client hosts retain privileges even after
    retracting them.

CVE-2023-28486

    Sudo did not escape control characters in log messages.

CVE-2023-28487

    Sudo did not escape control characters in sudoreplay output.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.27-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Legacy Release

The sudo 1.8 branch is considered the *legacy* version.
It receives no new features, only critical bug fixes.
Users are highly encouraged to migrate to the sudo
[stable](/releases/stable) branch.

The current legacy release of sudo
is [1.8.32](/dist/sudo-1.8.32.tar.gz).

For full details see the [ChangeLog](/releases/changelog) file or
view the commit history via [git](https://git.sudo.ws/sudo) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo).

---

## Sudo 1.8.32

* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.9 where the *closefrom*
  sudoers option could not be set to a value of 3.
  [Bug #950](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=950).
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 in the LDAP back-end
  where sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter were applied even when the
  `SUDOERS_TIMED` setting was not present in `ldap.conf`.
  [Bug #945](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=945).
* Fixed a buffer size mismatch when serializing the list of IP
  addresses for configured network interfaces. This bug is not
  actually exploitable since the allocated buffer is large enough
  to hold the list of addresses.
* If sudo is executed with a name other than **sudo**
  or **sudoedit**, it will now fall back to
  **sudo** as the program name. This affects
  warning, help and usage messages as well as the matching
  of Debug lines in the `/etc/sudo.conf` file.
  Previously, it was possible for the invoking user to
  manipulate the program name by setting `argv[0]` to
  an arbitrary value when executing sudo.
* Sudo now checks for failure when setting the close-on-exec flag
  on open file descriptors. This should never fail but, if it
  were to, there is the possibility of a file descriptor leak to
  a child process (such as the command sudo runs).
* Fixed [CVE-2021-23239](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23239),
  a potential information leak in sudoedit
  that could be used to test for the existence of directories not
  normally accessible to the user in certain circumstances. When
  creating a new file, sudoedit checks to make sure the parent
  directory of the new file exists before running the editor.
  However, a race condition exists if the invoking user can replace
  (or create) the parent directory. If a symbolic link is created
  in place of the parent directory, sudoedit will run the editor
  as long as the target of the link exists. If the target of the
  link does not exist, an error message will be displayed. The
  race condition can be used to test for the existence of an
  arbitrary directory. However, it *cannot* be used
  to write to an arbitrary location.
* Fixed [CVE-2021-23240](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23240),
  a flaw in the temporary file handling of
  sudoedit’s SELinux RBAC support. On systems where SELinux is
  enabled, a user with sudoedit permissions may be able to set the
  owner of an arbitrary file to the user-ID of the target user.
  On Linux kernels that support *protected symlinks* setting
  `/proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks` to 1 will prevent the bug from
  being exploited. For more information, see
  [Symbolic link attack in SELinux-enabled sudoedit](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_selinux).
* Added writability checks for `sudoedit` when SELinux
  RBAC is in use. This makes `sudoedit` behavior consistent
  regardless of whether or not SELinux RBAC is in use.
  Previously, the *sudoedit\_checkdir* setting had no
  effect for RBAC entries.
* When invoked as `sudoedit`, the same set of command line options
  are now accepted as for `sudo -e`. The `-H` and `-P` options are
  now rejected for `sudoedit` and `sudo -e` which matches the
  sudo 1.7 behavior. This is part of the fix for [CVE-2021-3156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156).
* Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes
  in the command’s arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special
  characters when running a command via a shell (`sudo -s` or `sudo -i`). However, it was also possible
  to run `sudoedit` with the `-s` or
  `-i` flags in which case no escaping had
  actually been done, making a buffer overflow possible. This
  fixes [CVE-2021-3156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156).

---

## Sudo 1.8.31p2

* Sudo command line options that take a value may only be specified
  once. This is to help guard against problems caused by poorly
  written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input.
  [Bug #924](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=924).
* When running a command in a pty, sudo will no longer try to
  suspend itself if the user’s tty has been revoked (for instance
  when the parent ssh daemon is killed). This fixes a bug where
  sudo would continuously suspend the command (which would succeed),
  then suspend itself (which would fail due to the missing tty)
  and then resume the command.
* If sudo’s event loop fails due to the tty being revoked,
  remove the user’s tty events and restart the event loop
  (once). This fixes a problem when running `sudo reboot`
  in a pty on some systems. When the event loop exited
  unexpectedly, sudo would kill the command running in the
  pty, which in the case of `reboot`, could lead to
  the system being in a half-rebooted state.
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 in the LDAP and
  SSSD back-ends where a missing `sudoHost` attribute
  was treated as an `ALL` wildcard value. A
  `sudoRole` with no `sudoHost` attribute is
  now ignored as it was prior to version 1.8.23.

---

## Sudo 1.8.31p1

* Sudo once again ignores a failure to restore the
  `RLIMIT_CORE` resource limit, as it did prior to
  version 1.8.29. Linux containers don’t allow `RLIMIT_CORE`
  to be set back to `RLIM_INFINITY` if we set the limit
  to zero, even for root, which resulted in a warning from
  sudo.

---

## Sudo 1.8.31

* Fixed [CVE-2019-18634](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18634),
  a buffer overflow when the *pwfeedback*
  sudoers option is enabled on systems with uni-directional pipes.
* The *sudoedit\_checkdir* option now treats a user-owned directory
  as writable, even if it does not have the write bit set at the
  time of check. Symbolic links will no longer be followed by
  sudoedit in any user-owned directory.
  [Bug #912](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=912).
* Fixed sudoedit on macOS 10.15 and above where the root file system
  is mounted read-only.
  [Bug #913](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=913).
* Fixed a crash introduced in sudo 1.8.30 when suspending sudo
  at the password prompt.
  [Bug #914](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=914).
* Fixed compilation on systems where the mmap `MAP_ANON` flag
  is not available.
  [Bug #915](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=915).

---

## Sudo 1.8.30

* Fixed a warning on macOS introduced in sudo 1.8.29 when sudo
  attempts to set the open file limit to unlimited.
  [Bug #904](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=904).
* Sudo now closes file descriptors before changing uids. This
  prevents a non-root process from interfering with sudo’s ability
  to close file descriptors on systems that support the prlimit(2)
  system call.
* Sudo now treats an attempt to run `sudo sudoedit` as simply
  `sudoedit` If the sudoers file contains a fully-qualified path
  to sudoedit, sudo will now treat it simply as `sudoedit` (with
  no path). Visudo will will now treat a fully-qualified path
  to sudoedit as an error.
  [Bug #871](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=871).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would warn about
  a missing `/etc/environment` file on AIX and Linux when PAM
  is not enabled.
  [Bug #907](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=907).
* Fixed a bug on Linux introduced in sudo 1.8.29 that prevented
  the askpass program from running due to an unlimited stack size
  resource limit.
  [Bug #908](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=908).
* If a group provider plugin has optional arguments, the argument list
  passed to the plugin is now NULL terminated as per the documentation.
* The user’s time stamp file is now only updated if both authentication
  and approval phases succeed. This is consistent with the behavior
  of sudo prior to version 1.8.23.
  [Bug #910](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=910).
* The new *allow\_unknown\_runas\_id* sudoers setting can be used to
  enable or disable the use of unknown user or group IDs. Previously,
  sudo would always allow unknown user or group IDs if the sudoers
  entry permitted it, including via the *ALL* alias. As of sudo
  1.8.30, the admin must explicitly enable support for unknown IDs.
* The new *runas\_check\_shell* sudoers setting can be used to
  require that the runas user have a shell listed in the
  `/etc/shells` file. On many systems, users such as
  **bin**, do not have a valid shell and this
  flag can be used to prevent commands from being run as those
  users.

  Fixed a problem restoring the SELinux tty context during reboot
  if mctransd is killed before sudo finishes.
  [GitHub Issue #17](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/17).
* Fixed an intermittent warning on NetBSD when sudo restores the
  initial stack size limit.

---

## Sudo 1.8.29

* The cvtsudoers command will now reject non-LDIF input when converting
  from LDIF format to sudoers or JSON formats.
* The new *log\_allowed* and *log\_denied* sudoers settings
  make it possible to disable logging and auditing of allowed
  and/or denied commands.
* The umask is now handled differently on systems with PAM or login.conf.
  If the umask is explicitly set in sudoers, that value is
  used regardless of what PAM or login.conf may specify.
  However, if the umask is not explicitly set in sudoers, PAM
  or login.conf may now override the default sudoers umask.
  [Bug #900](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=900).
* For *make install*, the sudoers file is no longer
  checked for syntax errors when `DESTDIR` is set.
  The default sudoers file includes the contents of
  `/etc/sudoers.d` which may not be readable as non-root.
  [Bug #902](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=902).
* Sudo now sets most resource limits to their maximum value to avoid
  problems caused by insufficient resources, such as an inability to
  allocate memory or open files and pipes.
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would refuse
  to run if the parent process was not associated with a session.
  This was due to sudo passing a session ID of -1 to the plugin.

---

## Sudo 1.8.28p1

* The fix for
  [Bug #869](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=869)
  caused `sudo -v` to prompt for a password when
  *verifypw* is set to *all* (the default) and
  all of the user’s sudoers entries are marked with
  `NOPASSWD`.
  [Bug #901](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=901).

---

## Sudo 1.8.28

* Sudo will now only set `PAM_TTY` to the empty string
  when no terminal is present on Solaris and Linux. This
  workaround is only needed on those systems which may have
  PAM modules that misbehave when `PAM_TTY` is not set.
* The *mailerflags* sudoers option now has a default value
  even if sendmail support was disabled at configure time.
  Fixes a crash when the *mailerpath* sudoers option is set but
  *mailerflags* is not.
  [Bug #878](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=878).
* Sudo will now filter out last login messages on HP-UX unless it
  a shell is being run via `sudo -s` or `sudo -i`.
  Otherwise, when trusted mode is enabled, these messages will be
  displayed for each command.
* On AIX, when the user’s password has expired and PAM is not in use,
  sudo will now allow the user to change their password.
  [Bug #883](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=883).
* Sudo has a new `-B` command line option that will
  ring the terminal bell when prompting for a password.
* Sudo no longer refuses to prompt for a password when it
  cannot determine the user’s terminal as long as it can open
  `/dev/tty`. This allows sudo to function on systems
  where `/proc` is unavailable, such as when running
  in a chroot environment.
* The *env\_editor* sudoers flag is now on by default.
  This makes source builds more consistent with the packages
  generated by sudo’s mkpkg script.
* Sudo no longer ships with pre-formatted copies of the manual pages.
  These were included for systems like IRIX that don’t ship with an
  nroff utility. There are now multiple Open Source nroff replacements
  so this should no longer be an issue.
* Fixed a bad interaction with configure’s `--prefix` and
  `--disable-shared` options.
  [Bug #886](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=886).
* More verbose error message when a password is required and
  no terminal is present.
  [Bug #828](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=828).
* Command tags, such as `NOPASSWD`, are honored when
  a user tries to run a command that is allowed by sudoers
  but which does not actually exist on the file system.
  [Bug #888](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=888).
* Asturian translation for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* I/O log timing files now store signal suspend and resume information
  in the form of a signal name instead of a number.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.24 that prevented sudo from
  honoring the value of *ipa\_hostname* from `sssd.conf`, if
  specified, when matching the host name. This flaw has been assigned
  [CVE-2023-7090](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-7090).
* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.21 that prevented the core dump
  resource limit set in the pam\_limits module from taking effect.
  [Bug #894](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=894).
* Fixed parsing of double-quoted Defaults group and netgroup bindings.
* The user ID is now used when matching sudoUser attributes in LDAP.
  Previously, the user name, group name and group IDs were used
  when matching but not the user ID.
* Sudo now writes PAM messages to the user’s terminal, if available,
  instead of the standard output or standard error. This prevents
  PAM output from being intermixed with that of the command when
  output is sent to a file or pipe.
  [Bug #895](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=895).
* Sudoedit now honors the *umask* and *umask\_override*
  settings in sudoers. Previously, the user’s umask was used as-is.
* Fixed a bug where the terminal’s file context was not restored
  when using SELinux RBAC.
  [Bug #898](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=895).
* Fixed a [security issue](/security/advisories/minus_1_uid)
  where a sudo user may be able to run a command as root when
  the Runas specification explicitly disallows root access
  as long as the ALL keyword is listed first.
  This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2019-14287](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14287).

---

## Sudo 1.8.27

* On HP-UX, sudo will now update the utmps file when running a command
  in a pseudo-tty. Previously, only the utmp and utmpx files were
  updated.
* Nanosecond precision file time stamps are now supported on HP-UX.
* Fixes and clarifications to the sudo plugin documentation.
* The sudo manuals no longer require extensive post-processing to
  hide system-specific features. Conditionals in the roff source
  are now used instead. This fixes corruption of the sudo manual
  on systems without BSD login classes.
  [Bug #861](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=861).
* If an I/O logging plugin is configured but the plugin does not
  actually log any I/O, sudo will no longer force the command to
  be run in a pseudo-tty.
* The fix for
  [bug #843](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=843)
  in sudo 1.8.24 was incomplete. If the user’s password was
  expired or needed to be updated, but no sudo password was
  required, the PAM handle was freed too early, resulting in
  a failure when processing PAM session modules.
* In visudo, it is now possible to specify the path to sudoers
  without using the `-f` option.
  [Bug #864](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=864).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.22 where the utmp (or utmpx)
  file would not be updated when a command was run in a pseudo-tty.
  [Bug #865](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=865).
* Sudo now sets the silent flag when opening the PAM session except
  when running a shell via `sudo -s` or `sudo -i`.
  This prevents the pam\_lastlog module from printing the last
  login information for each sudo command.
  [Bug #867](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=867).
* Sudo now sets the silent flag when opening the PAM session except
  when running a shell via `sudo -s` or `sudo -i`.
  This prevents the pam\_lastlog module from printing the last
  login information for each sudo command.
  [Bug #867](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=867).
* Fixed the default AIX hard resource limit for the maximum number
  of files a user may have open. If no hard limit for *nofiles*
  is explicitly set in `/etc/security/limits`, the default should
  be `unlimited`. Previously, the default hard limit was 8196.

---

## Sudo 1.8.26

* Fixed a bug in cvtsudoers when converting to JSON format when
  alias expansion is enabled.
  [Bug #853](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=853).
* Sudo no long sets the `USERNAME` environment variable when running
  commands. This is a non-standard environment variable that was
  set on some older Linux systems.
* Sudo now treats the `LOGNAME` and `USER` environment variables (as
  well as the `LOGIN` variable on AIX) as a single unit. If one is
  preserved or removed from the environment using env\_keep, env\_check
  or env\_delete, so is the other.
* Added support for OpenLDAP’s `TLS_REQCERT` setting in ldap.conf.
* Sudo now logs when the command was suspended and resumed in the
  I/O logs. This information is used by sudoreplay to skip the
  time suspended when replaying the session unless the new `-S` flag
  is used.
* Fixed documentation problems found by the igor utility.
  [Bug #854](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=854).
* Sudo now prints a warning message when there is an error or end
  of file while reading the password instead of exiting silently.
* Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end parsing the command\_timeout,
  role, type, privs and limitprivs sudoOptions. This also affected
  cvtsudoers conversion from LDIF to sudoers or JSON.
* Fixed a bug that prevented timeout settings in sudoers from
  functioning unless a timeout was also specified on the command
  line.
* Asturian translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* When generating LDIF output, cvtsudoers can now be configured
  to pad the sudoOrder increment such that the start order is used
  as a prefix.
  [Bug #856](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=856).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that prevented sudo from
  properly setting the user’s groups on AIX.
  [Bug #857](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=857).
* If the user specifies a group via sudo’s -g option that matches
  any of the target user’s groups, it is now allowed even if no
  groups are present in the Runas\_Spec. Previously, it was only
  allowed if it matched the target user’s primary group.
* The sudoers LDAP back-end now supports negated sudoRunAsUser and
  sudoRunAsGroup entries.
* Sudo now provides a proper error message when the *fqdn* sudoers
  option is set and it is unable to resolve the local host name.
  [Bug #859](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=859).
* Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Sudo now includes sudoers LDAP schema for the on-line configuration
  supported by OpenLDAP.

---

## Sudo 1.8.25p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that caused a crash on
  systems that have the `poll()` function but not the
  `ppoll()` function.
  [Bug #851](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=851).

---

## Sudo 1.8.25

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.20 that broke formatting of
  I/O log timing file entries on systems without a C99-compatible
  `snprintf()` function. Our replacement `snprintf()`
  doesn’t support floating point so we can’t use the *%f* format
  directive.
* I/O log timing file entries now use a monotonic timer and include
  nanosecond precision. A monotonic timer that does not increment
  while the system is sleeping is used where available.
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where sudoNotAfter in the LDAP
  backend was not being properly parsed.
  [Bug #845](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=845).
* When sudo runs a command in a pseudo-tty, the slave device is
  now closed in the main process immediately after starting the
  monitor process. This removes the need for an AIX-specific
  workaround that was added in sudo 1.8.24.
* Added support for monotonic timers on HP-UX.
* Fixed a bug displaying timeout values the `sudo -V` output.
  The value displayed was 3600 times the actual value.
  [Bug #846](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=846).
* Fixed a build issue on AIX 7.1 BOS levels that include memset\_s()
  and define rsize\_t in string.h.
  [Bug #847](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=847).
* The testsudoers utility now supports querying an LDIF-format
  policy.
* Sudo now sets the `LOGIN` environment variable to the
  same value as `LOGNAME` on AIX systems.
  [Bug #848](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=848).
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where the LDAP and
  SSSD backends evaluated the rules in reverse sudoOrder.
  [Bug #849](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=849).

---

## Sudo 1.8.24

* The LDAP and SSS back-ends now use the same rule evaluation code
  as the sudoers file backend. This builds on the work in sudo
  1.8.23 where the formatting functions for `sudo -l`
  output were shared. The handling of negated commands in SSS
  and LDAP is unchanged.
* Fixed a regression introduced in 1.8.23 where `sudo -i` could
  not be used in conjunction with `--preserve-env=VARIABLE`.
  [Bug #835](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=835).
* cvtsudoers can now parse base64-encoded attributes in LDIF files.
* Random insults are now more random.
* Fixed the noexec wordexp(3) test on FreeBSD.
* Added `SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY` flag for conversation function to
  tell sudo to try writing to `/dev/tty` first. Can be used in
  conjunction with `SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG` and
  `SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG`.
* Sudo now supports an arbitrary number of groups per user on
  Solaris. Previously, only the first 64 groups were found.
  This should remove the need to set *max\_groups* in sudo.conf.
* Fixed typos in the OpenLDAP sudo schema. Bugs #839 and #840.
  [Bug #839](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=839)
  and
  [bug #840](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=840).
* Fixed a race condition when building with parallel make.
  [Bug #842](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=842).
* Fixed a duplicate free when `netgroup_base` in
  `ldap.conf` is set to an invalid value.
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.23 on AIX that could prevent
  local users and groups from being resolved properly on systems
  that have users stored in NIS, LDAP or AD.
* Added a workaround for an AIX bug exposed by a change in sudo
  1.8.23 that prevents the terminal mode from being restored when
  I/O logging is enabled.
* On systems using PAM, sudo now ignores the `PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD`
  and `PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED` errors from PAM account management if
  authentication is disabled for the user. This fixes a regression
  introduced in sudo 1.8.23.
  [Bug #843](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=843).
* Fixed an ambiguity in the sudoers manual in the description and
  definition of User, Runas, Host, and Cmnd Aliases.
  [Bug #834](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=834).
* Fixed a bug that resulted in only the first window size change
  event being logged.
* Fixed a bug on HP-UX systems introduced in sudo 1.8.22 that
  caused sudo to prompt for a password every time when tty-based
  time stamp files were in use.
* Fixed a compilation problem on systems that define `O_PATH` or
  `O_SEARCH` in fnctl.h but do not define `O_DIRECTORY`.
  [Bug #844](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=844).

---

## Sudo 1.8.23

* PAM account management modules and BSD auth approval modules are
  now run even when no password is required.
* For kernel-based time stamps, if no terminal is present, fall
  back to parent-pid style time stamps.
* The new `cvtsudoers` utility replaces both the
  `sudoers2ldif` script and the `visudo -x`
  functionality. It can read a file in either sudoers or
  LDIF format and produce JSON, LDIF or sudoers output. It
  is also possible to filter the generated output file by
  user, group or host name.
* The file, ldap and sss sudoers backends now share a common set
  of formatting functions for `sudo -l` output, which is also used
  by the `cvtsudoers` utility.
* The `/run` directory is now used in preference to
  `/var/run` if it exists.
  [Bug #822](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=822).
* More accurate descriptions of the `--with-rundir` and `--with-vardir`
  configure options.
  [Bug #823](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=823).
* The setpassent() and setgroupent() functions are now used on systems
  that support them to keep the passwd and group database open.
  Sudo performs a lot of passwd and group lookups so it can be
  beneficial to avoid opening and closing the files each time.
* The new *case\_insensitive\_user* and *case\_insensitive\_group* sudoers
  options can be used to control whether sudo does case-sensitive
  matching of users and groups in sudoers. Case insensitive
  matching is now the default.
* Fixed a bug on some systems where sudo could hang on command
  exit when I/O logging was enabled.
  [Bug #826](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=826).
* Fixed a problem with the process start time test in `make check`
  when run in a Linux container. The test now uses the *btime*
  field in `/proc/stat` to get the system start time instead
  of using `/proc/uptime`, which is the container uptime.
  [Bug #829](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=829).
* When determining which temporary directory to use, `sudoedit`
  now checks the directory for writability before using it. Previously,
  sudoedit only performed an existence check.
  [Bug #827](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=827).
* Sudo now includes an optional set of Monty Python-inspired insults.
* Fixed the execution of scripts with an associated digest (checksum)
  in sudoers on FreeBSD systems. FreeBSD does not have a full
  `/dev/fd` directory mounted by default and its fexecve(2) is
  not fully POSIX compliant when executing scripts.
  [Bug #831](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=831).
* Chinese (Taiwan) translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).

---

## Sudo 1.8.22

* Commands run in the background from a script run via sudo will
  no longer receive `SIGHUP` when the parent exits and I/O logging
  is enabled.
  [Bug #502](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=502).
* A particularly offensive insult is now disabled by default.
  [Bug #804](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=804).
* The description of `sudo -i` now correctly documents that
  the *env\_keep* and *env\_check* sudoers options are
  applied to the environment.
  [Bug #806](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=806).
* Fixed a crash when the system’s host name is not set.
  [Bug #807](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=807).
* The `sudoers2ldif` script now handles `#include`
  and `#includedir` directives.
* Fixed a bug where sudo would silently exit when the command was
  not allowed by sudoers and the *passwd\_tries* sudoers option
  was set to a value less than one.
* Fixed a bug with the *listpw* and *verifypw*
  sudoers options and multiple sudoers sources. If the option
  is set to *all* a password should be required unless
  none of a user’s sudoers entries from any source require
  authentication.
* Fixed a bug with the *listpw* and *verifypw*
  sudoers options in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends. If the
  option is set to *any* and the entry contained multiple
  rules, only the first matching rule was checked. If an
  entry contained more than one matching rule and the first
  rule required authentication but a subsequent rule did not,
  sudo would prompt for a password when it should not have.
* When running a command as the invoking user (not root), sudo
  would execute the command with the same group vector it was
  started with. Sudo now executes the command with a new group
  vector based on the group database which is consistent with
  how su(1) operates.
* Fixed a double free in the SSSD back-end that could occur when
  ipa\_hostname is present in sssd.conf and is set to an unqualified
  host name.
* When I/O logging is enabled, sudo will now write to the terminal
  even when it is a background process. Previously, sudo would
  only write to the tty when it was the foreground process when
  I/O logging was enabled. If the `TOSTOP` terminal flag is set,
  sudo will suspend the command (and then itself) with the `SIGTTOU`
  signal.
* A new *authfail\_message* sudoers option that overrides the
  default `N incorrect password attempt(s)`.
* An empty *sudoRunAsUser* attribute in the LDAP and SSSD backends
  will now match the invoking user. This is more consistent with
  how an empty runas user in the sudoers file is treated.
* Documented that in check mode, visudo does not check the owner/mode
  on files specified with the -f flag.
  [Bug #809](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=809).
* It is now an error to specify the runas user as an empty string
  on the command line. Previously, an empty runas user was treated
  the same as an unspecified runas user.
  [Bug #817](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=817).
* When *timestamp\_type* option is set to *tty*
  and a terminal is present, the time stamp record will now
  include the start time of the session leader. When the
  *timestamp\_type* option is set to *ppid* or
  when no terminal is available, the start time of the parent
  process is used instead. This significantly reduces the
  likelihood of a time stamp record being re-used when a user
  logs out and back in again.
  [Bug #818](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=818).
* The sudoers time stamp file format is now documented in the new
  [sudoers\_timestamp](/docs/man/sudoers_timestamp.man)
  manual.
* The *timestamp\_type* option now takes a *kernel*
  value on OpenBSD systems. This causes the tty-based time stamp
  to be stored in the kernel instead of on the file system.
  If no tty is present, the time stamp is considered to be invalid.
* Visudo will now use the `SUDO_EDITOR` environment variable (if
  present) in addition to `VISUAL` and `EDITOR`.

---

## Sudo 1.8.21p2

* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented sudo
  from using the PAM-supplied prompt.
  [Bug #799](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=799).
* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which could result in
  sudo hanging when running commands that exit quickly.
  [Bug #800](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=800).
* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented the
  command from being run when the password was read via an external
  program using the askpass interface.
  [Bug #801](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=801).

---

## Sudo 1.8.21p1

* On systems that support both PAM and `SIGINFO`, the main sudo
  process will no longer forward `SIGINFO` to the command if the
  signal was generated from the keyboard. The command will have
  already received `SIGINFO` since it is part of the same process
  group so there’s no need for sudo to forward it. This is
  consistent with the handling of `SIGINT`, `SIGQUIT` and `SIGTSTP`.
  [Bug #796](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=796).
* If `SUDOERS_SEARCH_FILTER` in ldap.conf does not specify a value,
  the LDAP search expression used when looking up netgroups and
  non-Unix groups had a syntax error if a group plugin was not
  specified.
* `sudo -U otheruser -l` will now have an exit value of 0 even
  if *otheruser* has no sudo privileges. The exit value when a
  user attempts to lists their own privileges or when a command
  is specified is unchanged.
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.21 where sudoreplay
  playback would hang for I/O logs that contain terminal input.
* Sudo 1.8.18 contained an incomplete fix for the matching of
  entries in the LDAP and SSSD backends when a sudoRunAsGroup is
  specified but no sudoRunAsUser is present in the sudoRole.

---

## Sudo 1.8.21

* The path that sudo uses to search for terminal devices can now
  be configured via the new *devsearch* Path setting in
  sudo.conf.
* It is now possible to preserve bash shell functions in the
  environment when the *env\_reset* sudoers setting is disabled by
  removing the “*=()*” pattern from the env\_delete list.
* A change made in sudo 1.8.15 inadvertently caused sudoedit to
  send itself `SIGHUP` instead of exiting when the editor returns
  an error or the file was not modified.
* Sudoedit now uses an exit code of zero if the file was not
  actually modified. Previously, sudoedit treated a lack of
  modifications as an error.
* When running a command in a pseudo-tty (pty), sudo now
  copies a subset of the terminal flags to the new pty. Previously,
  all flags were copied, even those not appropriate for a pty.
* Fixed a problem with debug logging in the sudoers I/O logging
  plugin.
* Window size change events are now logged to the policy plugin.
  On xterm and compatible terminals, sudoreplay is now capable of
  resizing the terminal to match the size of the terminal the
  command was run on. The new -R option can be used to disable
  terminal resizing.
* Fixed a bug in visudo where a newly added file was not checked
  for syntax errors.
  [Bug #791](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=791).
* Fixed a bug in visudo where if a syntax error in an include
  directory (like `/etc/sudoers.d`) was detected, the
  edited version was left as a temporary file instead of being installed.
* On PAM systems, sudo will now treat *username’s Password:*
  as a standard password prompt. As a result, the `SUDO_PROMPT`
  environment variable will now override *username’s Password:*
  as well as the more common *Password:*. Previously, the
  *passprompt\_override* Defaults setting would need to be set
  for `SUDO_PROMPT` to override a prompt of
  *username’s Password:*.
* A new *syslog\_pid* sudoers setting has been added to include
  sudo’s process ID along with the process name when logging via
  syslog.
  [Bug #792](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=792).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where a command would
  not be terminated when the I/O logging plugin returned an error
  to the sudo front-end.
* A new *timestamp\_type* sudoers setting has been added
  that replaces the *tty\_tickets* option. In addition
  to tty and global time stamp records, it is now possible
  to use the parent process ID to restrict the time stamp to
  commands run by the same process, usually the shell.
  [Bug #793](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=793).
* The `--preserve-env` command line option has been extended to
  accept a comma-separated list of environment variables to preserve.
* A new Friulian translation from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).

## Sudo 1.8.20p2

* Fixed a bug parsing `/proc/pid/stat`
  on Linux when the process name contain a newline.
  This is not exploitable due to the `/dev`
  traversal changes made in sudo 1.8.20p1.

---

## Sudo 1.8.20p1

* Fixed `make check` when using OpenSSL or GNU crypt.
  [Bug #787](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=787).
* Fixed [CVE-2017-1000367](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000367), a bug parsing `/proc/pid/stat`
  on Linux when the process name contains spaces. Since the
  user has control over the command name, this could potentially
  be used by a user with sudo access to overwrite an arbitrary
  file on systems with SELinux enabled. Also stop performing
  a breadth-first traversal of `/dev` when looking for
  the device; only a hard-coded list of directories are
  checked,

---

## Sudo 1.8.20

* Added support for SASL\_MECH in ldap.conf.
  [Bug #764](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=764).
* Added support for digest matching when the command is a glob-style
  pattern or a directory. Previously, only explicit path matches
  supported digest checks.
* New *fdexec* Defaults option to control whether a command
  is executed by path or by open file descriptor.
* The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.11.
* Fixed a bug that prevented sudoers include files with a relative
  path starting with the letter ‘i’ from being opened.
  [Bug #776](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=776).
* Added support for command timeouts in sudoers. The command will
  be terminated if the timeout expires.
* The SELinux role and type are now displayed in the `sudo -l`
  output for the LDAP and SSSD backends, just as they are in the
  sudoers backend.
* A new command line option, `-T`, can be used to specify a command
  timeout as long as the user-specified timeout is not longer than
  the timeout specified in sudoers. This option may only be
  used when the *user\_command\_timeouts* flag is enabled in sudoers.
* Added `NOTBEFORE` and `NOTAFTER` command options
  to the sudoers
  backend similar to what is already available in the LDAP backend.
* Sudo can now optionally use the SHA2 functions in OpenSSL or GNU
  crypt instead of the SHA2 implementation bundled with sudo.
* Fixed a compilation error on systems without the stdbool.h header
  file.
  [Bug #778](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=778).
* Fixed a compilation error in the standalone Kerberos V authentication
  module.
  [Bug #777](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=777).
* Added the *iolog\_flush* flag to sudoers which causes I/O
  log data to be written immediately to disk instead of being buffered.
* I/O log files are now created with group ID 0 by default unless
  the *iolog\_user* or *iolog\_group* options are set
  in sudoers.
* It is now possible to store I/O log files on an NFS-mounted
  file system where uid 0 is remapped to an unprivileged user.
  The *iolog\_user* option must be set to a non-root user and the
  top-level I/O log directory must exist and be owned by that user.
* Added the *restricted\_env\_file* setting to sudoers which is
  similar to env\_file but its contents are subject to the same
  restrictions as variables in the invoking user’s environment.
* Fixed a use after free bug in the SSSD backend when the fqdn
  sudoOption is set and no hostname value is present in `sssd.conf`.
* Fixed a typo that resulted in a compilation error on systems
  where the killpg() function is not found by configure.
* Fixed a compilation error with the bundled version of zlib
  when sudo was built outside the source tree.
* Fixed the exit value of sudo when the command is terminated by
  a signal other than `SIGINT`. This was broken in sudo 1.8.15 by
  the fix for
  [Bug #722](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=722)
  [Bug #784](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=784).
* Fixed exponential behavior in sudo’s glob() replacement
  with respect to multiple ‘\*’ characters.
* Sudo no longer needs to display a message when a command
  running in a pseudo-tty is killed by a signal. Now that
  the main sudo process delivers the same signal to itself
  the parent shell will display the message itself.
* Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where the
  *lecture* option could not be used in a positive
  boolean context, only a negative one.
* Fixed an issue where sudo would consume stdin if it was not connected
  to a tty even if log\_input is not enabled in sudoers.
  [Bug #786](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=786).

---

## Sudo 1.8.19p2

* Fixed a crash in visudo introduced in sudo 1.8.9 when an IP address
  or network is used in a host-based Defaults entry.
  [Bug #766](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=766).
* Added a missing check for the ignore\_iolog\_errors flag when
  the sudoers plugin generates the I/O log file path name.
* Fixed a typo in sudo’s vsyslog() replacement that resulted in
  garbage being logged to syslog.

---

## Sudo 1.8.19p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.19 that resulted in the wrong
  syslog priority and facility being used.

---

## Sudo 1.8.19

* New *syslog\_maxlen* Defaults option to control the maximum
  size of syslog messages generated by sudo.
* Sudo has been run against PVS-Studio and any issues that were
  not false positives have been addressed.
* I/O log files are now created same group ID as the parent directory
  and not the invoking user’s group ID.
* I/O log permissions and ownership are now configurable via the
  *iolog\_mode*, *iolog\_user* and *iolog\_group*
  sudoers Defaults variables.
* Fixed configuration of the sudoers I/O log plugin debug subsystem.
  Previously, I/O log information was not being written to the
  sudoers debug log.
* Fixed a bug in visudo that broke editing of files in an include
  dir that have a syntax error. Normally, visudo does not edit
  those files, but if a syntax error is detected in one, the user
  should get a chance to fix it.
* Warnings about unknown or unparsable sudoers Defaults entries now
  include the file and line number of the problem.
* Visudo will now use the file and line number information about an
  unknown or unparsable Defaults entry to go directly to the file
  with the problem.
* Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end where a negated sudoHost
  entry would prevent other sudoHost entries following it from matching.
* Warnings from visudo about a cycle in an Alias entry now include the
  file and line number of the problem.
* In strict mode, visudo will now use the file and line number
  information about a cycle in an Alias entry to go directly to the
  file with the problem.
* The sudo\_noexec.so file is now linked with -ldl on systems that
  require it for the wordexp() wrapper.
* Fixed linking of sudo\_noexec.so on macOS systems where it must be
  a dynamic library and not a module.
* Sudo’s `make check` now includes a test for sudo\_noexec.so
  working.
* The sudo front-end now passes the user’s umask to the plugin.
  Previously the plugin had to determine this itself.
* Sudoreplay can now display the *stdin* and
  *ttyin* streams when they
  are explicitly added to the filter list.
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.17 where the *all* setting
  for verifypw and listpw was not being honored.
  [Bug #762](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=762).
* The syslog priority (*syslog\_goodpri* and
  *syslog\_badpri*) can now be negated or set to
  *none* to disable logging of successful or
  unsuccessful sudo attempts via syslog.

---

## Sudo 1.8.18p1

* When sudo\_noexec.so is used, the `WRDE_NOCMD` flag is now added
  if the wordexp() function is called. This prevents commands
  from being run via wordexp() without disabling it entirely.
* On Linux systems, sudo\_noexec.so now uses a seccomp filter to
  disable execute access if the kernel supports seccomp. This is
  more robust than the traditional method of using stub functions
  that return an error.

---

## Sudo 1.8.18

* The sudoers locale is now set before parsing the sudoers file.
  If sudoers\_locale is set in sudoers, it is applied before
  evaluating other Defaults entries. Previously, sudoers\_locale
  was used when evaluating sudoers but not during the initial parse.
  [Bug #748](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=748).
* A missing or otherwise invalid #includedir is now ignored instead
  of causing a parse error.
* During `make install`, backup files are only used on HP-UX where
  it is not possible to unlink a shared object that is in use.
  This works around a bug in ldconfig on Linux which could create
  links to the backup shared library file instead of the current
  one.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where sudoers entries with long
  commands lines could be truncated, preventing a match.
  [Bug #752](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=752).
* The fqdn, runas\_default and sudoers\_locale Defaults settings are
  now applied before any other Defaults settings since they can
  change how other Defaults settings are parsed.
* On systems without the `O_NOFOLLOW` open(2) flag, when the `NOFOLLOW`
  flag is set, sudoedit now checks whether the file is a symbolic link
  before opening it as well as after the open.
  [Bug #753](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=753).
* Sudo will now only resolve a user’s group IDs to group names
  when sudoers includes group-based permissions. Group lookups
  can be expensive on some systems where the group database is
  not local.
* If the file system holding the sudo log file is full, allow
  the command to run unless the new ignore\_logfile\_errors Defaults
  option is disabled.
  [Bug #751](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=751).
* The ignore\_audit\_errors and ignore\_iolog\_errors Defaults options
  have been added to control sudo’s behavior when it is unable to
  write to the audit and I/O logs.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the `SIGPIPE` signal handler
  was not being restored when sudo directly executes the command.
* Fixed a bug where `sudo -l command` would indicate that a
  command was runnable even when denied by sudoers when using the
  LDAP or SSSD backends.
* The match\_group\_by\_gid Defaults option has been added to allow
  sites where group name resolution is slow and where sudoers only
  contains a small number of groups to match groups by group ID
  instead of by group name.
* Fixed a bug on Linux where a 32-bit sudo binary could fail with
  an “unable to allocate memory” error when run on a 64-bit system.
  [Bug #755](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=755).
* When parsing ldap.conf, sudo will now only treat a ‘#’ character
  as the start of a comment when it is at the beginning of the
  line.
* Fixed a potential crash when auditing is enabled and the audit
  function fails with an error.
  [Bug #756](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=756).
* Norwegian Nynorsk translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Fixed a typo that broke short host name matching when the fqdn
  flag is enabled in sudoers.
  [Bug #757](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=757).
* Negated sudoHost attributes are now supported by the LDAP and
  SSSD backends.
* Fixed matching entries in the LDAP and SSSD backends when a
  RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.
* Fixed `sudo -l` output in the LDAP and SSSD backends when
  a RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.

---

## Sudo 1.8.17p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the user’s groups were
  not set on systems that don’t use PAM.
  [Bug #749](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=749).

---

## Sudo 1.8.17

* On AIX, if `/etc/security/login.cfg` has auth\_type set to
  PAM\_AUTH but pam\_start(3) fails, fall back to AIX authentication.
  [Bug #740](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=740).
* Sudo now takes all sudoers sources into account when determining
  whether or not `sudo -l` or `sudo -b` should
  prompt for a password. In other words, if both file and
  ldap sudoers sources are in specified in /etc/nsswitch.conf,
  `sudo -v` will now require that all entries in both
  sources be have *NOPASSWD* (file) or *!authenticate*
  (ldap) in the entries.
* Sudo now ignores `SIGPIPE` until the command is executed.
  Previously, `SIGPIPE` was only ignored in a few select places.
  [Bug #739](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=739).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 where (non-syslog) log
  file entries were missing the newline when loglinelen is set to
  a non-positive number.
  [Bug #742](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=742).
* Unix groups are now set before the plugin session initialization
  code is run. This makes it possible to use dynamic groups with
  the Linux-PAM pam\_group module.
* Fixed a bug where a debugging statement could dereference a NULL
  pointer when looking up a group that doesn’t exist
  [Bug #743](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=743).
* Sudo has been run through the
  [Coverity](https://www.coverity.com)
  code scanner. A number of minor bugs have been fixed as a
  result. None were security issues.
* SELinux support, which was broken in 1.8.16, has been repaired.
* Fixed a bug when logging I/O where all output buffers might not
  get flushed at exit.
* Forward slashes are no longer escaped in the JSON output of
  `visudo -x`. This was never required by the standard and
  not escaping them improves readability of the output.
* Sudo no longer treats `PAM_SESSION_ERR` as a fatal error when
  opening the PAM session. Other errors from `pam_open_session`()
  are still treated as fatal. This avoids the “policy plugin
  failed session initialization” error message seen on some systems.
* Korean translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* The sssd backend now properly handles `sudo -U otheruser -l`.
* The sssd backend now uses the value of *ipa\_hostname* from
  sssd.conf, if specified.
* Fixed a hang on some systems when the command is being run
  in a pty and it failed to execute.
* When performing a wildcard match in sudoers, check for an exact
  string match if the user command was fully-qualified (or resolved
  via the PATH). This fixes an issue executing scripts on Linux
  when there are multiple wildcard matches with the same base name.
  [Bug #746](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=746).

---

## Sudo 1.8.16

* Fixed a compilation error on Solaris 10 with Stun Studio 12.
  [Bug #727](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=727).
* When preserving variables from the invoking user’s environment, if
  there are duplicates sudo now only keeps the first instance.
* Fixed a bug that could cause warning mail to be sent in list
  mode (`sudo -l`) for users without sudo privileges when the
  LDAP and SSSD backends are used.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the *mail\_no\_user* option from working
  properly with the LDAP backend.
* In the LDAP and SSSD backends, white space is now ignored between
  an operator (!, +, +=, -=) when parsing a sudoOption.
* It is now possible to disable Path settings in sudo.conf
  by omitting the path name.
* The sudoedit\_checkdir Defaults option is now enabled by default
  and has been extended. When editing files with sudoedit, each
  directory in the path to be edited is now checked. If a directory
  is writable by the invoking user, symbolic links will not be
  followed. If the parent directory of the file to be edited is
  writable, sudoedit will refuse to edit it.
  [Bug #707](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=707).
* The netgroup\_tuple Defaults option has been added to enable matching
  of the entire netgroup tuple, not just the host or user portion.
  [Bug #717](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=717).
* When matching commands based on the SHA2 digest, sudo will now
  use fexecve(2) to execute the command if it is available. This
  fixes a time of check versus time of use race condition when the
  directory holding the command is writable by the invoking user.
* On AIX systems, sudo now caches the auth registry string along
  with password and group information. This fixes a potential
  problem when a user or group of the same name exists in multiple
  auth registries. For example, local and LDAP.
* Fixed a crash in the SSSD backend when the invoking user is not
  found.
  [Bug #732](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=732).
* Added the `--enable-asan` configure flag to enable address sanitizer
  support. A few minor memory leaks have been plugged to quiet
  the ASAN leak detector.
* The value of \_PATH\_SUDO\_CONF may once again be overridden via
  [Bug #735](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=735).
* The sudoers2ldif script now handles multiple roles with same name.
* Fixed a compilation error on systems that have the posix\_spawn()
  and posix\_spawnp() functions but an unusable spawn.h header.
  [Bug #730](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=730).
* Fixed support for negating character classes in sudo’s version
  of the fnmatch() function.
* Fixed a bug in the LDAP and SSSD backends that could allow an
  unauthorized user to list another user’s privileges.
  [Bug #738](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=738).
* The PAM conversation function now works around an ambiguity in the
  PAM spec with respect to multiple messages.
  [Bug #726](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=726).
* Updated translations from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).

---

## Sudo 1.8.15

* Fixed a bug that prevented sudo from building outside the source tree
  on some platforms.
  [Bug #708](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=708).
* Fixed the location of the sssd library in the RHEL/Centos packages.
  [Bug #710](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=710).
* Fixed a build problem on systems that don’t implicitly include
  sys/types.h from other header files.
  [Bug #711](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=711).
* Fixed a problem on Linux using containers where sudo would ignore
  signals sent by a process in a different container.
* Sudo now refuses to run a command if the PAM session module
  returns an error.
* When editing files with sudoedit, symbolic links will no longer
  be followed by default. The old behavior can be restored by
  enabling the sudoedit\_follow option in sudoers or on a per-command
  basis with the *FOLLOW* and *NOFOLLOW* tags.
  [Bug #707](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=707).
* Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.14 that caused the last
  valid editor in the sudoers “editor” list to be used by visudo
  and sudoedit instead of the first.
  [Bug #714](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=714).
* Fixed a bug in visudo that prevented the addition of a final
  newline to edited files without one.
* Fixed a bug decoding certain base64 digests in sudoers when the
  intermediate format included a ‘=’ character.
* Individual records are now locked in the time stamp file instead
  of the entire file. This allows sudo to avoid prompting for a
  password multiple times on the same terminal when used in a
  pipeline. In other words, `sudo cat foo | sudo grep bar`
  now only prompts for the password once. Previously, both sudo
  processes would prompt for a password, often making it impossible
  to enter.
  [Bug #705](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=705).
* Fixed a bug where sudo would fail to run commands as a non-root
  user on systems that lack both setresuid() and setreuid().
  [Bug #713](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=713).
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented visudo
  from re-editing the correct file when a syntax error was detected.
* Fixed a bug where sudo would not relay a `SIGHUP` signal to the
  command when the terminal is closed and the command is not run
  in its own pseudo-tty.
  [Bug #719](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=708).
* If some, but not all, of the `LOGNAME`, `USER`
  or `USERNAME` environment variables have been preserved
  from the invoking user’s environment, sudo will now use the
  preserved value to set the remaining variables instead of
  using the runas user. This ensures that if, for example,
  only `LOGNAME` is present in the env\_keep list, that
  sudo will not set `USER` and `USERNAME` to
  the runas user.
* When the command sudo is running dies due to a signal, sudo
  will now send itself that same signal with the default
  signal handler installed instead of exiting. The bash shell
  appears to ignore some signals, e.g. `SIGINT`, unless
  the command being run is killed by that signal. This makes
  the behavior of commands run under sudo the same as without
  sudo when bash is the shell.
  [Bug #722](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=722).
* Slovak translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Hungarian and Slovak translations for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Previously, when env\_reset was enabled (the default) and the -s
  option was not used, the `SHELL` environment variable was set to the
  shell of the invoking user. Now, when env\_reset is enabled and
  the -s option is not used, `SHELL` is set based on the target user.
* Fixed challenge/response style BSD authentication.
* Added the *sudoedit\_checkdir* Defaults option to prevent
  sudoedit from editing files located in a directory that is writable by
  the invoking user.
* Added the *always\_query\_group\_plugin* Defaults option to control
  whether groups not found in the system group database are passed
  to the group plugin. Previously, unknown system groups were
  always passed to the group plugin.
* When creating a new file, sudoedit will now check that the file’s
  parent directory exists before running the editor.
* Fixed the compiler stack protector test in configure for compilers
  that support `-fstack-protector` but don’t actually have the
  ssp library available.

---

## Sudo 1.8.14p3

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14p2 that prevented sudo
  from working when no tty was present.
  [Bug #706](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=690).
* Fixed tty detection on newer AIX systems where dev\_t is 64-bit.

---

## Sudo 1.8.14p2

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the lecture
  file from being created.
  [Bug #704](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=690).

---

## Sudo 1.8.14p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the sssd
  backend from working.
  [Bug #703](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=690).

---

## Sudo 1.8.14

* Log messages on Mac OS X now respect sudoers\_locale when sudo
  is build with NLS support.
* The sudo manual pages now pass `mandoc -Tlint` with no warnings.
* Fixed a compilation problem on systems with the `sig2str`()
  function that do not define `SIG2STR_MAX` in signal.h.
* Worked around a compiler bug that resulted in unexpected behavior
  when returning an int from a function declared to return bool
  without an explicit cast.
* Worked around a bug in Mac OS X 10.10 BSD auditing where the
  `au_preselect`() fails for `AUE_sudo` events but
  succeeds for `AUE_DARWIN_sudo`.
* Fixed a hang on Linux systems with glibc when sudo is linked with
  jemalloc.
* When the user runs a command as a user ID that is not present in
  the password database via the -u flag, the command is now run
  with the group ID of the invoking user instead of group ID 0.
* Fixed a compilation problem on systems that don’t pull in
  definitions of uid\_t and gid\_t without sys/types.h or unistd.h.
* Fixed a compilation problem on newer AIX systems which use a
  struct st\_timespec for time stamps in struct stat that differs
  from struct timespec.
  [Bug #702](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=690).
* The example directory is now configurable via `--with-exampledir`
  and defaults to `DATAROOTDIR/examples/sudo` on BSD systems.
* The `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/sudo.conf` file is now installed
  as part of `make install` when systemd is in use.
* Fixed a linker problem on some systems with libintl.
  [Bug #690](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=690).
* Fixed compilation with compilers that don’t support `__func__`
  or `__FUNCTION__`.
* Sudo no longer needs to uses weak symbols to support localization
  in the warning functions. A registration function is used instead.
* Fixed a `setresuid`() failure in sudoers on Linux kernels where
  uid changes take the nproc resource limit into account.
* Fixed LDAP netgroup queries on AIX.
* Sudo will now display the custom prompt on Linux systems with PAM
  even if the “Password: " prompt is not localized by the PAM module.
  [Bug #701](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=701).
* Double-quoted values in an LDAP sudoOption are now supported
  for consistency with file-based sudoers.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the btime entry in `/proc/stat`
  from being parsed on Linux.

---

## Sudo 1.8.13

* The examples directory is now a subdirectory of the doc dir to
  conform to Debian guidelines.
  [Bug #682](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=682).
* Fixed a compilation error for siglist.c and signame.c on some
  systems.
  [Bug #686](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=686).
* Weak symbols are now used for `sudo_warn_gettext`() and
  `sudo_warn_strerror`() in libsudo\_util to avoid link errors
  when *-Wl,–no-undefined* is used in `LDFLAGS`.
  The `--disable-weak-symbols` configure option can be used
  to disable the user of weak symbols.
* Fixed a bug in sudo’s `mkstemps`() replacement function that
  prevented the file extension from being preserved in sudoedit.
* A new `mail_all_cmnds` sudoers option will send mail when a user runs
  a command (or tries to). The behavior of the mail\_always flag has
  been restored to always send mail when sudo is run.
* New `MAIL` and `NOMAIL` command tags have been added
  to toggle mail sending behavior on a per-command (or Cmnd\_Alias) basis.
* Fixed matching of empty passwords when sudo is configured to
  use passwd (or shadow) file authentication on systems where the
  crypt() function returns `NULL` for invalid salts.
* On AIX, sudo now uses the value of the auth\_type setting
  in `/etc/security/login.cfg` to determine whether
  to use LAM or PAM for user authentication.
* The *all* setting for listpw and verifypw now works
  correctly with LDAP and sssd sudoers.
* The sudo timestamp directory is now created at boot time on
  platforms that use systemd.
* Sudo will now restore the value of the `SIGPIPE` handler before
  executing the command.
* Sudo now uses `struct timespec` instead of
  `struct timeval` for time keeping when possible. If
  supported, sudoedit and visudo now use nanosecond granularity
  time stamps.
* Fixed a symbol name collision with systems that have their
  own SHA2 implementation. This fixes a problem where PAM
  could use the wrong SHA2 implementation on Solaris 10 systems
  configured to use SHA512 for passwords.
* The editor invoked by sudoedit once again uses an unmodified
  copy of the user’s environment as per the documentation.
  This was inadvertently changed in sudo 1.8.0.
  [Bug #688](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=688).

---

## Sudo 1.8.12

* The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.8 and
  is now installed as a shared library where supported.
* Debug settings for the sudo front end and sudoers plugin are now
  configured separately.
* Multiple sudo.conf Debug entries may now be specified per program
  (or plugin).
* The plugin API has been extended such that the path to the plugin
  that was loaded is now included in the settings array. This
  path can be used to register with the debugging subsystem. The
  debug\_flags setting is now prefixed with a file name and may be
  specified multiple times if there is more than one matching Debug
  setting in sudo.conf.
* The sudoers regression tests now run with the locale set to C
  since some of the tests compare output that includes locale-specific
  messages.
  [Bug #672](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=672).
* Fixed a bug where sudo would not run commands on Linux when
  compiled with audit support if audit is disabled.
  [Bug #671](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=671).
* Added `__BASH_FUNC` to the environment blacklist to match
  Apple’s syntax for newer-style bash functions.
* The default password prompt now includes a trailing space after
  “Password:” for consistency with su(1) on most systems.
  [Bug #663](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=663).
* Fixed a problem on DragonFly BSD where `SIGCHLD` could be ignored,
  preventing sudo from exiting.
  [Bug #676](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=676).
* Visudo will now use the optional `sudoers_file`,
  `sudoers_mode`, `sudoers_uid` and
  `sudoers_gid` arguments if specified on the sudoers.so
  Plugin line in the sudo.conf file.
* Fixed a problem introduced in sudo 1.8.8 that prevented the full
  host name from being used when the *fqdn* sudoers option is used.
  [Bug #678](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=678).
* French and Russian translations for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Sudo now installs a handler for `SIGCHLD` signal handler immediately
  before stating the process that will execute the command (or
  start the monitor). The handler used to be installed earlier
  but this causes problems with poorly behaved PAM modules that
  install their own `SIGCHLD` signal handler and neglect to restore
  sudo’s original handler.
  [Bug #657](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=657).
* Removed a limit on the length of command line arguments
  expanded by a wild card using sudo’s version of the
  `fnmatch`() function. This limit was introduced
  when sudo’s version of `fnmatch`() was replaced in
  sudo 1.8.4.
* LDAP-based sudoers can now query an LDAP server for a user’s
  netgroups directly. This is often much faster than fetching
  every sudoRole object containing a sudoUser that begins with a
  `+’ prefix and checking whether the user is a member of any of
  the returned netgroups.
* The mail\_always sudoers option no longer sends mail for
  `sudo -l` or `sudo -v` unless the user is unable
  to authenticate themselves.
* Fixed a crash when sudo is run with an empty argument vector.
* Fixed two potential crashes when sudo is run with very low
  resource limits.
* The TZ environment variable is now checked for safety instead
  of simply being copied to the environment of the command.
  This fixes a potential [security issue](/security/advisories/tz).

---

## Sudo 1.8.11p2

* Fixed a bug where dynamic shared objects loaded from a plugin
  could use the hooked version of `getenv()` but not
  the hooked versions of `putenv()`, `setenv()`
  or `unsetenv()`. This can cause problems for PAM
  modules that use those functions.

---

## Sudo 1.8.11p1

* Fixed a compilation problem on some systems when the
  `--disable-shared-libutil` configure option was specified.
* The user can no longer interrupt the sleep after an incorrect
  password on PAM systems using pam\_unix.
  [Bug #666](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=666).
* Fixed a compilation problem on Linux systems that do not use PAM.
  [Bug #667](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=667).
* `make install` will now work with the stock GNU autotools
  install-sh script.
  [Bug #669](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=669).
* Fixed a crash with `sudo -i` when the current working directory
  does not exist.
  [Bug #670](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=670).
* Fixed a potential crash in the debug subsystem when logging a message
  larger that 1024 bytes.
* Fixed a `make check` failure for ttyname when stdin is closed and
  stdout and stderr are redirected to a different tty.
  [Bug #643](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=643).
* Added BASH\_FUNC\_\* to environment blacklist to match newer-style
  bash functions.

---

## Sudo 1.8.11

* The sudoers plugin no longer uses setjmp/longjmp to recover
  from fatal errors. All errors are now propagated to the caller
  via return codes.
* When running a command in the background, sudo will now forward
  `SIGINFO` to the command (if supported).
* Sudo will now use the system versions of the sha2 functions from
  libc or libmd if available.
* Visudo now works correctly on GNU Hurd.
  [Bug #647](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=647).
* Fixed suspend and resume of curses programs on some system when
  the command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal.
  [Bug #649](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=649).
* Fixed a crash with LDAP-based sudoers on some systems when
  Kerberos was enabled.
* Sudo now includes optional Solaris audit support.
* Catalan translation for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Norwegian Bokmaal translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Greek translation for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* The sudo source tree has been reorganized to more closely resemble
  that of other gettext-enabled packages.
* Sudo and its associated programs now link against a shared version
  of libsudo\_util. The `--disable-shared-libutil` configure option
  may be used to force static linking if the `--enable-static-sudoers`
  option is also specified.
* The passwords in ldap.conf and ldap.secret may now be encoded
  in base64.
* Audit updates. SELinux role changes are now audited. For
  sudoedit, we now audit the actual editor being run, instead of
  just the sudoedit command.
* Fixed bugs in the man page post-processing that could cause
  portions of the manuals to be removed.
* Fixed a crash in the system\_group plugin.
  [Bug #653](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=653).
* Fixed sudoedit on platforms without a native version of the
  getprogname() function.
  [Bug #654](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=654).
* Fixed compilation problems with some pre-C99 compilers.
* Fixed sudo’s -C option which was broken in version 1.8.9.
* It is now possible to match an environment variable’s value as
  well as its name using *env\_keep* and *env\_check*.
  This can be used to preserve bash functions which would otherwise
  be removed from the environment.
* New files created via sudoedit as a non-root user now have the
  proper group id.
  [Bug #656](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=656).
* Sudoedit now works correctly in conjunction with sudo’s SELinux
  RBAC support. Temporary files are now created with the proper
  security context.
* The sudo I/O logging plugin API has been updated. If a logging
  function returns an error, the command will be terminated and
  all of the plugin’s logging functions will be disabled. If a
  logging function rejects the command’s output it will no longer
  be displayed to the user’s terminal.
* Fixed a compilation error on systems that lack openpty(), \_getpty()
  and grantpt().
  [Bug #660](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=660).
* Fixed a hang when a sudoers source is listed more than once in
  a single sudoers nsswitch.conf entry.
* On AIX, shell scripts without a #! magic number are now passed to
  `/usr/bin/sh`, not `/usr/bin/bsh`. This is
  consistent with what the execvp() function on AIX does and
  matches historic sudo behavior.
  [Bug #661](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=661).
* Fixed a cross-compilation problem building mksiglist and mksigname.
  [Bug #662](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=662).

---

## Sudo 1.8.10p3

* Fixed expansion of the `%p` escape in the prompt for
  `sudo -l` when rootpw, runaspw or targetpw is set.
  [Bug #639](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=639).
* Fixed matching of uids and gids which was broken in version 1.8.9.
  [Bug #640](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=640).
* PAM credential initialization has been re-enabled. It was
  unintentionally disabled by default in version 1.8.8. The way
  credentials are initialized has also been fixed.
  [Bug #642](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=642).
* Fixed a descriptor leak on Linux when determining boot time. Sudo
  normally closes extra descriptors before running a command so
  the impact is limited.
  [Bug #645](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=645).
* Fixed flushing of the last buffer of data when I/O logging is
  enabled. This bug, introduced in version 1.8.9, could cause
  incomplete command output on some systems.
  [Bug #646](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=646).

---

## Sudo 1.8.10p2

* Fixed a hang introduced in sudo 1.8.10 when timestamp\_timeout
  is set to zero.
  [Bug #638](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=638).

---

## Sudo 1.8.10p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.10 that prevented the disabling
  of tty-based tickets.
* Fixed a bug with netgated commands in `sudo -l command` that
  could cause the command to be listed even when it was explicitly
  denied. This only affected list mode when a command was specified.
  [Bug #636](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=636).

---

## Sudo 1.8.10

* It is now possible to disable network interface probing in
  sudo.conf by changing the value of the *probe\_interfaces*
  setting.
* When listing a user’s privileges (sudo -l), the sudoers plugin
  will now prompt for the user’s password even if the *targetpw*,
  *rootpw* or *runaspw* options are set.
* The sudoers plugin uses a new format for its time stamp files.
  Each user now has a single file which may contain multiple records
  when per-tty time stamps are in use (the default). The time
  stamps use a monotonic timer where available and are once again
  located in a directory under `/var/run`. The lecture status is
  now stored separately from the time stamps in a different directory.
  [Bug #616](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=616).
* sudo’s -K option will now remove all of the user’s time stamps,
  not just the time stamp for the current terminal. The -k option
  can be used to only disable time stamps for the current terminal.
* If sudo was started in the background and needed to prompt for
  a password, it was not possible to suspend it at the password
  prompt. This now works properly.
* LDAP-based sudoers now uses a default search filter of
  `(objectClass=sudoRole)` for more efficient queries.
  The netgroup query has been modified to avoid falling below
  the minimum length for OpenLDAP substring indices.
* The new *use\_netgroups* sudoers option can be used to explicitly
  enable or disable netgroups support. For LDAP-based sudoers,
  netgroup support requires an expensive substring match on the
  server. If netgroups are not needed, this option can be disabled
  to reduce the load on the LDAP server.
* Sudo is once again able to open the sudoers file when the group
  on sudoers doesn’t match the expected value, so long as the file
  is not group writable.
* Sudo now installs an init.d script to clear the time stamp
  directory at boot time on AIX and HP-UX systems. These systems
  either lack `/var/run` or do not clear it on boot.
* The JSON format used by `visudo -x` now properly supports the
  negation operator. In addition, the Options object is now the
  same for both Defaults and Cmnd\_Specs.
* Czech and Serbian translations for sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Catalan translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).

---

## Sudo 1.8.9p5

* Fixed a compilation error on AIX when LDAP support is enabled.
* Fixed parsing of the *umask* defaults setting in sudoers.
  [Bug #632](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=632).
* Fixed a failed assertion when the *closefrom\_override* defaults
  setting is enabled in sudoers and sudo’s -C flag is used.
  [Bug #633](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=633).

---

## Sudo 1.8.9p4

* Fixed a bug where sudo could consume large amounts of CPU while
  the command was running when I/O logging is not enabled.
  [Bug #631](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=631).
* Fixed a bug where sudo would exit with an error when the debug
  level is set to `util@debug` or `all@debug` and
  I/O logging is not enabled. The command would continue running
  after sudo exited.

---

## Sudo 1.8.9p3

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.9 that prevented the tty name
  from being resolved properly on Linux systems.
  [Bug #630](https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=630).

---

## Sudo 1.8.9p2

* Updated config.guess, config.sub and libtool to support the
  ppc64le architecture (IBM PowerPC Little Endian).

---

## Sudo 1.8.9p1

* Fixed a problem with gcc 4.8’s handling of bit fields that
  could lead to the noexec flag being enabled even when it
  was not explicitly set.

---

## Sudo 1.8.9

* Reworked sudo’s main event loop to use a simple event subsystem
  using `poll(2)` or `select(2)` as the back end.
* It is now possible to statically compile the *sudoers* plugin
  into the sudo binary without disabling shared library support. The
  sudo.conf file may still be used to configure other plugins.
* Sudo can now be compiled again with a C preprocessor that does
  not support variadic macros.
* Visudo can now export a sudoers file in JSON format using the
  new `-x` flag.
* The locale is now set correctly again for `visudo` and
  `sudoreplay`.
* The plugin API has been extended to allow the plugin to exclude
  specific file descriptors from the *closefrom* range.
* There is now a workaround for a Solaris-specific problem where
  `NOEXEC` was overriding traditional root DAC behavior.
* Add user netgroup filtering for SSSD. Previously, rules for
  a netgroup were applied to all even when they did not belong
  to the specified netgroup.
* On systems with BSD login classes, if the user specified a group
  (not a user) to run the command as, it was possible to specify
  a different login class even when the command was not run as the
  super user.
* The `closefrom()` emulation on Mac OS X now uses
  `/dev/fd` if possible.
* Fixed a bug where `sudoedit` would not update the original
  file from the temporary when PAM or I/O logging is not enabled.
* When recycling I/O logs, the log files are now truncated properly.
* Fixes bugs #617, #621, #622, #623, #624, #625, #626

---

## Sudo 1.8.8

* Removed a warning on PAM systems with stacked auth modules
  where the first module on the stack does not succeed.
* Sudo, sudoreplay and visudo now support GNU-style long options.
* The `-h` (`--host`) option may now be used to specify
  a host name. This is currently only used by the sudoers plugin in
  conjunction with the `-l` (`--list`) option.
* Program usage messages and manual *SYNOPSIS* sections have been
  simplified.
* Sudo’s LDAP SASL support now works properly with Kerberos.
  Previously, the SASL library was unable to locate the user’s
  credential cache.
* It is now possible to set the nproc resource limit to unlimited
  via pam\_limits on Linux (bug #565).
* New *pam\_service* and *pam\_login\_service* sudoers
  options that can be used to specify the PAM service name to use.
* New *pam\_session* and *pam\_setcred* sudoers options that
  can be used to disable PAM session and credential support.
* The sudoers plugin now properly supports UIDs and GIDs
  that are larger than 0x7fffffff on 32-bit platforms.
* Fixed a visudo bug introduced in sudo 1.8.7 where per-group
  Defaults entries would cause an internal error.
* If the *tty\_tickets* sudoers option is enabled (the default),
  but there is no tty present, sudo will now use a ticket file
  based on the parent process ID. This makes it possible to support
  the normal timeout behavior for the session.
* Fixed a problem running commands that change their process
  group and then attempt to change the terminal settings when not
  running the command in a pseudo-terminal. Previously, the process
  would receive `SIGTTOU` since it was effectively a background
  process. Sudo will now grant the child the controlling tty and
  continue it when this happens.
* The *closefrom\_override* sudoers option may now be used in
  a command-specified Defaults entry (bug #610).
* Sudo’s BSM audit support now works on Solaris 11.
* Brazilian Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Czech translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* French translation for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Sudo’s noexec support on Mac OS X 10.4 and above now uses dynamic
  symbol interposition instead of setting `DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1`
  which causes issues with some programs.
* Fixed visudo’s `-q` (`--quiet`) flag,
  broken in sudo 1.8.6.
* Root may no longer change its SELinux role without entering
  a password.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.7 where the indexes written
  to the I/O log timing file are two greater than they should be.
  Sudoreplay now contains a work-around to parse those files.
* In sudoreplay’s list mode, the *this* qualifier in
  *fromdate* or *todate* expressions now behaves
  more sensibly. Previously, it would often match a date
  that was “one more” than expected. For example, “this week”
  now matches the current week instead of the following week.

---

## Sudo 1.8.7

* The non-Unix group plugin is now supported when sudoers data
  is stored in LDAP.
* Sudo now uses a workaround for a locale bug on Solaris 11.0
  that prevents setuid programs like sudo from fully using locales.
* User messages are now always displayed in the user’s locale,
  even when the same message is being logged or mailed in a
  different locale.
* Log files created by sudo now explicitly have the group set
  to group ID 0 rather than relying on BSD group semantics (which
  may not be the default).
* A new *exec\_background* sudoers option can be used to initially
  run the command without read access to the terminal when running
  a command in a pseudo-tty. If the command tries to read from
  the terminal it will be stopped by the kernel (via `SIGTTIN` or
  `SIGTTOU`) and sudo will immediately restart it as the foreground
  process (if possible). This allows sudo to only pass terminal
  input to the program if the program actually is expecting it.
  Unfortunately, a few poorly-behaved programs (like `su` on most
  Linux systems) do not handle `SIGTTIN` and `SIGTTOU` properly.
* Sudo now uses an efficient group query to get all the groups
  for a user instead of iterating over every record in the group
  database on HP-UX and Solaris.
* Sudo now produces better error messages when there is an error
  in the `sudo.conf` file.
* Two new settings have been added to sudo.conf to give the admin
  better control of how group database queries are performed.
  The *group\_source* specifies how the group list for
  a user will be determined. Legal values are
  **static** (use the kernel groups list),
  **dynamic** (perform a group database query)
  and **adaptive** (only perform a group database
  query if the kernel list is full). The *max\_groups*
  setting specifies the maximum number of groups a user may belong
  to when performing a group database query.
* The `sudo.conf` file now supports line continuation by using a
  backslash as the last character on the line.
* There is now a standalone sudo.conf manual page.
* Sudo now stores its libexec files in a `sudo`
  subdirectory instead of in libexec itself. For backwards
  compatibility, if the plugin is not found in the default
  plugin directory, sudo will check the parent directory if
  the default directory ends in `/sudo`.
* The sudoers I/O logging plugin now logs the terminal size.
* A new sudoers option *maxseq* can be used to limit the
  number of I/O log entries that are stored.
* The *system\_group* and *group\_file* sudoers group
  provider plugins are now installed by default.
* The list output (`sudo -l`) output from the sudoers
  plugin is now less ambiguous when an entry includes different
  runas users. The long list output (`sudo -ll`) for
  file-based sudoers is now more consistent with the format
  of LDAP-based sudoers.
* A uid may now be used in the sudoRunAsUser attributes for LDAP
  sudoers.
* Minor plugin API change: the close and version functions are now
  optional. If the policy plugin does not provide a close function
  and the command is not being run in a new pseudo-tty, sudo may
  now execute the command directly instead of in a child process.
* A new sudoers option *pam\_session* can be used to disable
  sudo’s PAM session support.
* On HP-UX systems, sudo will now use the `pstat()` function
  to determine the tty instead of `ttyname()`.
* Turkish translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Dutch translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Tivoli Directory Server client libraries may now be used with
  HP-UX where libibmldap has a hidden dependency on libCsup.
* The sudoers plugin will now ignore invalid domain names when
  checking netgroup membership. Most Linux systems use the string
  “(none)” for the NIS-style domain name instead of an empty string.
* New support for specifying a SHA-2 digest along with the command
  in sudoers. Supported hash types are sha224, sha256, sha384 and
  sha512. See the description of Digest\_Spec in the sudoers manual
  or the description of sudoCommand in the sudoers.ldap manual for
  details.
* The paths to ldap.conf and ldap.secret may now be specified as
  arguments to the sudoers plugin in the sudo.conf file.
* Fixed potential false positives in visudo’s alias cycle detection.
* Fixed a problem where the time stamp file was being treated
  as out of date on Linux systems where the change time on the
  pseudo-tty device node can change after it is allocated.
* Sudo now only builds Position Independent Executables (PIE)
  by default on Linux systems and verifies that a trivial test
  program builds and runs.
* On Solaris 11.1 and higher, sudo binaries will now have the
  ASLR tag enabled if supported by the linker.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p8

* Terminal detection now works properly on 64-bit AIX kernels.
  This was broken by the removal of the ttyname() fallback in Sudo
  1.8.6p6. Sudo is now able to map an AIX 64-bit device number
  to the corresponding device file in /dev.
* Sudo now checks for crypt() returning NULL when performing
  passwd-based authentication.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p7

* A time stamp file with the date set to the epoch by `sudo -k`
  is now completely ignored regardless of what the local clock is
  set to. Previously, if the local clock was set to a value between
  the epoch and the time stamp timeout value, a time stamp reset
  by `sudo -k` would be considered current.

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/epoch_ticket).
* The tty-specific time stamp file now includes the session ID
  of the sudo process that created it. If a process with the same
  tty but a different session ID runs sudo, the user will now be
  prompted for a password (assuming authentication is required for
  the command).

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/tty_tickets).

## Sudo 1.8.6p6

* On systems where the controlling tty can be determined via
  `/proc` or `sysctl()`, sudo will no longer
  fall back to using `ttyname()` if the process has
  no controlling tty. This prevents sudo from using a
  non-controlling tty for logging and time stamp purposes.

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/tty_tickets).

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p5

* Fixed a potential crash in `visudo`’s alias cycle detection.
* Improved performance on Solaris when retrieving the group list
  for the target user. On systems with a large number of groups
  where the group database is not local (NIS, LDAP, AD), fetching
  the group list could take a minute or more.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p4

* The `-fstack-protector` is now used when linking visudo,
  sudoreplay and testsudoers.
* Avoid building PIE binaries on FreeBSD/ia64 as they don’t run
  properly.
* Fixed a crash in visudo strict mode when an unknown Defaults
  setting is encountered.
* Do not inform the user that the command was not permitted by the
  policy if they do not successfully authenticate. This is a
  regression introduced in sudo 1.8.6.
* Allow sudo to be build with sss support without also including
  ldap support.
* Fix running commands that need the terminal in the background
  when I/O logging is enabled. E.g. `sudo vi &amp;`.
  When the command is foregrounded, it will now resume properly.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p3

* Fixed post-processing of the man pages on systems with legacy
  versions of sed.
* Fixed `sudoreplay -l` on Linux systems with file systems
  that set `DT_UNKNOWN` in the d\_type field of struct dirent.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p2

* Fixed suspending a command after it has already been resumed
  once when I/O logging (or use\_pty) is not enabled.
  This was a regression introduced in version 1.8.6.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6p1

* Fixed the setting of `LOGNAME`, `USER` and `USERNAME` variables in the
  command’s environment when env\_reset is enabled (the default).
  This was a regression introduced in version 1.8.6.
* Sudo now honors “SUCCESS=return” in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.

---

## Sudo 1.8.6

* Sudo is now built with the `-fstack-protector` flag
  if the the compiler supports it. Also, the `-zrelro`
  linker flag is used if supported. The `--disable-hardening`
  configure option can be used to build sudo without stack
  smashing protection.
* Sudo is now built as a Position Independent Executable (PIE)
  if supported by the compiler and linker.
* If the user is a member of the *exempt* group in
  sudoers, they will no longer be prompted for a password
  even if the `-k` flag is specified with the command.
  This makes `sudo -k command` consistent with the
  behavior one would get if the user ran `sudo -k`
  immediately before running the command.
* The sudoers file may now be a symbolic link. Previously, sudo
  would refuse to read sudoers unless it was a regular file.
* The sudoreplay command can now properly replay sessions where
  no tty was present.
* The sudoers plugin now takes advantage of symbol visibility
  controls when supported by the compiler or linker. As a result,
  only a small number of symbols are exported which significantly
  reduces the chances of a conflict with other shared objects.
* Improved support for the Tivoli Directory Server LDAP client
  libraries. This includes support for using LDAP over SSL
  (ldaps) as well as support for the `BIND_TIMELIMIT`,
  `TLS_KEY` and `TLS_CIPHERS` ldap.conf options.
  A new ldap.conf option, `TLS_KEYPW` can be used to
  specify a password to decrypt the key database.
* When constructing a time filter for use with LDAP sudoNotBefore
  and sudoNotAfter attributes, the current time now includes tenths
  of a second. This fixes a problem with timed entries on Active
  Directory.
* If a user fails to authenticate and the command would be rejected
  by sudoers, it is now logged with *command not allowed*
  instead of *N incorrect password attempts*. Likewise,
  the *mail\_no\_perms* sudoers option now takes precedence
  over *mail\_badpass*
* The sudo manuals are now formatted using the mdoc macros. Versions
  using the legacy man macros are provided for systems that lack mdoc.
* New support for Solaris privilege sets. This makes it possible
  to specify fine-grained privileges in the sudoers file on
  Solaris 10 and above. A *Runas\_Spec* that contains
  no *Runas\_Lists* can be used to give a user the
  ability to run a command as themselves but with an expanded
  privilege set.
* Fixed a problem with the reboot and shutdown commands on some
  systems (such as HP-UX and BSD). On these systems, reboot
  sends all processes (except itself) `SIGTERM`. When
  sudo received `SIGTERM`, it would relay it to the
  reboot process, thus killing reboot before it had a chance
  to actually reboot the system.
* Support for using the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) as
  a source of sudoers data.
* Slovenian translation for sudo and sudoers from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Visudo will now warn about unknown Defaults entries that are
  per-host, per-user, per-runas or per-command.
* Fixed a race condition that could cause sudo to receive
  `SIGTTOU` (and stop) when resuming a shell that was
  run via sudo when I/O logging (and *use\_pty*) is not
  enabled.
* Sending `SIGTSTP` directly to the sudo process will
  now suspend the running command when I/O logging (and
  *use\_pty*) is not enabled.

---

## Sudo 1.8.5p3

* Fixed the loading of I/O plugins that conform to a plugin API
  version older than 1.2.

---

## Sudo 1.8.5p2

* Fixed use of the `SUDO_ASKPASS` environment variable which was
  broken in Sudo 1.8.5.
* Fixed a problem reading the sudoers file when the file mode is
  more restrictive than the expected mode. For example, when the
  expected sudoers file mode is 0440 but the actual mode is 0400.

---

## Sudo 1.8.5p1

* Fixed a bug that prevented files in an include directory
  from being evaluated.

---

## Sudo 1.8.5

* When *noexec* is enabled, sudo\_noexec.so will now be prepended
  to any existing `LD_PRELOAD` variable instead of replacing it.
* The sudo\_noexec.so shared library now wraps the execvpe(),
  exect(), posix\_spawn() and posix\_spawnp() functions.
* The user/group/mode checks on sudoers files have been relaxed.
  As long as the file is owned by the sudoers uid, not world-writable
  and not writable by a group other than the sudoers gid, the file
  is considered OK. Note that visudo will still set the mode to
  the value specified at configure time.
* It is now possible to specify the sudoers path, uid, gid and
  file mode as options to the plugin in the sudo.conf file.
* Croatian, Galician, German, Lithuanian, Swedish and Vietnamese
  translations from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* `/etc/environment` is no longer read directly on Linux systems
  when PAM is used. Sudo now merges the PAM environment into the
  user’s environment which is typically set by the pam\_env module.
* The initial environment created when env\_reset is in effect
  now includes the contents of `/etc/environment` on
  AIX systems and the *setenv* and *path* entries from
  `/etc/login.conf` on BSD systems.
* The plugin API has been extended in three ways. First, options
  specified in sudo.conf after the plugin pathname are passed to
  the plugin’s open function. Second, sudo has limited support
  for hooks that can be used by plugins. Currently, the hooks are
  limited to environment handling functions. Third, the init\_session
  policy plugin function is passed a pointer to the user environment
  which can be updated during session setup. The plugin API version
  has been incremented to version 1.2. See the sudo\_plugin manual
  for more information.
* The policy plugin’s init\_session function is now called by the
  parent sudo process, not the child process that executes the
  command. This allows the PAM session to be open and closed in
  the same process, which some PAM modules require.
* Fixed parsing of “Path askpass” and “Path noexec” in sudo.conf,
  which was broken in version 1.8.4.
* On systems with an SVR4-style `/proc` file system, the
  `/proc/pid/psinfo` file is now uses to determine the
  controlling terminal, if possible. This allows tty-based
  tickets to work properly even when, e.g. standard input,
  output and error are redirected to `/dev/null`.
* The output of `sudoreplay -l` is now sorted by file name (or
  sequence number). Previously, entries were displayed in the
  order in which they were found on the file system.
* Sudo now behaves properly when I/O logging is enabled and the
  controlling terminal is revoked (e.g. the running sshd is killed).
  Previously, sudo may have exited without calling the I/O plugin’s
  close function which can lead to an incomplete I/O log.
* Sudo can now detect when a user has logged out and back in again
  on Solaris 11, just like it can on Solaris 10.
* The built-in zlib included with Sudo has been upgraded to version
  1.2.6.
* Setting the SSL parameter to start\_tls in ldap.conf now works
  properly when using Mozilla-based SDKs that support the
  ldap\_start\_tls\_s() function.
* The `TLS_CHECKPEER` parameter in ldap.conf now works when the
  Mozilla NSS crypto backend is used with OpenLDAP.
* A new group provider plugin, system\_group, is included which
  performs group look ups by name using the system groups database.
  This can be used to restore the pre-1.7.3 sudo group lookup
  behavior.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4p5

* Fixed a potential [security issue](/security/advisories/netmask)
  in the matching of hosts against an IPv4 network specified
  in sudoers. The flaw may allow a user who is authorized
  to run commands on hosts belonging to one IPv4 network to
  run commands on a different host.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4p4

* Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 which prevented
  `sudo -v` from working.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4p3

* Fixed a crash on FreeBSD when there is no tty present.
* When visudo is run with the -c (check) option, the sudoers
  file(s) owner and mode are now also checked unless the -f option
  was specified.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4p2

* Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 where insufficient space
  was allocated for group IDs in the LDAP filter.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 where the path to sudo.conf
  was `/sudo.conf` instead of `etc/sudo.conf`.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 which could cause a hang
  when I/O logging is enabled and input is from a pipe or file.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4p1

* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.4 that broke adding to or
  deleting from the *env\_keep*, \_env\_chec\_k and
  \_env\_delet\_e lists in sudoers on some platforms.

---

## Sudo 1.8.4

* The `-D` flag in sudo has been replaced with a more
  general debugging framework that is configured in sudo.conf.
* Fixed a false positive in visudo strict mode when aliases are
  in use.
* Fixed a crash with `sudo -i` when a runas group was
  specified without a runas user.
* The line on which a syntax error is reported in the sudoers file
  is now more accurate. Previously it was often off by a line.
* Fixed a bug where stack garbage could be printed at the end of
  the lecture when the *lecture\_file* option was enabled.
* `make install` now honors the `LINGUAS` environment
  variable.
* The `#include` and `#includedir` directives
  in sudoers now support relative paths. If the path is not
  fully qualified it is expected to be located in the same
  directory of the sudoers file that is including it.
* New Serbian and Spanish translations for sudo from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* LDAP-based sudoers may now access by group ID in addition to
  group name.
* visudo will now fix the mode on the sudoers file even if no changes
  are made unless the *-f* option is specified.
* The *use\_loginclass* sudoers option works properly again.
* On systems that use login.conf, `sudo -i` now sets
  environment variables based on login.conf.
* For LDAP-based sudoers, values in the search expression are now
  escaped as per RFC 4515.
* The plugin close function is now properly called when a login
  session is killed (as opposed to the actual command being killed).
  This can happen when an ssh session is disconnected or the
  terminal window is closed.
* The deprecated *noexec\_file* sudoers option is no longer supported.
* Fixed a race condition when I/O logging is not enabled that could
  result in tty-generated signals (e.g. control-C) being received
  by the command twice.
* If none of the standard input, output or error are connected
  to a tty device, sudo will now check its parent’s standard
  input, output or error for the tty name on systems with
  `/proc` and BSD systems that support the
  `KERN_PROC_PID` sysctl. This allows tty-based tickets
  to work properly even when, e.g. standard input, output and
  error are redirected to `/dev/null`.
* Added the `--enable-kerb5-instance` configure option
  to allow people using Kerberos V authentication to specify
  a custom instance so the principal name can be, e.g.
  “username/sudo” similar to how ksu uses “username/root”.
* Fixed a bug where a pattern like `/usr/*` included
  `/usr/bin/` in the results, which would be incorrectly
  be interpreted as if the sudoers file had specified a
  directory.
* `visudo -c` will now list any include files that were checked
  in addition to the main sudoers file when everything parses OK.
* Users that only have read-only access to the sudoers file may
  now run `visudo -c`. Previously, write permissions were
  required even though no writing is down in check-only mode.
* It is now possible to prevent the disabling of core dumps
  from within sudo itself by adding a line to the `sudo.conf`
  file like `Set disable_coredump false`.

---

## Sudo 1.8.3p2

* Fixed a [format string
  vulnerability](/security/advisories/sudo_debug) when the sudo binary (or a symbolic link to
  the sudo binary) contains printf format escapes and the -D
  (debugging) flag is used.

---

## Sudo 1.8.3p1

* Fixed a crash in the monitor process on Solaris when `NOPASSWD`
  was specified or when authentication was disabled.
* Fixed matching of a Runas\_Alias in the group section of a Runas\_Spec.

---

## Sudo 1.8.3

* Fixed expansion of `strftime()` escape sequences in the
  *log\_dir* sudoers setting.
* Esperanto, Italian and Japanese translations from
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
* Sudo will now use PAM by default on AIX 6 and higher.
* Added `--enable-werror` configure option for gcc’s `-Werror` flag.
* Visudo no longer assumes all editors support the +linenumber
  command line argument. It now uses a whitelist of editors known
  to support the option.
* Fixed matching of network addresses when a netmask is specified
  but the address is not the first one in the CIDR block.
* The configure script now check whether or not errno.h declares
  the errno variable. Previously, sudo would always declare errno
  itself for older systems that don’t declare it in errno.h.
* The `NOPASSWD` tag is now honored for denied commands too, which
  matches historic sudo behavior (prior to sudo 1.7.0).
* Sudo now honors the `DEREF` setting in ldap.conf which controls
  how alias dereferencing is done during an LDAP search.
* A symbol conflict with the pam\_ssh\_agent\_auth PAM module that
  would cause a crash been resolved.
* The inability to load a group provider plugin is no longer
  a fatal error.
* A potential crash in the utmp handling code has been fixed.
* Two PAM session issues have been resolved. In previous versions
  of sudo, the PAM session was opened as one user and closed as
  another. Additionally, if no authentication was performed, the
  PAM session would never be closed.
* Sudo will now work correctly with LDAP-based sudoers using TLS
  or SSL on Debian systems.
* The `LOGNAME`, `USER` and `USERNAME` environment
  variables are preserved correctly again in sudoedit mode.

---

## Sudo 1.8.2

* Sudo, visudo, sudoreplay and the sudoers plug-in now have
  [natural language support](/about/translations) (NLS).
  Sudo will use gettext(), if available, to display translated
  messages. This can be disabled by passing configure the
  `--disable-nls` option. All translations are coordinated via
  The Translation Project,
  [translationproject.org](https://translationproject.org).
  Sudo 1.8.2 includes translations for Basque, Chinese
  (simplified), Danish, Finish, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian.
* Plug-ins are now loaded with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag
  instead of `RTLD_LOCAL`. This fixes missing symbol
  problems in PAM modules on certain platforms, such as FreeBSD
  and SuSE Linux Enterprise.
* I/O logging is now supported for commands run in background mode
  (using sudo’s -b flag).
* Group ownership of the sudoers file is now only enforced when
  the file mode on sudoers allows group readability or writability.
* Visudo now checks the contents of an alias and warns about cycles
  when the alias is expanded.
* If the user specifees a group via sudo’s -g option that matches
  the target user’s group in the password database, it is now
  allowed even if no groups are present in the *Runas\_Spec*.
* The sudo Makefiles now have more complete dependencies which are
  automatically generated instead of being maintained manually.
* The *use\_pty* sudoers option is now correctly passed
  back to the sudo front end. This was missing in previous
  versions of sudo 1.8 which prevented *use\_pty* from
  being honored.
* *sudo -i command* now works correctly with the bash
  version 2.0 and higher. Previously, the .bash\_profile would
  not be sourced prior to running the command unless bash was
  built with `NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS` defined.
* When matching groups in the sudoers file, sudo will now match
  based on the name of the group instead of the group ID. This can
  substantially reduce the number of group lookups for sudoers
  files that contain a large number of groups.
* Multi-factor authentication is now supported on AIX.
* Added support for non-RFC 4517 compliant LDAP servers that
  require that seconds be present in a timestamp, such as
  Tivoli Directory Server.
* If the group vector is to be preserved, the PATH search for the
  command is now done with the user’s original group vector.
* For LDAP-based sudoers, the *runas\_default* sudoOption
  now works properly in a sudoRole that contains a sudoCommand.
* Spaces in command line arguments for *sudo -s* and
  *sudo -i* are now escaped with a backslash when
  checking the security policy.

---

## Sudo 1.8.1p2

* Two-character CIDR-style IPv4 netmasks are now matched correctly
  in the sudoers file.
* A build error with MIT Kerberos V has been resolved.
* A crash on HP-UX in the sudoers plugin when wildcards are
  present in the sudoers file has been resolved.
* Sudo now works correctly on Tru64 Unix again.

---

## Sudo 1.8.1p1

* Fixed a problem on AIX where sudo was unable to set the final
  uid if the PAM module modified the effective uid.
* A non-existent includedir is now treated the same as an empty
  directory and not reported as an error.
* Removed extraneous parens in LDAP filter when `sudoers_search_filter`
  is enabled that can cause an LDAP search error.
* Fixed a `make -j` problem for `make install`

---

## Sudo 1.8.1

* A new LDAP setting, sudoers\_search\_filter, has been added to
  ldap.conf. This setting can be used to restrict the set of
  records returned by the LDAP query. Based on changes from Matthew
  Thomas.
* White space is now permitted within a User\_List when used in
  conjunction with a per-user Defaults definition.
* A group ID (%#gid) may now be specified in a User\_List or Runas\_List.
  Likewise, for non-Unix groups the syntax is `%:#gid`.
* Support for double-quoted words in the sudoers file has been fixed.
  The change in 1.7.5 for escaping the double quote character
  caused the double quoting to only be available at the beginning
  of an entry.
* The fix for resuming a suspended shell in 1.7.5 caused problems
  with resuming non-shells on Linux. Sudo will now save the process
  group ID of the program it is running on suspend and restore it
  when resuming, which fixes both problems.
* A bug that could result in corrupted output in `sudo -l` has been
  fixed.
* Sudo will now create an entry in the utmp (or utmpx) file when
  allocating a pseudo-tty (e.g. when logging I/O). The *set\_utmp*
  and *utmp\_runas* sudoers file options can be used to control this.
  Other policy plugins may use the *set\_utmp* and *utmp\_user*
  entries in the command\_info list.
* The sudoers policy now stores the TSID field in the logs
  even when the *iolog\_file* sudoers option is defined to a value
  other than %{sessid}. Previously, the TSID field was only
  included in the log file when the *iolog\_file* option was set
  to its default value.
* The sudoreplay utility now supports arbitrary session IDs.
  Previously, it would only work with the base-36 session IDs
  that the sudoers plugin uses by default.
* Sudo now passes “run\_shell=true” to the policy plugin in the
  settings list when sudo’s -s command line option is specified.
  The sudoers policy plugin uses this to implement the *set\_home*
  sudoers option which was missing from sudo 1.8.0.
* The *noexec* functionality has been moved out of the sudoers
  policy plugin and into the sudo front-end, which matches the
  behavior documented in the plugin writer’s guide. As a result,
  the path to the noexec file is now specified in the sudo.conf
  file instead of the sudoers file.
* On Solaris 10, the PRIV\_PROC\_EXEC privilege is now used to
  implement the *noexec* feature. Previously, this was implemented
  via the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.
* The exit values for `sudo -l`, `sudo -v` and `sudo -l command`
  have been fixed in the sudoers policy plugin.
* The sudoers policy plugin now passes the login class, if any,
  back to the sudo front-end.
* The sudoers policy plugin was not being linked with requisite
  libraries in certain configurations.
* Sudo now parses command line arguments before loading any plugins.
  This allows `sudo -V` or `sudo -h` to work even if there is a problem
  with sudo.conf
* Plugins are now linked with the static version of libgcc to allow
  the plugin to run on a system where no shared libgcc is installed,
  or where it is installed in a different location.

---

## Sudo 1.8.0

* Sudo has been refactored to use a modular framework that can
  support third-party policy and I/O logging plugins. The default
  plugin is “sudoers” which provides the traditional sudo functionality.
  See the sudo\_plugin manual for details on the plugin API and the
  sample in the plugins directory for a simple example.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p9

* The TZ environment variable is now checked for safety instead
  of simply being copied to the environment of the command.
  This fixes a potential [security issue](/security/advisories/tz).
* Sudo now only builds Position Independent Executables (PIE)
  by default on Linux systems and verifies that a trivial test
  program builds and runs.
* On Solaris 11.1 and higher, sudo binaries will now have the
  ASLR tag enabled if supported by the linker.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p8

* Sudo’s exit code now indicates a failure if the user does not
  successfully authenticate.
* On HP-UX systems, sudo will now use the pstat() function to
  determine the tty instead of ttyname().
* Fixed compilation when `--without-iologdir` configure option is
  specified.
* On systems with BSD login classes, if the user specified a group
  (not a user) to run the command as, it was possible to specify
  a different login class even when the command was not run as the
  super user.
* The closefrom() emulation on Mac OS X now uses /dev/fd if possible.
  It also now sets the close on exec flag instead of actually
  closing the descriptors to avoid a crash in libdispatch.
* The sudoers plugin will now ignore invalid domain names when
  checking netgroup membership. Most Linux systems use the string
  “(none)” for the NIS-style domain name instead of an empty string.
* Fixed the logic when checking environment variables on the
  command line against the env\_check and env\_delete blacklists.
  This is only a problem when env\_reset is disabled in sudoers.
  This fixes a potential [security issue](/security/advisories/env_add)
  that may allow a user to run unauthorized commands when the *env\_reset* option is disabled in sudoers.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p7

* A time stamp file with the date set to the epoch by `sudo -k`
  is now completely ignored regardless of what the local clock is
  set to. Previously, if the local clock was set to a value between
  the epoch and the time stamp timeout value, a time stamp reset
  by `sudo -k` would be considered current.

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/epoch_ticket).
* Fixed the sudo exit status when `sudo -l command` is run.
  This is a regression introduced in version 1.7.10.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p6

* Fixed the restoration of `SIGINT`, `SIGQUIT` and `SIGTSTP`. This
  is a regression introduced in version 1.7.10p4.
* The tty-specific time stamp file now includes the session ID
  of the sudo process that created it. If a process with the same
  tty but a different session ID runs sudo, the user will now be
  prompted for a password (assuming authentication is required for
  the command).

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/tty_tickets).

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p5

* On systems where the controlling tty can be determined via
  `/proc` or `sysctl`(), sudo will no longer
  fall back to using `ttyname`() if the process has
  no controlling tty. This prevents sudo from using a
  non-controlling tty for logging and time stamp purposes.

  This is a potential
  [security issue](/security/advisories/tty_tickets).

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p4

* Avoid building PIE binaries on FreeBSD/ia64 as they don’t run
  properly.
* Fixed a crash in visudo strict mode when an unknown Defaults
  setting is encountered.
* Do not inform the user that the command was not permitted by the
  policy if they do not successfully authenticate. This is a
  regression introduced in sudo 1.8.6.
* Allow sudo to be build with sss support without also including
  ldap support.
* Fix running commands that need the terminal in the background
  when I/O logging is enabled. E.g. `sudo vi &amp;`.
  When the command is foregrounded, it will now resume properly.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p3

* Fixed post-processing of the man pages on systems with legacy
  versions of sed.
* Fixed `sudoreplay -l` on Linux systems with file systems
  that set `DT_UNKNOWN` in the d\_type field of struct dirent.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p2

* Fixed suspending a command after it has already been resumed
  once when I/O logging (or use\_pty) is not enabled.
  This was a regression introduced in version 1.7.10.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10p1

* Fixed the setting of `LOGNAME`, `USER` and `USERNAME` variables in the
  command’s environment when env\_reset is enabled (the default).
  This was a regression introduced in version 1.7.10.
* Sudo now honors “SUCCESS=return” in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.

---

## Sudo 1.7.10

* Sudo is now built with the `-fstack-protector` flag
  if the the compiler supports it. Also, the `-zrelro`
  linker flag is used if supported. The `--disable-hardening`
  configure option can be used to build sudo without stack
  smashing protection.
* Sudo is now built as a Position Independent Executable (PIE)
  if supported by the compiler and linker.
* If the user is a member of the *exempt* group in
  sudoers, they will no longer be prompted for a password
  even if the `-k` flag is specified with the command.
  This makes `sudo -k command` consistent with the
  behavior one would get if the user ran `sudo -k`
  immediately before running the command.
* The sudoers file may now be a symbolic link. Previously, sudo
  would refuse to read sudoers unless it was a regular file.
* The user/group/mode checks on sudoers files have been relaxed.
  As long as the file is owned by the sudoers uid, not world-writable
  and not writable by a group other than the sudoers gid, the file
  is considered OK. Note that visudo will still set the mode to
  the value specified at configure time.
* `/etc/environment` is no longer read directly on Linux systems
  when PAM is used. Sudo now merges the PAM environment into the
  user’s environment which is typically set by the pam\_env module.
* The initial environment created when env\_reset is in effect
  now includes the contents of `/etc/environment` on
  AIX systems and the *setenv* and *path* entries from
  `/etc/login.conf` on BSD systems.
* On systems with an SVR4-style `/proc` file system, the
  `/proc/pid/psinfo` file is now uses to determine the
  controlling terminal, if possible. This allows tty-based
  tickets to work properly even when, e.g. standard input,
  output and error are redirected to `/dev/null`.
* The output of `sudoreplay -l` is now sorted by file name (or
  sequence number). Previously, entries were displayed in the
  order in which they were found on the file system.
* The sudoreplay command can now properly replay sessions where
  no tty was present.
* Sudo now behaves properly when I/O logging is enabled and the
  controlling terminal is revoked (e.g. the running sshd is killed).
  Previously, sudo may have exited without calling the I/O plugin’s
  close function which can lead to an incomplete I/O log.
* Sudo can now detect when a user has logged out and back in again
  on Solaris 11, just like it can on Solaris 10.
* The built-in zlib included with Sudo has been upgraded to version
  1.2.6.
* Setting the SSL parameter to start\_tls in ldap.conf now works
  properly when using Mozilla-based SDKs that support the
  ldap\_start\_tls\_s() function.
* The `TLS_CHECKPEER` parameter in ldap.conf now works when the
  Mozilla NSS crypto backend is used with OpenLDAP.
* Improved support for the Tivoli Directory Server LDAP client
  libraries. This includes support for using LDAP over SSL
  (ldaps) as well as support for the `BIND_TIMELIMIT`,
  `TLS_KEY` and `TLS_CIPHERS` ldap.conf options.
  A new ldap.conf option, `TLS_KEYPW` can be used to
  specify a password to decrypt the key database.
* Fixed a crash introduced in version 1.7.7 when `sudo -s` is
  specified with a command.
* If a user fails to authenticate and the command would be rejected
  by sudoers, it is now logged with *command not allowed*
  instead of *N incorrect password attempts*. Likewise,
  the *mail\_no\_perms* sudoers option now takes precedence
  over *mail\_badpass*
* The sudo manuals are now formatted using the mdoc macros. Versions
  using the legacy man macros are provided for systems that lack mdoc.
* Fixed a problem with the reboot and shutdown commands on some
  systems (such as HP-UX and BSD). On these systems, reboot
  sends all processes (except itself) `SIGTERM`. When
  sudo received `SIGTERM`, it would relay it to the
  reboot process, thus killing reboot before it had a chance
  to actually reboot the system.
* Visudo will now warn about unknown Defaults entries that are
  per-host, per-user, per-runas or per-command.
* When constructing a time filter for use with LDAP sudoNotBefore
  and sudoNotAfter attributes, the current time now includes tenths
  of a second. This fixes a problem with timed entries on Active
  Directory.
* Fixed a race condition that could cause sudo to receive
  `SIGTTOU` (and stop) when resuming a shell that was
  run via sudo when I/O logging (and *use\_pty*) is not
  enabled.
* Sending `SIGTSTP` directly to the sudo process will
  now suspend the running command when I/O logging (and
  *use\_pty*) is not enabled.

---

## Sudo 1.7.9p1

* Fixed a potential [security issue](/security/advisories/netmask)
  in the matching of hosts against an IPv4 network specified
  in sudoers. The flaw may allow a user who is authorized
  to run commands on hosts belonging to one IPv4 network to
  run commands on a different host.

---

## Sudo 1.7.9

* Fixed a false positive in visudo strict mode when aliases are
  in use.
* The line on which a syntax error is reported in the sudoers file
  is now more accurate. Previously it was often off by a line.
* The `#include` and `#includedir` directives
  in sudoers now support relative paths. If the path is not
  fully qualified it is expected to be located in the same
  directory of the sudoers file that is including it.
* visudo will now fix the mode on the sudoers file even if no changes
  are made unless the *-f* option is specified.
* The *use\_loginclass* sudoers option works properly again.
* For LDAP-based sudoers, values in the search expression are now
  escaped as per RFC 4515.
* Fixed a race condition when I/O logging is not enabled that could
  result in tty-generated signals (e.g. control-C) being received
  by the command twice.
* If none of the standard input, output or error are connected
  to a tty device, sudo will now check its parent’s standard
  input, output or error for the tty name on systems with
  `/proc` and BSD systems that support the
  `KERN_PROC_PID` sysctl. This allows tty-based tickets
  to work properly even when, e.g. standard input, output and
  error are redirected to `/dev/null`.
* Fixed a bug where a pattern like `/usr/*` included
  `/usr/bin/` in the results, which would be incorrectly
  be interpreted as if the sudoers file had specified a
  directory.
* `visudo -c` will now list any include files that were checked
  in addition to the main sudoers file when everything parses OK.
* Users that only have read-only access to the sudoers file may
  now run `visudo -c`. Previously, write permissions were
  required even though no writing is down in check-only mode.

---

## Sudo 1.7.8p2

* Fixed a crash in the monitor process on Solaris when `NOPASSWD`
  was specified or when authentication was disabled.

---

## Sudo 1.7.8p1

* Fixed matching of a Runas\_Alias in the group section of a Runas\_Spec.

---

## Sudo 1.7.8

* Sudo will now use PAM by default on AIX 6 and higher.
* Added `--enable-werror` configure option for gcc’s `-Werror` flag.
* Visudo no longer assumes all editors support the +linenumber
  command line argument. It now uses a whitelist of editors known
  to support the option.
* Fixed matching of network addresses when a netmask is specified
  but the address is not the first one in the CIDR block.
* The configure script now check whether or not errno.h declares
  the errno variable. Previously, sudo would always declare errno
  itself for older systems that don’t declare it in errno.h.
* The `NOPASSWD` tag is now honored for denied commands too, which
  matches historic sudo behavior (prior to sudo 1.7.0).
* Sudo now honors the `DEREF` setting in ldap.conf which controls
  how alias dereferencing is done during an LDAP search.
* Using the -n option may in conjunction with the -v or -l option
  no longer results in a usage error.
* The `LOGNAME`, `USER` and `USERNAME` environment
  variables are preserved correctly again in sudoedit mode.

---

## Sudo 1.7.7

* I/O logging is now supported for commands run in background mode
  (using sudo’s -b flag).
* Group ownership of the sudoers file is now only enforced when
  the file mode on sudoers allows group readability or writability.
* Visudo now checks the contents of an alias and warns about cycles
  when the alias is expanded.
* If the user specifies a group via sudo’s -g option that matches
  the target user’s group in the password database, it is now
  allowed even if no groups are present in the *Runas\_Spec*.
* *sudo -i command* now works correctly with the bash version
  2.0 and higher. Previously, the .bash\_profile would not be
  sourced prior to running the command unless bash was built with
  `NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS` defined.
* Multi-factor authentication is now supported on AIX.
* Added support for non-RFC 4517 compliant LDAP servers that require
  that seconds be present in a timestamp, such as Tivoli Directory Server.
* If the group vector is to be preserved, the PATH search for the
  command is now done with the user’s original group vector.
* For LDAP-based sudoers, the *runas\_default* sudoOption now works
  properly in a sudoRole that contains a sudoCommand.
* Spaces in command line arguments for *sudo -s* and
  *sudo -i* are now escaped with a backslash when checking
  the sudoers file.

---

## Sudo 1.7.6p2

* Two-character CIDR-style IPv4 netmasks are now matched correctly
  in the sudoers file.
* A build error with MIT Kerberos V has been resolved.

---

## Sudo 1.7.6p1

* A non-existent includedir is now treated the same as an empty
  directory and not reported as an error.
* Removed extraneous parens in LDAP filter when `sudoers_search_filter`
  is enabled that can cause an LDAP search error.

---

## Sudo 1.7.6

* A new LDAP setting, sudoers\_search\_filter, has been added to
  ldap.conf. This setting can be used to restrict the set of
  records returned by the LDAP query. Based on changes from Matthew
  Thomas.
* White space is now permitted within a User\_List when used in
  conjunction with a per-user Defaults definition.
* A group ID (%#gid) may now be specified in a User\_List or Runas\_List.
  Likewise, for non-Unix groups the syntax is %:#gid.
* Support for double-quoted words in the sudoers file has been fixed.
  The change in 1.7.5 for escaping the double quote character
  caused the double quoting to only be available at the beginning
  of an entry.
* The fix for resuming a suspended shell in 1.7.5 caused problems
  with resuming non-shells on Linux. Sudo will now save the process
  group ID of the program it is running on suspend and restore it
  when resuming, which fixes both problems.
* A bug that could result in corrupted output in `sudo -l` has been
  fixed.

---

## Sudo 1.7.5

* When using visudo in check mode, a file named “-” may be used to
  check sudoers data on the standard input.
* Sudo now only fetches shadow password entries when using the
  password database directly for authentication.
* Password and group entries are now cached using the same key
  that was used to look them up. This fixes a problem when looking
  up entries by name if the name in the retrieved entry does not
  match the name used to look it up. This may happen on some systems
  that do case insensitive lookups or that truncate long names.
* GCC will no longer display warnings on glibc systems that use
  the warn\_unused\_result attribute for write(2) and other system calls.
* If a PAM account management module denies access, sudo now prints
  a more useful error message and stops trying to validate the user.
* Fixed a potential hang on idle systems when the sudo-run process
  exits immediately.
* Sudo now includes a copy of zlib that will be used on systems
  that do not have zlib installed.
* The `--with-umask-override` configure flag has been added to enable
  the *umask\_override* sudoers Defaults option at build time.
* Sudo now unblocks all signals on startup to avoid problems caused
  by the parent process changing the default signal mask.
* LDAP Sudoers entries may now specify a time period for which
  the entry is valid. This requires an updated sudoers schema
  that includes the sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter attributes.
  Support for timed entries must be explicitly enabled in the
  ldap.conf file. Based on changes from Andreas Mueller.
* LDAP Sudoers entries may now specify a sudoOrder attribute that
  determines the order in which matching entries are applied. The
  last matching entry is used, just like file-based sudoers. This
  requires an updated sudoers schema that includes the sudoOrder
  attribute. Based on changes from Andreas Mueller.
* When run as sudoedit, or when given the -e flag, sudo now treats
  command line arguments as pathnames. This means that slashes
  in the sudoers file entry must explicitly match slashes in
  the command line arguments. As a result, and entry such as:
  user ALL = sudoedit /etc/\*
  will allow editing of /etc/motd but not /etc/security/default.
* `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` is now an alias for `BIND_TIMELIMIT` in ldap.conf for
  compatibility with OpenLDAP configuration files.
* The LDAP API `TIMEOUT` parameter is now honored in ldap.conf.
* The I/O log directory may now be specified in the sudoers file.
* Sudo will no longer refuse to run if the sudoers file is writable
  by root.
* Sudo now performs command line escaping for `sudo -s` and `sudo -i`
  after validating the command so the sudoers entries do not need
  to include the backslashes.
* Logging and email sending are now done in the locale specified
  by the *sudoers\_locale* setting (“C” by default). Email send by
  sudo now includes MIME headers when “sudoers\_locale” is not “C”.
* The configure script has a new option, `--disable-env-reset`, to
  allow one to change the default for the sudoers Default setting
  *env\_reset* at compile time.
* When logging `sudo -l command`, sudo will now prepend “list "
  to the command in the log line to distinguish between an
  actual command invocation in the logs.
* Double-quoted group and user names may now include escaped double
  quotes as part of the name. Previously this was a parse error.
* Sudo once again restores the state of the signal handlers it
  modifies before executing the command. This allows sudo to be
  used with the nohup command.
* Resuming a suspended shell now works properly when I/O logging
  is not enabled (the I/O logging case was already correct).

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p6

* A bug has been fixed in the I/O logging support that could cause
  visual artifacts in full-screen programs such as text editors,.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p5

* A bug has been fixed that would allow a command to be run without the
  user entering a password when sudo’s -g flag is used without the -u flag.
* If user has no supplementary groups, sudo will now fall back on checking
  the group file explicitly, which restores historic sudo behavior.
* A crash has been fixed when sudo’s -g flag is used without the -u flag
  and the sudoers file contains an entry with no runas user or group listed.
* A crash has been fixed when the Solaris project support is enabled
  and sudo’s -g flag is used without the -u flag.
* Sudo no longer exits with an error when support for auditing is
  compiled in but auditing is not enabled.
* Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.7.3 where the ticket file was not
  being honored when the *targetpw* sudoers Defaults option was enabled.
* The `LOG_INPUT` and `LOG_OUTPUT` tags in sudoers are now parsed correctly.
* A crash has been fixed in `sudo -l` when sudo is built with auditing
  support and the user is not allowed to run any commands on the host.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p4

* A potential [security
  issue](/security/advisories/runas_group) has been fixed with respect to the handling of sudo’s
  `-g` command line option when `-u` is also specified.
  The flaw may allow an attacker to run commands as a user that is
  not authorized by the sudoers file.
* A bug has been fixed where `sudo -l` output was incomplete
  if multiple sudoers sources were defined in nsswitch.conf
  and there was an error querying one of the sources.
* The log\_input, log\_output, and use\_pty sudoers options now
  work correctly on AIX. Previously, sudo would hang if
  they were enabled.
* Fixed `make install` when sudo is built in a directory
  other than the directory that holds the sources.
* The `runas_default` sudoers setting now works properly
  in a per-command Defaults line.
* Suspending and resuming the bash shell when PAM is in use now
  works properly. The `SIGCONT` signal was not being propagated
  to the child process.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p3

* A bug has been fixed where duplicate `HOME` environment
  variables could be set when the `env_reset` setting
  was disabled and the `always_set_home` setting was
  enabled in sudoers.
* The value of sysconfdir is now substituted into the path
  to the `sudoers.d` directory in the installed
  `sudoers` file.
* Fixed compilation problems on Irix and other platforms.
* If multiple PAM “auth” actions are specified and the user
  enters ^C at the password prompt, sudo will now abort any
  subsequent “auth” actions. Previously it was necessary to
  enter ^C once for each “auth” action.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p2

* Fixed a bug where sudo could spin in a cpu loop waiting
  for the child process.
* Packaging fixes for sudo.pp to better handle patchlevels.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4p1

* Fix a bug introduced in sudo 1.7.3 that prevented the
  `-k` and `-K` options from functioning when
  the `tty_tickets` *sudoers* option was enabled.
* Sudo no longer prints a warning when the `-k` or `-K`
  options are specified and the ticket file does not exist.
* Changes to the configure script to enable cross-compilation of Sudo.

---

## Sudo 1.7.4

* Sudoedit will now preserve the file extension in the name of the
  temporary file being edited. The extension is used by some
  editors (such as emacs) to choose the editing mode.
* Time stamp files have moved from /var/run/sudo to either /var/db/sudo,
  /var/lib/sudo or /var/adm/sudo. The directories are checked for
  existence in that order. This prevents users from receiving the
  sudo lecture every time the system reboots. Time stamp files older
  than the boot time are ignored on systems where it is possible to
  determine this.
* Ancillary documentation (README files, LICENSE, etc) is now installed
  in a sudo documentation directory.
* Sudo now recognizes *tls\_cacert* as an alias for *tls\_cacertfile*
  in ldap.conf.
* Defaults settings that are tied to a user, host or command may
  now include the negation operator. For example:

  ```
  Defaults:!millert lecture

  ```

  will match any user but millert.
* The default PATH environment variable, used when no PATH variable
  exists, now includes /usr/sbin and /sbin.
* Sudo now uses [polypkg](https://github.com/OneIdentity/Polypkg)
  for cross-platform packing.
* On Linux, sudo will now restore the nproc resource limit before
  executing a command, unless the limit appears to have been modified
  by pam\_limits. This avoids a problem with bash scripts that open
  more than 32 descriptors on SuSE Linux, where `sysconf(_SC_CHILD_MAX)`
  will return -1 when `RLIMIT_NPROC` is set to `RLIMIT_UNLIMITED` (-1).
* Visudo will now treat an unrecognized Defaults entry as a
  parse error (sudo will warn but still run).
* The HOME and MAIL environment variables are now reset based on the
  target user’s password database entry when the env\_reset sudoers option
  is enabled (which is the case in the default configuration). Users
  wishing to preserve the original values should use a sudoers entry like:

  ```
  Defaults env_keep += HOME

  ```

  to preserve the old value of HOME and

  ```
  Defaults env_keep += MAIL

  ```

  to preserve the old value of MAIL.
* The tty\_tickets option is now on by default.
* Fixed a problem in the restoration of the AIX authdb registry setting.
* If PAM is in use, wait until the process has finished before closing
  the PAM session.
* Fixed `sudo -i -u user` where user has no shell listed in the
  password database.
* When logging I/O, sudo now handles pty read/write returning `ENXIO`,
  as seen on FreeBSD when the login session has been killed.
* Sudo now performs I/O logging in the C locale. This avoids
  locale-related issues when parsing floating point
  numbers in the timing file.
* Added support for Ubuntu-style admin flag dot files.

---

## Sudo 1.7.3

* Support for logging a command’s input and output as well as
  the ability to replay sessions. For more information, see
  the documentation for the `log_input` and
  `log_output` Defaults options in the sudoers manual.
  Also see the [sudoreplay manual](/docs/man/sudoreplay.man)
  for information on replaying I/O log sessions.
* The `use_pty` sudoers option can be used to force a command
  to be run in a pseudo-pty, even when I/O logging is not enabled.
* On some systems, **sudo** can now detect when a
  user has logged out and back in again when tty-based time
  stamps are in use. Supported systems include Solaris systems
  with the devices file system, Mac OS X, and Linux systems
  with the devpts filesystem (pseudo-ttys only).
* On AIX systems, the registry setting in `/etc/security/user`
  is now taken into account when looking up users and groups. Sudo
  now applies the correct the user and group ids when running a
  command as a user whose account details come from a different
  source (e.g. LDAP or DCE vs. local files).
* Support for multiple `sudoers_base` and `uri` entries in
  ldap.conf. When multiple entries are listed, sudo will try
  each one in the order in which they are specified.
* Sudo’s SELinux support should now function correctly when running
  commands as a non-root user and when one of stdin, stdout or stderr
  is not a terminal.
* Sudo will now use the Linux audit system with configure with
  the `--with-linux-audit flag`.
* Sudo now uses `mbr_check_membership()` on systems that support
  it to determine group membership. Currently, only Darwin (Mac OS X)
  supports this.
* When the `tty_tickets` sudoers option is enabled but there
  is no terminal device, sudo will no longer use or create a tty-based
  ticket file. Previously, sudo would use a tty name of “unknown”.
  As a consequence, if a user has no terminal device, sudo will
  now always prompt for a password.
* The `passwd_timeout` and `timestamp_timeout` options
  may now be specified as floating point numbers for more granular
  timeout values.
* Negating the `fqdn` option in sudoers now works correctly
  when sudo is configured with the `--with-fqdn` option.
  In previous versions of sudo the fqdn was set before sudoers
  was parsed.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p8

* Fixed a crash on AIX when LDAP support is in use.
* Fixed problems with the QAS non-Unix group support.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p7

* Fix detection of newer versions of OpenPAM.
* Sync non-Unix group support with Quest sudo git repo.
* Configure fixes: HP-UX ld uses +b instead of -R or -rpath;
  fix typo in `--with-vasgroups` check; link with `-ldl` for
  vasgroups; add missing template for `ENV_DEBUG`.
* Fix typos in README.LDAP.
* Use the value of `SHELL` from configure in the Makefile.
* Handle duplicate variables in the environment.
  For unsetenv(), keep looking even after remove the first instance.
  For sudo\_putenv(), check for and remove dupes after we replace an
  existing value.
* Fix a crash in visudo when checking a sudoers file that has aliases
  that reference themselves.
* Fix a crash in visudo when checking a sudoers file in strict mode
  when alias errors are present.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p6

* When doing a glob match, short circuit if gl\_pathc is 0.
* Fix a bug introduced with def\_closefrom. The value of
  def\_closefrom already includes the +1.
* Added a note about the security implications of the fast\_glob
  sudoers option.
* Qualify the command even if it is in the current working directory,
  e.g. “./foo” instead of just returning “foo”. This removes
  an ambiguity between real commands and possible pseudo-commands
  in command matching.
* Fix installation of sudoers.ldap in `make install` when
  `--with-ldap` was specified without a directory.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p5

* Fix size arg when realloc()ing include stack.
* Avoid a duplicate fclose() of the sudoers file.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p4

* Fix a bug that could allow users with permission to run sudoedit
  to run arbitrary commands.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p3

* Fix printing of entries with multiple host entries on
  a single line.
* Fix use after free when sending error messages via email.
* Use setrlimit64(), if available, instead of setrlimit() when
  setting AIX resource limits since rlim\_t is 32bits.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p2

* Fixed a a bug where the negation operator in a Cmnd\_List
  was not being honored.
* No longer produce a parse error when #includedir references a
  directory that contains no valid filenames.
* The sudo.man.pl and sudoers.man.pl files are now included in
  the distribution for people who wish to regenerate the man pages.
* Fixed the emulation of krb5\_get\_init\_creds\_opt\_alloc() for MIT kerberos.
* When authenticating via PAM, set `PAM_RUSER` and `PAM_RHOST` early so
  they can be used during authentication.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2p1

* Fixed the expansion of the `%h` escape in
  `#include` file names introduced in sudo 1.7.1.

---

## Sudo 1.7.2

* A new `#includedir` directive is available in sudoers.
  This can be used to implement an /etc/sudo.d directory. Files
  in an includedir are not edited by visudo unless they contain a
  syntax error.
* The -g option did not work properly when only setting the group
  (and not the user). Also, in -l mode the wrong user was displayed
  for sudoers entries where only the group was allowed to be set.
* Fixed a problem with the alias checking in visudo which
  could prevent visudo from exiting.
* Sudo will now correctly parse the shell-style /etc/environment
  file format used by pam\_env on Linux.
* When doing password and group database lookups, sudo will only
  cache an entry by name or by id, depending on how the entry was
  looked up. Previously, sudo would cache by both name and id
  from a single lookup, but this breaks sites that have multiple
  password or group database names that map to the same uid or
  gid.
* User and group names in sudoers may now be enclosed in double
  quotes to avoid having to escape special characters.
* BSM audit fixes when changing to a non-root uid.
* Experimental non-Unix group support. Currently only works with
  Quest Authorization Services and allows Active Directory groups
  fixes for Minix-3.
* For Netscape/Mozilla-derived LDAP SDKs the certificate and key
  paths may be specified as a directory or a file. However, version
  5.0 of the SDK only appears to support using a directory (despite
  documentation to the contrary). If SSL client initialization
  fails and the certificate or key paths look like they could be
  default file name, strip off the last path element and try again.
* A setenv() compatibility fix for Linux systems, where a NULL
  value is treated the same as an empty string and the variable
  name is checked against the NULL pointer.

---

## Sudo 1.7.1

* Fixed a bug in the version of `glob()` supplied with
  sudo that affected character classes and ranges.
* Fixed a `NULL` pointer dereference when the sudoers
  file mode or owner was incorrect.
* Fixed a `NULL` pointer dereference when a PAM module
  called the sudo conversation function during a phase other
  than authentication.
* Fixed an LDAP compatibility problem with the AIX LDAP libraries.
* A new Defaults option *pwfeedback* will cause sudo to provide
  visual feedback when the user is entering a password.
* A new Defaults option *fast\_glob* will cause sudo to use the
  `fnmatch()` function for file name globbing instead
  of `glob()`. When this option is enabled, sudo will
  not check the file system when expanding wildcards. This
  is faster but a side effect is that relative paths with
  wildcard will no longer work.
* New BSM audit support for systems that support it such as FreeBSD
  and Mac OS X.
* The file name specified with the `#include` directive may
  now include a %h escape which is expanded to the short form of
  hostname.
* The -k flag may now be specified along with a command, causing the
  user’s timestamp file to be ignored.
* New support for Tivoli-based LDAP `START_TLS`, present in AIX.
* New support for /etc/netsvc.conf on AIX.
* The unused alias checks in visudo now handle the case of an alias
  referring to another alias.
* A new Defaults option *umask\_override* will cause sudo to set
  the umask specified in sudoers even if it is more permissive
  than the invoking user’s umask.

---

## Sudo 1.7.0

* Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
  This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
  apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command.
  It also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.
* Sudoers now supports a `#include` facility to allow the
  inclusion of other sudoers-format files.
* Sudo’s -l (list) flag has been enhanced:

  + applicable Defaults options are now listed
  + a command argument can be specified for testing
    whether a user may run a specific command.
  + a new `-U` flag can be used in conjunction with
    `sudo -l` to allow root (or a user with
    `sudo ALL`) to list another user’s privileges.
* A new `-g` flag has been added to allow the user to specify a
  primary group to run the command as. The sudoers syntax has been
  extended to include a group section in the Runas specification.
* A uid may now be used anywhere a username is valid.
* The *secure\_path* run-time Defaults option has been restored.
* Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.
* The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
  configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.
* `visudo` will now warn about aliases that are defined but
  not used.
* The -i and -s command line flags now take an optional command
  to be run via the shell. Previously, the argument was passed
  to the shell as a script to run.
* Improved LDAP support. SASL authentication may now be used in
  conjunction when connecting to an LDAP server. The krb5\_ccname
  parameter in ldap.conf may be used to enable Kerberos.
* Support for /etc/nsswitch.conf. LDAP users may now use nsswitch.conf
  to specify the sudoers order. E.g.:

  ```
  sudoers: ldap files

  ```

  to check LDAP, then /etc/sudoers. The default is `files`,
  even when LDAP support is compiled in. This differs from sudo 1.6
  where LDAP was always consulted first.
* Support for `/etc/environment` on AIX and Linux. If sudo is
  run with the -i flag, the contents of `/etc/environment` are
  used to populate the new environment that is passed to the command
  being run.
* Sudo now ignores user .ldaprc files as well as system LDAP defaults.
  All LDAP configuration is now in `/etc/ldap.conf`
  (or whichever file was specified by configure’s
  `--with-ldap-conf-file` option).
  If you are using TLS, you may now need to specify:

  ```
  tls_checkpeer no

  ```

  in sudo’s ldap.conf unless ldap.conf references a valid certificate
  authority file(s).
* If no terminal is available or if the new `-A` flag is specified,
  sudo will use a helper program to read the password if one is
  configured. Typically, this is a graphical password prompter
  such as ssh-askpass.
* A new Defaults option, *mailfrom* that sets the value of the
  “From:” field in the warning/error mail. If unspecified, the
  login name of the invoking user is used.
* Resource limits are now set to the default value for the
  user the command is being run as on AIX systems.
* A new Defaults option, *env\_file* that refers to a file containing
  environment variables to be set in the command being run.
* A new `-n` flag is available which may be used to indicate
  that sudo should not prompt the user for a password and,
  instead, exit with an error if authentication is required.
* A new Defaults option, *sudoers\_locale* that can be used to set
  the locale to be used when parsing the sudoers file.
* sudoedit now checks the `EDITOR` and `VISUAL` environment
  variables to make sure sudoedit is not re-invoking itself
  (or sudo). This allows one to set `EDITOR` to sudoedit without
  getting into an infinite loop for programs that need to
  invoke an editor such as crontab(1). Also added `SUDO_EDITOR`
  environment variable which is used by sudoedit in preference
  to `EDITOR`/`VISUAL`.
* The versions of `glob(3)` and `fnmatch(3)` bundled
  with sudo now support POSIX character classes.
* If sudo needs to prompt for a password and it is unable to
  disable echo (and no askpass program is defined), it will
  refuse to run unless the *visiblepw* Defaults option has
  been specified.
* Prior to version 1.7.0, hitting enter/return at the Password:
  prompt would exit sudo. In sudo 1.7.0 and beyond, this is
  treated as an empty password. To exit sudo, the user must
  now press ^C or ^D at the prompt.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=894#c0)  Imre Vadász    2019-08-20 06:13:03 MDT  ``` Assuming that the default coredump size limit is a soft limit of "0" and a hard limit of "unlimited", this can be reproduced by running:   $ ulimit -c unlimited  $ ulimit -c  unlimited  $ sudo bash -c 'ulimit -c'  unlimited  Wheras the expected output would be  $ sudo bash -c 'ulimit -c'  0  This surprising change in behavior was introduced by this commit, which tries to make sure that sudo can't dump core, by using the PR_SET_DUMPABLE prctl call on Linux:  commit f57629c95308cb87da059c37722bb8b65217f318 Author: Todd C. Miller <Todd.Miller@courtesan.com> Date:   Thu Apr 27 12:28:08 2017 -0600      On Linux, if the command we ran dumped core, set PR_SET_DUMPABLE     to 0.  This will prevent sudo itself from dumping core in this case.    The problem appears to be, that disable_coredump(true) now gets called at a later point, where it actually overwrites the coredump size limits that have been set via pam_limits.so (e.g. when it applies the settings from /etc/security/limits.conf).  So at least the setrlimit(RLIMIT_CORE, &corelimit) portion of the disable_coredump(true) function call should happen at an earlier stage in the code.   As a workaround for this bug, the disable_coredump flag can be set to False in sudo.conf. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=894#c1)  Todd C. Miller    2019-08-20 07:53:48 MDT  ``` I just committed a fix for this which will be in sudo 1.8.28: <https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/f35441098234> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=894#c2)  Todd C. Miller    2019-10-14 10:36:49 MDT  ``` Fixed in sudo 1.8.28 ``` |  |

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.
