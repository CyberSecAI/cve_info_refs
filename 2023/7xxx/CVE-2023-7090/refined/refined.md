===ANALYSIS===
The provided content relates to CVE-2023-7090.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `ipa_hostname` setting in the `sudo` utility. Specifically, the `ipa_hostname` value from `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` was not being propagated to `sudo`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary weakness is the failure to propagate the `ipa_hostname` setting, leading to privilege mismanagement. This allows client hosts to retain privileges even after those privileges have been revoked.

**Impact of exploitation**:  Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to privilege mismanagement, where client hosts continue to have privileges even after they should have been retracted. This can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, and potentially denial of service.

**Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the misconfiguration in `sudo`, where the client host retains privileges due to the `ipa_hostname` not being correctly propagated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with sudo privileges on a client machine that connects to a server where the `ipa_hostname` is configured can exploit this vulnerability.
