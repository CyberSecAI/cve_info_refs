Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `book_row.php` file of the "Online College Library System" application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when querying the database, which enables injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied data.
- Lack of input validation in the `book_row.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries and perform unauthorized actions. This could include:
  - Accessing, modifying or deleting sensitive data from the database.
  - Potentially compromising the entire application and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/libsystem/admin/book_row.php`.
- The `id` parameter within the POST data is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which may require network access to the server running the application.
- Basic knowledge of HTTP and SQL injection techniques is required.
- It appears the attacker has to be logged in, since a session cookie is provided in the exploit.
