Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient validation of file uploads in the "Online Notes Sharing System 1.0". This lack of validation allows an attacker to upload a malicious file containing an XSS payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system doesn't properly check the content of uploaded files, allowing arbitrary files, including those with malicious code, to be uploaded.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The uploaded malicious PDF file contains JavaScript code that is executed when the file is viewed within the application, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, including session cookies, which could lead to account hijacking.
*   **User Session Compromise:** The attacker can compromise user sessions, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform other malicious actions within the context of the application, such as defacement, redirecting users to malicious sites, or injecting further malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the application. An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file containing an XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the "Online Notes Sharing System" to access the file upload feature at `/user/add-notes.php`.
*   **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file containing an XSS payload using JavaScript.
*   **Upload and Trigger:**  The attacker needs to upload the malicious file and then trigger the XSS by viewing the file through the "Edit" and "View" functions.
