Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7084

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress Plugin "Voting Record" version 2.0 and below

**Root Cause:**
The plugin lacks proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-provided data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when viewed by other users, including administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's data fields.
- When an administrator views the stored data (e.g., recorded votes), the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- This can lead to various consequences, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Data theft
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Further exploitation within the admin interface

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with the "subscriber" role or higher can inject the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account with at least the "subscriber" role on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to submit data through the plugin's forms.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript into fields like `description` or `voter`.
- The provided Proof of Concept shows how to craft a form that, when submitted by a subscriber, injects the XSS payload.
- The injected script is then triggered when an administrator views the record.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 8.0 (High), indicating a significant risk.
- There is no known fix for this vulnerability as of the information provided.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Ruf.
