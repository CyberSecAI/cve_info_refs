- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "Community by PeepSo" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when creating user posts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF checks, allowing attackers to create user posts on behalf of logged-in users without their consent or knowledge.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create posts on a user's wall without the user's knowledge. This could be used to spread malicious content or for other malicious purposes. The impact is a medium severity as defined in the CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious HTML page. The attacker needs no user-level or administrative-level privileges on the vulnerable site.
