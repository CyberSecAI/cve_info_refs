Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, an attacker can upload a malicious DICOM study containing an XSS payload. When a user attempts to view this infected study through the Osimis Web Viewer, the XSS vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted DICOM study containing the XSS payload through the Osimis Web Viewer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious DICOM file to the system. The attacker does not need any privileges and the attack is triggered when a user views the malicious DICOM study in the web viewer, making the attack remotely exploitable with low complexity.

The document also includes mitigations, such as updating to Orthanc version 24.1.2 or greater, and general security recommendations from CISA like network segmentation, using VPNs for remote access, and user awareness for avoiding phishing attacks.
