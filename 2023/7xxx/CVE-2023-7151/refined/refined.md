- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `page` parameter before outputting it back in an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed in the context of a user's browser session. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal session cookies, or redirect the user to a malicious website. The vulnerability is especially dangerous when an administrator opens a page with malicious code because the attacker can gain administrative privileges on the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `page` parameter that contains JavaScript code. This URL needs to be opened by a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in user, particularly a user with high privileges such as an administrator, into opening it.
