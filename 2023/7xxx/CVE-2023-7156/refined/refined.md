The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `libsystem` application. This aligns with the stated purpose of retrieving CVE descriptions.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `category` GET parameter in a SQL query without any sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The lack of input validation allows for malicious SQL code injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even gain control over the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `index.php` page, using the vulnerable `category` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

The content provides a vulnerable code snippet, a PoC HTTP request, and SQLMap command to demonstrate the vulnerability. It contains more details than the basic CVE description.
