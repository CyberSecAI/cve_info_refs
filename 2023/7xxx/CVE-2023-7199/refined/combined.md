# Premium 2.25 / Free 4.22 release notes

 by [Mikko Saari](https://www.relevanssi.com/author/mikko/)

This is a security update. A security hole was found in Relevanssi that allowed anybody to view site drafts. Versions 2.25 and 4.22 patch this hole.

## 2.25.2 / 4.22.2

* Security fix: Prevent CSV injection attack in log export. This has no effect, unless you export logs to view them in a spreadsheet app, and even there I’m not sure what damage can be done.
* Security fix: Restrict access to doc count updates. This could’ve been used as a method for denial-of-service attacks; of course, it’s just one of many such methods to attack a WordPress site, with or without Relevanssi.
* Minor fix: Product variations check the parent product for access restrictions to avoid situations where variations of a draft product appear in the results.
* Minor fix: Improved TablePress compatibility.
* Minor fix: Added error handling to the Ninja Table compatibility code.

## 2.25.1 / 4.22.1

* Security fix: Relevanssi had a vulnerability where anyone could access search and click logs. The log export is now protected.
* Minor fix: Relevanssi had problems with Polylang when a post or term didn’t specify a language. Now Relevanssi handles those situations better.
* Minor fix: Post date throttling had a MySQL error that made it replace JOINs instead of concatenating.
* Minor fix: The log database table now has an index on session\_id, as not having that index can greatly slow down the search.

## 2.25.0 / 4.22.0

* New feature: New filter hook `[relevanssi_searchform_dropdown_args](https://www.relevanssi.com/user-manual/filter-hooks/relevanssi_searchform_dropdown_args/)` filters the arguments for `wp_dropdown_categories()` in search forms.
* Changed behaviour: Search form shortcode taxonomy dropdowns are now sorted alphabetically, not by term ID.
* Minor fix: Caught a bug in excerpt-building with empty words.
* Minor fix: It’s now possible to set both `post__in` and `post__not_in` and likewise for `parent__in` and `parent__not_in`.
* Minor fix: The `post_status` is no longer available as a query parameter.

You can find the new versions from the automatic updates or the [Downloads](https://www.relevanssi.com/download/) page.
