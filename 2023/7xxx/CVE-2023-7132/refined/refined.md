- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data in the 'userName', 'firstName', 'lastName', and 'userEmail' parameters during user registration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored in the system and executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This could lead to cookie-based authentication credential theft and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker submits a crafted payload containing JavaScript code through the user registration form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the user registration page and submit the form with the malicious payload.
