Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a logical flaw in the `ScheduleController` of the `big-whale` application's admin module. Specifically, the `run` method, which is responsible for executing scheduled tasks, does not perform adequate authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `run` method fails to verify if the `id` parameter passed to it belongs to the currently logged-in user or a super administrator. This allows any user to potentially manipulate the `id` parameter to access scheduled tasks belonging to other users.
*   **Data Exposure:** By exploiting the missing authorization, attackers can access and potentially steal sensitive information related to other users' application forms via the `/auth/user/all.api` endpoint. This includes the super administrator's application data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within application forms belonging to other users, including administrators. This could expose personal data, business secrets, or other confidential information.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal the application data from other users by accessing the `/auth/user/all.api` endpoint.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Though not explicitly stated, access to the super administrator's application data could potentially lead to privilege escalation within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the `id` parameter in the request sent to the vulnerable `run` method. This is done without needing to compromise any other account.
*   **API Endpoint Exploitation:** The issue specifically allows using the `/auth/user/all.api` API to obtain sensitive information of other users by crafting malicious requests to the `run` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account within the `big-whale` application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** Attackers need to know the vulnerable endpoint (`run` method in `ScheduleController`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
