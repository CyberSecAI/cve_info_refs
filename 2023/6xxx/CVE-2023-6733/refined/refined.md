### Summary of CVE-2023-6733

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing authorization check in the `wpmem_field` shortcode within the WP-Members Membership Plugin. This allows authenticated users with contributor access or higher to access sensitive user data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to user data through the `wpmem_field` shortcode. The shortcode allows retrieval of user data without checking for proper authorization.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive data, including user emails, password hashes, usernames, and potentially other user-related information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can extract sensitive user information, potentially leading to account compromise, identity theft, or other malicious activities.
*   The impact is high due to the exposure of password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited via the `wpmem_field` shortcode, which can be included in any content where shortcodes are processed (posts, pages, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to create content that includes shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `wpmem_field` shortcode, when used with a specific field attribute (e.g., `[wpmem_field field="user_email"]`) can be abused to retrieve data of the specified field.
*   The shortcode fails to perform adequate checks on who is requesting the information, allowing any authenticated user to potentially access another user's data via the `id` attribute (e.g., `[wpmem_field field="user_email" id="2"]`).
*   The fix involves implementing checks to restrict the usage of the `wpmem_field` shortcode to users with the "list\_users" capability, unless explicitly set to be fully enabled, and adding a filter (`wpmem_field_sc_meta_keys`) to control which meta keys are allowed to be displayed via the shortcode.
*   The plugin now has options to disable the shortcode fully, partially (list users capability), or fully enabled

This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.4.9 of the WP-Members Membership plugin.
