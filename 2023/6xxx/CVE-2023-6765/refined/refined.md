{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application constructs a SQL query using unvalidated input from the `name` parameter in `email_setup.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify the SQL query, potentially leading to arbitrary SQL command execution, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious POST request to `admin/email_setup.php`, injecting SQL code in the `name` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application, and no special privileges are mentioned as a prerequisite. The attack can be performed remotely."
