Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ekit_widgetarea_content` function within the `elementskit-lite` plugin. This function was accessible via AJAX requests (`wp_ajax_ekit_widgetarea_content` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_ekit_widgetarea_content`), allowing both logged-in and unauthenticated users to trigger it.
*   The function retrieves and displays content of posts based on the `post_id` parameter provided in the AJAX request. The vulnerability stems from the fact that it retrieves content without proper authorization checks, making it possible to access the content of posts in draft, private, or pending review status.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control on the `ekit_widgetarea_content` function. It fails to verify if the requesting user has permissions to view the content of the requested post.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to sensitive information exposure by leaking the content of unpublished posts, potentially revealing confidential or unfinished material.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can access the content of any post created with Elementor, regardless of its published status. This includes content that should be private, in draft, or pending review.
*   This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, intellectual property, or future plans, depending on the nature of the unpublished content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through AJAX requests to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint, using the `ekit_widgetarea_content` action.
*   Attackers can craft malicious AJAX requests containing a `post_id` parameter to target specific posts they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker doesn't need any special capabilities or privileged position. They only need the ability to send HTTP requests to a WordPress site with the vulnerable plugin installed.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the vulnerable AJAX actions in version 3.0.4 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `elementskit-lite/modules/controls/widget-area-utils.php`.
*   The fix involved removing the following actions `add_action( 'wp_ajax_ekit_widgetarea_content', array( $this, 'ekit_widgetarea_content' ) )` and `add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_ekit_widgetarea_content', array( $this, 'ekit_widgetarea_content' ) );`
