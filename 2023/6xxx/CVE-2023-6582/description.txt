The ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.3 via the ekit_widgetarea_content function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain contents of posts in draft, private or pending review status that should not be visible to the general public. This applies to posts created with Elementor only.
