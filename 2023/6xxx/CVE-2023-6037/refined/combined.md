## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP TripAdvisor Review Slider < 11.9 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Get TripAdvisor Reviews option and search for: `"autofocus onfocus=alert(1)//`
2. Reenter the Get TripAdvisor Reviews option and an XSS will be shown. It will also display on the frontend.
