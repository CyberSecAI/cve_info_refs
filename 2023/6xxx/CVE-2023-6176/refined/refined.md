{
  "CVE-2023-6176": {
    "description": "The value of rec_seq of tls_crypto_info configured by the user program is too large, for example, 0xffffffffffffff. In addition, TLS is asynchronously accelerated. When tls_do_encryption() returns -EINPROGRESS and sk->sk_err is set to EBADMSG due to rec_seq overflow, skmsg is released before the asynchronous encryption process ends. As a result, the UAF problem occurs during the asynchronous processing of the encryption module.",
    "root_cause": "A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability occurs due to a race condition between the release of the skmsg and the asynchronous encryption process when a large rec_seq is provided, leading to a null pointer dereference when accessing the freed memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A local Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to the null-pointer dereference, which can crash the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user can create a network packet with a specific socket configuration and a large rec_seq value to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to configure the socket and send the malicious packets to trigger the UAF and crash the kernel."
