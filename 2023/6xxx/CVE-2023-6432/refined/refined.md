  "CVE-2023-6432": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sufficiently encode user-controlled input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient encoding of user input.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can store malicious JavaScript payloads within the system. These payloads will execute when a user loads the affected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `/inventory/items_view.php` file, specifically through the `FirstRecord` parameter. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into this parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious input into the `FirstRecord` parameter of the `/inventory/items_view.php` file. No specific privileges are mentioned, implying that it could be possible for unauthenticated users, although this is not explicitly stated."
