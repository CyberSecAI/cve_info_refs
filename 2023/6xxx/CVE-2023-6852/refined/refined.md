The provided content is a commit diff for KodExplorer, version 4.52.01. The commit message indicates a "security issue fix", but the specific vulnerability is not explicitly stated. However, changes in the code provide clues:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit addresses a potential vulnerability related to file handling and access control, specifically in the `app/controller/api.class.php`, `app/function/file.function.php`, and `app/function/helper.function.php` files.
- There are changes in `api.class.php` related to `apiKey` checks, `file.function.php` regarding file extension handling, and `helper.function.php` with changes to how file paths are hashed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Insecure API key usage:** The change in `api.class.php` suggests that previously, the API key check might have been insufficient. Specifically, it seems like the `show_tips` was being called regardless of the `apiKey` being present or not, which could have allowed unauthorized access.
2. **Insecure file extension handling:** In `file.function.php`, the changes in the `get_path_ext` function appear to fix a vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate file extensions with special characters to bypass security checks or file type restrictions. There is a change that checks for non-ASCII characters in the extension, and a stricter check to allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores
3. **Insecure file hashing:** In `helper.function.php`, the `hash_path` function previously used a simpler hash that might have been predictable and potentially lead to hash collisions. It now includes file modification time in the hashing process, and switches to using the file's md5 hash, if the file is smaller than 50MB.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized file access:** By exploiting the insecure API key usage, an attacker could bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to files.
- **Bypassing file type checks:** Manipulating file extensions could potentially allow an attacker to upload or execute malicious files, bypassing restrictions on file type.
- **Predictable file paths**: Predictable file path hashes could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data by guessing the hashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** By sending crafted requests to the API endpoints.
- **File Uploads:** By manipulating file extensions during file upload processes or by modifying the filename before accessing the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's API endpoints and must have some knowledge of the application's internal file structure, or have control over file names.
- The attacker would require network access to the target system and have knowledge of the API endpoints and parameters used for file access.

**Additional notes:**
- The commit also includes various minor code style changes and updates to CSS files. These changes do not appear to be directly related to the security fix but are part of the general release.
- The provided diff does not give the details of the exact exploit or vulnerability being fixed but gives a good indication of the vulnerability locations.
