The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6141.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Essential Real Estate" prior to version 4.4.0 does not implement proper capability checks on its AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient capability checks on AJAX actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with a subscriber-level account can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database. When a user visits a page where the injected code is displayed, the malicious script will execute in their browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions within the user's session, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific actions (`gsf_change_font` and `gsf_save_active_font`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a subscriber-level account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send POST requests using the browser's console.
