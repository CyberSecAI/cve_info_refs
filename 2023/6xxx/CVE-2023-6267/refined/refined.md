  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-6267",
      "root_cause": "The JSON payload of a REST resource is processed (deserialized) before security constraints are evaluated when annotation-based security is used.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
         "Insecure deserialization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass security checks by crafting a malicious JSON payload that is processed before the security constraints are enforced. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of resources.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload to a vulnerable REST endpoint.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service."
