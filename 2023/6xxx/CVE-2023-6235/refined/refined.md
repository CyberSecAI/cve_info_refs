Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path element. Specifically, Duet Display version 2.5.9.1 improperly searches for and loads the `libusk.dll` file.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is CWE-427, which is an uncontrolled search path. The application does not validate the location from which it loads DLL files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution and persistence on the victim's system. By placing a malicious `libusk.dll` file in a specific directory, the attacker can force the application to load and execute it.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have write access to the `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\` directory to place the malicious DLL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\` directory on the target system, and must trick the user into executing the affected software. The vulnerability requires user interaction.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in Duet Display 2.5.9.1 allows a local attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting an uncontrolled search path. By placing a malicious `libusk.dll` file in a specific, writable location, the attacker can gain control of the system through the loading of the malicious DLL.
