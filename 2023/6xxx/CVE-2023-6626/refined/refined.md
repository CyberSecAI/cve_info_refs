- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings, which allows for stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input within plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who access the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Form Customizer**: By injecting malicious JavaScript into form fields within the Form Customizer settings.
    - **Translate**: By injecting malicious JavaScript into translation fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges, such as an administrator account, to access and modify the plugin settings pages. The unfiltered_html capability does not need to be enabled as the vulnerability bypasses it.
