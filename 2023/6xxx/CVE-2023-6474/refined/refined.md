- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection on the `manage-phlebotomist.php` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete phlebotomist records by tricking an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request, leading to unauthorized data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by an authenticated user, triggers the deletion of a phlebotomist record. This malicious form can be hosted on an attacker-controlled website or delivered via other means (e.g. email).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious website or open a crafted HTML page while the user has an active session with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials but needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameters to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
