Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the `getImage` parameter of the Chameleon Power framework. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path provided to the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22/CWE-35):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the `getImage` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify file paths outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning an attacker doesn't need local access to the server.
- **`getImage` Parameter:** The specific attack vector is through manipulation of the `getImage` parameter in the Chameleon Power framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable Chameleon Power framework.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate to the application (as indicated by "PR:N" in the CVSS vector).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Chameleon Power framework, version 1.0.
- There is no reported solution at the time of this advisory.
- The assigned CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.5, indicating a high severity.
- The CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Mart√≠nez Adan (adon90), a member of Holcim EDC.
