- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `tab` parameter before outputting it in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, which would be executed in the browser of a user who visits the crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious activities, including stealing user cookies, redirecting to malicious websites or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload within the `tab` parameter and tricks a logged-in administrator to open the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking on a malicious URL. The attacker does not need any special privileges, only the ability to craft a URL and convince a user to visit it.
