- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin discloses the content of password-protected posts to unauthenticated users due to a flaw in how it handles requests with the `?view=single-event` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass, disclosure of sensitive information (content of password-protected posts).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can view the content of password-protected posts by appending `?view=single-event` to the post URL, which could lead to unauthorized access to private information.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to a password-protected post URL by appending "?view=single-event".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication and can be an external, unprivileged user. The attacker needs to know the URL of a password protected post on the target website.
