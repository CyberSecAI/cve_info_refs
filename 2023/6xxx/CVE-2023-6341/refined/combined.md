# Disorder in the Court

## Description

Insufficient permission check vulnerabilities in public court record platforms from multiple vendors allowed unauthorized public access to sealed, confidential, unredacted, and/or otherwise restricted case documents. Affected documents include witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, child custody agreements, detailed allegations of abuse, corporate trade secrets, jury forms, and much more.

## Details

* **[Catalis - CMS360](#catalis---cms360)** is used in Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee. Catalis is a "government solutions" company that provides a wide array[1](#user-content-fn-1-e49319842bfc0d44f37b87fc1a28f5cb) of public record, payment, and regulatory/compliance platforms.

While all of the platforms allowed unintended public access to restricted documents, the severity varied based on the levels of restrictions that could be bypassed and the discoverability of document IDs. The methods used to exploit each of the vulnerabilities also varied, but could all be performed by an unauthenticated attacker using only a browser's developer tools.

## Platforms

### [Catalis](https://catalisgov.com/) - CMS360

To view documents, URLs with numeric document and case IDs were used. This allowed an unskilled attacker to stumble upon restricted documents by simply incrementing the document ID in the document URL.

Many courts configured CMS360 to disallow document viewing altogether, making it very difficult to guess document IDs, so it is unclear whether documents could be viewed if document IDs were discovered. Many courts also require a login to view cases, so it is not known whether those courts allowed viewing images.

* [CVE-2023-6341](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6341): Catalis (previously Icon Software) CMS 360 allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to view sensitive court documents by modifying document and other identifiers in URLs. The impact varies based on the intention and configuration of a specific CMS360 installation.

# Security flaws in court record systems used in five US states exposed sensitive legal documents

## The vulnerabilities allowed public access to restricted, sealed and confidential court filings using only a web browser

[Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/)

9:05 AM PST · November 30, 2023

Witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse and corporate trade secrets. These are some of the sensitive legal court filings that security researcher Jason Parker said they found exposed to the open internet for anyone to access, and from none other than the judiciaries themselves.

At the heart of any judiciary is its court records system, the technology stack for submitting and storing legal filings for criminal trials and civil legal cases. Court records systems are often in part online, allowing anyone to search and obtain public documents, while restricting access to sensitive legal filings in which public exposure could compromise a case.

But Parker said some court records systems used across the U.S. have simple security flaws that expose sealed, confidential and sensitive but unredacted legal filings to anyone on the web.

Parker told TechCrunch that they were contacted in September by someone who read their earlier report [documenting a vulnerability in Bluesky](https://github.com/qwell/bsky-exploits), the [new social network that emerged after Twitter’s sale](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/x-rival-bluesky-hits-2m-users-saying-federation-coming-early-next-year/) to Elon Musk. The tipster told Parker that two U.S. court records systems had vulnerabilities that were exposing sensitive legal filings to anyone on the web. The tipster reported the bugs to the affected courts but said they heard nothing back, Parker told TechCrunch in a call earlier this month.

Equipped with the tipster’s findings, Parker fell down a rabbit hole investigating several affected court records systems. Parker subsequently uncovered security flaws in at least eight court records systems used across Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee.

“The first document I ran across was an order from a judge in a domestic violence case. The order was to grant name changes for children to basically keep them safe from the spouse,” Parker told TechCrunch, speaking about reproducing the first vulnerability. “Immediately my jaw just went to the center of the earth and stayed that way for weeks.”

“The next document that I found in the other court was a full mental health evaluation. It was thirty-pages long in a criminal case, and it was as detailed as you would expect; it was from a doctor,” they added.

The bugs vary by complexity, but could all be exploited by anyone using only the developer tools built-in to any web browser, Parker said.

These kinds of so-called “client-side” bugs are exploitable with a browser because an affected system was not performing the proper security checks to determine who is allowed to access sensitive documents stored within.

One of the bugs was as easy to exploit as incrementing a document number in the browser’s address bar of one Florida court records system, said Parker. Another bug allowed anyone “automatic passwordless” access to a court records system by adding a six-letter code to any username, which Parker said they found as a clickable link in a Google search result.

With help from [vulnerability disclosure center CERT/CC](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) and [CISA’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure team](https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process), which assisted in the coordination of disclosing these flaws, Parker shared details of [nine total vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/11/30/multiple-vulnerabilities-affecting-web-based-court-case-and-document-management-systems) with the affected vendors and judiciaries in an effort to get them fixed.

What came back was a mixed bag of results.

Three technology vendors fixed the bugs in their respective court record systems, Parker said, but only two firms confirmed to TechCrunch that the fixes took effect.

Catalis, a government technology software company that makes CMS360, a court records system used by judiciaries across Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee, acknowledged the vulnerability in a “separate secondary application” used by some court systems that allows the public, attorneys or judges to search CMS360 data.

“We have no records or logs indicating that confidential data was accessed through that vulnerability, and have received no such reports or evidence,” said Catalis executive Eric Johnson in an email to TechCrunch. Catalis would not explicitly say if it maintains the specific logs it would need to rule out improper access to sensitive court documents.

Software company Tyler Technologies said it fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management Plus module in a court records system used exclusively in Georgia, the company told TechCrunch.

“We have been in communication with the security researcher and have confirmed the vulnerabilities,” said Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields. “At this time, we have no evidence of discovery or exploitation by a bad actor.” The company did not say how it came to this conclusion.

Parker said that Henschen & Associates, a local Ohio software maker that provides a court records system called CaseLook across the state, fixed the vulnerability but did not respond to emails. Henschen president Bud Henschen also did not respond to emails from TechCrunch, or confirm that the company had fixed the bug.

In [their disclosure published Thursday](https://github.com/qwell/disorder-in-the-court/), Parker also said they notified five counties in Florida by way of the state courts administrator’s office. The five Florida courts are thought to have developed their own court records systems in-house.

Only one county is known to have fixed the vulnerability found in their system and ruled out improper access to sensitive court records.

Sarasota County said it had fixed a vulnerability in its court records system it calls ClerkNet, which allowed access to documents by incrementing through numerically sequential document numbers. In a letter [provided to TechCrunch](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24178313-sarasota-county-letter-regarding-security-vulnerability) when reached for comment, Sarasota County clerk of the circuit court Karen Rushing said the review of its access logs “revealed no occurrences where sealed or confidential information was accessed.” The county disputed the existence of a second flaw reported by Parker.

Given the simplicity of some of the vulnerabilities, it is unlikely that Parker or the original tipster are the only people with knowledge of their exploitability.

The four remaining Florida counties have yet to acknowledge the flaws, say if they have implemented fixes, or confirm if they have the ability to determine if sensitive records were ever accessed.

Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, would not say if its systems were patched following Parker’s disclosure. In a statement, Hillsborough County Clerk spokesperson Carson Chambers said: “The confidentiality of public records is a top priority of the Hillsborough County Clerk’s office. Multiple security measures are in place to ensure confidential court records can only be viewed by authorized users. We consistently implement the latest security enhancements to Clerk systems to prohibit it from happening.”

Lee County, which covers Fort Myers and Cape Coral, also would not say if it had fixed the vulnerability, but said it reserved the right to take legal action against the security researcher.

When reached for comment, Lee County spokesperson Joseph Abreu provided an identical boilerplate statement as Hillsborough County, with the addition of a thinly veiled legal threat. “We interpret any unauthorized access, intentional or unintentional, as a potential violation of Florida Statute Chapter 815, and may also result in civil litigation by our office.”

Representatives for Monroe County and Brevard County, which Parker also filed vulnerability disclosures with, did not respond to requests for comment.

For Parker, their research amounts to hundreds of unpaid hours, but represents only the tip of the iceberg of affected court record systems, noting that at least two other court record systems have similar unpatched vulnerabilities today.

Parker said they hope their findings help make changes and spur on improvements to the security of government tech applications. “Gov-tech is broken,” they said.

Alert
# Multiple Vulnerabilities Affecting Web-Based Court Case and Document Management Systems

Release DateNovember 30, 2023

CISA has assisted a researcher with coordinating the disclosure of multiple researcher-discovered vulnerabilities affecting web-based case and document management systems used by multiple state, county, and municipal courts. Affected systems include products from Tyler Technologies and Catalis and custom software used by specific counties in Florida. In summary, the vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive documents by manipulating identifiers and file names in URLs. CISA understands that some of the vulnerabilities may have been mitigated. Further information is available in the [researcher’s disclosure](https://github.com/qwell/disorder-in-the-court/) and a [corresponding article](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/30/us-court-records-systems-vulnerabilities-exposed-sealed-documents/).

CISA encourages users and administrators to apply security updates as they become available for the following vulnerabilities:
