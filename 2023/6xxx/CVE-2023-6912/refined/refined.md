Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of protection against brute-force attacks within the M-Files Server's authentication mechanism. This allows an attacker to make unlimited login attempts without any restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307):** The M-Files Server does not implement any mechanisms to limit or block repeated login attempts, leaving it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Vulnerable API Methods:** Specific API methods within the M-Files Server are susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised User Accounts:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to the compromise of user accounts by guessing their passwords.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once an account is compromised, attackers gain unauthorized access to the system and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Attackers:**  Attackers do not need any prior authentication to launch a brute-force attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the M-Files Server.
*   **No User Privileges:**  The attacker does not need any user privileges or prior knowledge of the system, except for a valid username.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in M-Files Server versions prior to 23.12.13205.0. It also affects versions before 23.2 LTS SR6 and 23.8 LTS SR4.
*   Specific API methods within the M-Files Server are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   CVSS 3.1 Base Score: 7.5, Temporal Score: 6.7, Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
*   CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts.
*   CAPEC-49: Password Brute Forcing.
*   The vulnerability was internally found and has not been publicly exploited.
