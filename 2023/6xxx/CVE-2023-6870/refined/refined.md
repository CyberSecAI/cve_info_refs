Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-6870:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox on Android handles fullscreen notifications. Specifically, the use of Android Toast notifications for these notifications is problematic. A separate application running in the background, can also create Toast notifications. If a background application creates and displays a toast message, at the same time Firefox is trying to display a fullscreen notification, the background app's toast can suppress Firefox's notification. This is due to the way Android handles and prioritizes Toast notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Toast Notification Interference:** The primary weakness is that a background app can suppress fullscreen notifications in Firefox and Firefox Focus due to Toast message priority.
*   **Suppressed Fullscreen Notification:** The fullscreen notification, which is intended to inform the user when a website requests fullscreen access, can be suppressed, causing the user to be unaware they are in full screen mode.
* **Race Condition**: The timing of the fullscreen notification and the interfering background toast can cause the notification to be suppressed

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker could potentially create a malicious app that displays toast notifications to suppress the browser's fullscreen notification. This could potentially allow a malicious site to trick a user into believing they are still on the normal browser UI when they are in full screen and possibly on a malicious site.
*   **UX Degradation**: A non-malicious app might accidentally interfere with the Firefox notification and the user would not be alerted of the fullscreen change.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Android App:** The attack requires a malicious Android app installed on the user's device.
*   **Background Toast:** The malicious app would need to run a thread in the background that displays Android Toast notifications at the same time the browser attempts to display the fullscreen notification.
*   **Website Interaction:** The user would also need to interact with a malicious or compromised website within Firefox that requests full screen mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Android App Installation:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious Android app.
*   **Website Control:** The attacker also needs a way to control or compromise a website to initiate the fullscreen request.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to ensure that the Toast notifications are displayed at the correct time to suppress the browser's notification.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability affects Firefox and Firefox Focus on Android.
*   The bug report indicates that this was a regression from a previous fix related to fullscreen notifications.
*   The fix involved moving away from using Android Toasts to using a custom dialog to display the fullscreen notification.
*   The security severity of this vulnerability was initially considered moderate but was later downgraded to low due to the requirement of a separate malicious app.
