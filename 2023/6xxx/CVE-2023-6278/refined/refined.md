The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6278.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Biteship for WooCommerce plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `biteship_error` and `biteship_message` parameters before outputting them on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities. High privilege users like admin are most at risk.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `biteship_error` or `biteship_message` parameter. The victim, typically a logged-in administrator, needs to be tricked into visiting this malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL and trick a user, particularly an administrator, into visiting the URL.
