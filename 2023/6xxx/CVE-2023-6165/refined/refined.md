- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "The name of the user_login field in registration form" setting is vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A high privilege user, such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When other users access the affected page, the malicious script will execute in their browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings via the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have admin or other high-privilege access to the WordPress instance.
