## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Restrict Usernames Emails Characters Plugin < 3.1.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Access the "Restrict Usernames Emails Characters" settings
2. For the field "The name of the user\_login field in registration form", enter the payload `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>`
3. Click "Save Changes" and see the XSS.
