Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Quarkus Cache Runtime handles context when using `@CacheResult` on a `Uni` (a reactive type in Quarkus). Specifically, when a cached `Uni` is reused, it might reuse the "completion" context from the initial request that populated the cache, instead of using the context of the current request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Context Propagation:** The core issue is the improper reuse of the initial request's context by the cached Uni. This leads to a context switch, where the processing of the current request happens within the context of a previous request.
*   **Potential for Sensitive Data Exposure:**  If the cached Uni's context contains sensitive information (e.g., user-specific data or authorization tokens), this could be leaked to subsequent users when a cached response is returned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** A malicious user could potentially receive a response meant for another user, thus accessing sensitive data associated with that user's context. This is particularly concerning for POST requests, where user-specific data is often submitted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting cached responses associated with a `Uni` that is decorated with the `@CacheResult` annotation. By sending a POST request, an attacker could potentially obtain a cached response intended for another user if the cache reuses the context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to an application that uses Quarkus and utilizes caching with `@CacheResult` on reactive types such as `Uni`.
*   The attacker must be able to trigger a scenario where a cached response is returned which contains the context of another user.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in versions of Quarkus prior to 2.13.9.CR2 and 3.2.9.GA.
* The issue is addressed in Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.13.9 via RHSA-2023:7700.
* The fix involves handling duplicated contexts in the `CacheResultInterceptor`, as noted by the QUARKUS-3781 entry in the Red Hat Security Advisory.
