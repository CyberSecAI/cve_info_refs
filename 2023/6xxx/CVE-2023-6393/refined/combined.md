| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2253113#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2023-12-06 05:20:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found under Quarkus Cache Runtime. When a request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult, and if the cached Uni reuses the initial "completion" context, the processing switches to the context of the cached Uni instead of the request context. It can be a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information. A malicious user could benefit from this as a POST request could possibly return the response that is meant for another user, having access to sensitive data.  <https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/37078>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2253113#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-07 14:26:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.13.9  Via RHSA-2023:7700 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7700](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7700)   ``` |  |
