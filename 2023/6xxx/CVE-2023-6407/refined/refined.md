- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software. This allows a low-privileged local attacker to cause arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary file deletion with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with low privileges can trigger the vulnerability. This is done during a service restart.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and low privileges.
