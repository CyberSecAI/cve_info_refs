The Contact Form 7 – Dynamic Text Extension plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.0 via the CF7_get_custom_field and CF7_get_current_user shortcodes due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access or higher to access arbitrary metadata of any post type, referencing the post by id and the meta by key.
