Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation on user-controlled keys within the `CF7_get_custom_field` and `CF7_get_current_user` shortcodes of the Contact Form 7 â€“ Dynamic Text Extension plugin. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary meta keys and user data keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses user-supplied input (`key` attribute in the shortcode) to access post meta and user data without proper authorization checks.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The plugin doesn't validate or sanitize the `key` parameter, allowing attackers to read data they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Private Personal Information:** An attacker can access sensitive post metadata and user data, potentially exposing private information.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** Attackers can bypass intended access controls and retrieve information without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can craft malicious shortcodes with arbitrary `key` attributes within a Contact Form 7 form.
*   **Direct Access via crafted shortcode:** By crafting shortcodes that include the `CF7_get_custom_field` or `CF7_get_current_user` shortcodes with a `key` parameter to target a specific meta field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least contributor-level access to create or edit forms.
*   **Knowledge of Meta Keys/User Data:** The attacker needs to know or guess the meta keys or user data keys to target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.1.0.
*   The plugin's version 4.2.0 includes a fix for this vulnerability by introducing allow lists for meta keys and user data keys.
*   The plugin now includes a settings page where administrators can manage which keys are allowed to be accessed via the shortcodes.
*   A form scanner was introduced to detect usage of disallowed keys.
*   The fix includes a validation check in the CF7 Form Validator to prevent use of disallowed keys.
