- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not implement proper capability and nonce checks on its AJAX action callback functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization checks on AJAX endpoints allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with subscriber-level privileges or higher can create, delete, or modify menus on the affected WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting and sending AJAX requests to vulnerable endpoints (`delete_menu` and `add_menu`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site. They can then use browser's console to send malicious AJAX requests.
