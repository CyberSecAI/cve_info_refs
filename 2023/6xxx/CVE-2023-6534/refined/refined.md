    "RELATED": "TRUE",
    "DETAILS": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bug in the implementation of sequence number validation within the pf(4) packet filter, which is part of FreeBSD, leads to incorrect validation of TCP sequence numbers.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of TCP sequence numbers.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject packets into a TCP stream destined for a host behind a pf firewall. This can be used for denial-of-service attacks (e.g., sending TCP RST packets) or potentially other attacks.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker who can impersonate the remote host and guess the connection's port numbers can inject packets into a TCP stream.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to impersonate the remote host and be able to guess the connection's port numbers."

    "RELATED": "TRUE",
    "DETAILS": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the sequence number validation process within the pf(4) firewall, which is a component of FreeBSD.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The pf(4) firewall does not properly validate TCP sequence numbers.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject packets into a TCP stream directed towards a host protected by the pf firewall. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) attack.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker impersonates the remote host and guesses the connection's port numbers to inject packets.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to impersonate the remote host and have knowledge of the connection's port numbers."

            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The pf(4) firewall does not validate sequence numbers correctly when tracking stateful TCP connections.",
