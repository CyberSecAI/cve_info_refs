# Release iText Core 8.0.2

#### Release date: Oct 25, 2023

Just in time for Halloween, hereâs a new release of your favorite open-source PDF library for Java and .NET. Thereâs nothing spooky about: [iText Core](https://itextpdf.com/products/itext-core) version 8.0.2 and the updated [iText Suite](https://itextpdf.com/products/itext-suite) add-ons in this release though! Letâs take a closer look.

## PDF/A-4 support

The **a** ("Accessibility"), **u** ("Unicode") and **b** ("Basic") conformance levels in earlier variants of PDF/A have been replaced by two new profiles: **e** and **f**. The PDF/UA format now exists for Universal Accessibility, and Unicode is now a requirement in PDF/A-4 for text encoding rather than a specific conformance level. Therefore, the base PDF/A-4 specification replaces the **b** and **u** conformance levels.

PDF/A-4e (Engineering) replaces the old PDF/E standard for technical documents, and supports Rich Media and 3D annotations, PDF/A-4f allows any type of file to be embedded, similar to PDF/A-3, and builds upon PDFs existing container format capabilities.

In addition, PDF/A-4 has better support for the archiving of fillable forms than PDF/A-3, since non-static content is now allowed in the form of JavaScript. Therefore, information about interactive forms can be both stored and archived.

## Digital signing

We continue the digital signature revolution we introduced with iText Core version 8.0 with a significant improvement which allows signing to be performed in several steps, rather than as a single operation. This can be especially useful to facilitate concurrency and manage resources efficiently in batch operations. The new deferred signing API already allowed this to some degree, although it required users to manually implement `IExternalSignatureContainer` themselves â which is no longer necessary.

Thereâs also a nice improvement for the appearance of digital signatures. Now, the generation of the appearance of signature form fields is delegated to the layout module rather than being manually implemented in the `PdfSignatureAppearance` class, enabling completely customizable appearances. This means the old layer-based approach is outdated, and has been deprecated.

Stay tuned for future releases to see further strides in digital signing.

## Annotation flattening

There are some nice changes to annotation flattening, where weâve implemented a high-level API to simplify and enable easy customization of annotation flattening. You can either tell iText to flatten *all* annotations with just two lines of code, or if you prefer you can define *specific types* of annotation to be flattened. The power is now at your fingertips.

## Bug fixes and miscellaneous

Thereâs also some miscellaneous improvements and fixes for the layout module relating to table row and cell properties, as well as fixes for a potential infinite loop with tables. Weâve also fixed an issue where a maliciously crafted PDF with a huge number of pages and empty data structures could cause an out of memory error. Now iText will avoid such issues by more intelligently allocating memory for documents like this.

Since this release, this issue has been published as [CVE-2023-6299](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6299). However, the CVE report is, at the time of writing (28 November 2023) incorrect, since this vulnerability was fixed in this release. For more information, refer to our [CVE information](https://kb.itextpdf.com/home/it7kb/cves) page.

The `itext.bouncy-castle-adapter` previously relied upon the `Portable.BouncyCastle` dependency. However, as of this release, we transitioned to use the newer `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` package officially maintained by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle Inc.

As always, you can click the Changelog tab in the table below to see the full rundown on whatâs new in Core, and details of other bugfixes for this release.

### 2022

* [CVE-2022-24198](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24198) - disputed (check the link for details, or see the page linked above)
* [CVE-2022-24196](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24196) - addressed with 7.1.18 and 7.2.2
* [CVE-2022-24197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24197) - addressed with 7.1.18 and 7.2.2

### 2021

* [CVE-2021-43113](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43113) - addressed with 7.1.17 and 5.5.13.3

---

## iText dependencies:

### 2024

* [CVE-2024-47554](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47554) - This is a potential CVE (under analysis as of this writing) that affects one of our dependencies, Apache Commons IO. Versions >= 2.0 < 2.14.0. This is fixed with pdfOCR 4.0.0.

* [CVE-2024-34447](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34447)/[CVE-2024-30172](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30172)/[CVE-2024-30171](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30171)/[CVE-2024-29857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29857) - These are CVEs that affect one of our dependencies, BouncyCastle < 1.78. Versions 8.0.4 and above, and version 7.2.7 and above, are not affected by this. In case you are using version 7.2.6, you can add the bouncy castle dependency 1.78 to your project, which will be used instead. There is also the case where our licensing libraries are affected (4.0.6), and the fix is the same.

Hereâs a simple example of how to do it, if youâre using Maven (where the version needs to be at least 1.78 (1.78.1 was already available at the time of this writing)):

XML
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk18on</artifactId>
  <version>${bouncycastle.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcprov-jdk18on</artifactId>
  <version>${bouncycastle.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

* [CVE-2024-21634](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21634) - This CVE report describes a potential denial-of-service issue existing in `ion-java`, which is a transitive dependency for our `licensing-remote` module since `aws-java-sdk-cognitoidentity` depends upon `ion-java`. However, we do not consider this to be critical, since the report states âDo not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trustâ as a workaround. As `licensing-remote` only works with our AWS infrastructure, it is a trusted source. So, we are not affected. In any case, starting from version 4.1.4 of `licensing-remote`weâve updated `aws-java-sdk-kinesis` to version 1.12.658 which addresses this issue.

### 2022

* [CVE-2022-45688](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45688) - can be reported by `OWASP Dependency Checker`  for `jackson-core-2.13.4.jar`  however, we don't have a dependency on the vulnerable library ([details](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5502))
* [CVE-2022-45146](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45146) - FIPS-compliant users are unaffected because the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11 (and this module is only used for FIPS compliance)
