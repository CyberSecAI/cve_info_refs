The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA, versions <=v11.10 and =v2017.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$PROJ_ID_STR`) into a SQL query in the `general/wiki/cp/manage/delete.php` route, without proper sanitization or parameterization. The injected parameter is `$TERM_ID_STR`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input. Specifically, the code directly incorporates a variable into the SQL query string, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, table data) through blind SQL injection techniques. An attacker can also potentially modify data or even gain control over the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `general/wiki/cp/manage/delete.php` route. The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `$TERM_ID_STR` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `delete.php` endpoint and manipulate the `$TERM_ID_STR` parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated since the vulnerable code is in the `delete.php` file.

The content provides details about the vulnerable code, explains how to exploit it using blind SQL injection (including specific examples using `substr` and `DATABASE()` functions to extract database name), and provides Proof of Concept (POC) payloads, which are more detailed than the CVE description.
