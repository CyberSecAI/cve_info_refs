### Description

A credential disclosure vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an authenticated read-only administrator to obtain the plaintext credentials of stored external system integrations such as LDAP, SCP, RADIUS, TACACS+, and SNMP from the web interface.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cloud NGFW | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.1 | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.0 | < 11.0.1 | >= 11.0.1 |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | < 10.2.4 | >= 10.2.4 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | < 10.1.9 | >= 10.1.9 |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.12 | >= 10.0.12 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.16 | >= 9.1.16 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.17 | >= 9.0.17 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.24-h1 | >= 8.1.24-h1 |
| Prisma Access | None | All |

### Severity: MEDIUM, Suggested Urgency: REDUCED

CVSS-B:
6.1 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/R:U/V:D/RE:L/U:Green](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/R:U/V:D/RE:L/U:Green))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-701: Weakness Introduced During Design](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/701 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/701")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.24-h1, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions.

You should issue new credentials for the impacted external integrations after you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version to prevent the misuse of previously exposed credentials.

Please note that customers impacted by the PAN-OS root and default certificate expiration issue must carefully select the fixed version of PAN-OS they upgrade their devices to when addressing this vulnerability to not reintroduce the certificate issue. More information and support for the certificate expiration issue in PAN-OS is available at <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/customer-advisories/emergency-update-required-pan-os-root-and-default-certificate/ta-p/564672>.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue requires the attacker to have authenticated access to the PAN-OS web interface. You can mitigate the impact of this issue by following the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation at <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices>.
