- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A design flaw in PAN-OS allows a read-only administrator to access plaintext credentials of external system integrations through the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext storage of sensitive credentials for external system integrations (LDAP, SCP, RADIUS, TACACS+, SNMP) and insufficient access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with read-only administrative access can obtain plaintext credentials for external system integrations. These credentials could potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to the external systems or other resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based; Attacker needs to be able to access the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid read-only administrator credentials to the PAN-OS web interface.
