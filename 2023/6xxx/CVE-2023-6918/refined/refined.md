{
  "CVE-2023-6918": {
    "description": "The libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause in low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes or at worst usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating connection.",
    "root_cause": "Missing checks for return values from message digest operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Crashes, NULL pointer dereferences, usage of uninitialized memory in key derivation, leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to cause a low-memory situation in order to trigger the vulnerability and obtain a non-matching key which will terminate the connection. This also might trigger a denial of service.",
