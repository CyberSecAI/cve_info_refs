Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-6186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- LibreOffice supports hyperlinks that can target not only typical web protocols (http/https) but also internal commands or built-in macros.
- In affected versions, these internal command/macro-launching hyperlinks could be executed without prior warning or explicit user permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Macro Permission Validation:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of macro execution permissions before executing internal command/macro hyperlinks.
- **Unrestricted Hyperlink Targets:** The ability to use internal commands or macros via hyperlinks without user consent creates an attack vector.
- **Floating Frames:** The possibility to use these malicious hyperlinks in floating frames exacerbated the problem

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious document with a hyperlink that, when activated by the user, would execute arbitrary scripts or internal commands within the LibreOffice environment. This can be leveraged to run malicious code.
-  In the worst case, this could lead to a full compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Document:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted document containing a specially crafted hyperlink.
- **User Interaction:** The user must click or activate the malicious hyperlink within the document to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Document Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a document that LibreOffice can open.
- **Hyperlink Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to insert a specific hyperlink structure in the document.
- **User Enticement:** The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious document and activate the malicious link.
