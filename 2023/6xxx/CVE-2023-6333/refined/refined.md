Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The affected ControlByWeb Relay products allow an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's session. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and has low attack complexity. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- The scripts are stored on the device and executed when a user interacts with the vulnerable part of the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (have valid credentials) to access the vulnerable web interface of the affected ControlByWeb Relay products.
- The attacker can be located remotely.

**Affected Products and Firmware:**
- X-332-24I: Firmware 1.06
- X-301-I: Firmware 1.15
- X-301-24I: Firmware 1.15

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5
- CVSS vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L

**Mitigation:**
- Update to the following versions:
  - X301 V1.20
  - X332 V1.09
- Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
- Locate control system networks behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
- Use secure methods for remote access, such as VPNs (updated to the most current version available).
- Implement cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.
- Organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.
