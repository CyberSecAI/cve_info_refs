The MainWP Dashboard  – WordPress Manager for Multiple Websites Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSS Injection via the ‘newColor’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary CSS values into the site tags.
