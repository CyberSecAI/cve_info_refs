  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a Bleichenbacher-like side-channel attack on PKCS#1 1.5 decryption within the pkcs11-provider.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability in PKCS#1 1.5 decryption implementation",
      "Timing differences in the processing of padding or invalid ciphertext may reveal information about the secret key."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the plaintext or parts of the secret key used for decryption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network attacks are possible.",
      "Attacker sends specially crafted ciphertext to the vulnerable PKCS#1 1.5 decryption interface."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send data for decryption by the vulnerable component.",
      "Attacker needs to be able to observe the time taken for decryption operations."
