{
  "CVE-2023-6291": {
    "Description": "The redirect_uri validation logic in Keycloak allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts.",
    "Root cause": "The validation logic is performed on a URL decoded version of the redirect_uri, which no longer represents the original input. This causes a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient redirect_uri validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may be able to bypass redirect_uri validation, and steal authorization codes or tokens, potentially impersonating other users.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious redirect_uri that bypasses the validation logic.",
     "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the redirect_uri parameter in an OAuth 2.0 or OIDC authentication flow.",
    "Affected Products": [
      "Red Hat Single Sign-On",
      "Red Hat build of Keycloak"
    ],
   "More Info": "The vulnerability occurs in the verifyRedirectUri method where Keycloak receives a URL like '<https://www%2ekeycloak%2eorg%2fapp%2f:y@example.com>' which is interpreted by Keycloak as 'keycloak.org' while the browser treats the authority as 'example.com'."
