Issued:
2024-02-13
Updated:
2024-02-13
# RHSA-2024:0801 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Images](#containers)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.7 for OpenShift image enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

A new image is available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.7, running on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 and 3.11, and 4.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is an integrated sign-on solution, available as a
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift containerized image. The Red Hat
Single Sign-On for OpenShift image provides an authentication server that
you can use to log in centrally, log out, and register. You can also manage
user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web
services.

Security Fix(es):

* redirect\_uri validation logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts (CVE-2023-6291)
* guava: insecure temporary directory creation (CVE-2023-2976)
* jetty-server: OutOfMemoryError for large multipart without filename read via request.getParameter() (CVE-2023-26048)
* jetty-server: Cookie parsing of quoted values can exfiltrate values from other cookies (CVE-2023-26049)
* reflected XSS via wildcard in OIDC redirect\_uri (CVE-2023-6134)
* open redirect via "form\_post.jwt" JARM response mode (CVE-2023-6927)
* santuario: Private Key disclosure in debug-log output (CVE-2023-44483)
* Log Injection during WebAuthn authentication or registration (CVE-2023-6484)

This erratum releases a new image for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.7 for use within the OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, OpenShift Container Platform
3.11, and within the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for on-premise or private cloud deployments, aligning with the standalone product release.

## Solution

To update to the latest Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.7 for OpenShift
image, Follow these steps to pull in the content:

1. On your main hosts, ensure you are logged into the CLI as a
cluster administrator or user with project administrator access
to the global "openshift" project. For example:

$ oc login -u system:admin

2. Update the core set of Red Hat Single Sign-On resources for OpenShift
in the "openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ for resource in sso76-image-stream.json \
sso76-https.json \
sso76-mysql.json \
sso76-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-postgresql.json \
sso76-postgresql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-https.json \
sso76-x509-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.7.GA/templates/$](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.7.GA/templates/%24){resource}
done

3. Install the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.7 for OpenShift streams in the
"openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-sso76-openshift:1.0

# RHSA-2023:7857 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Images](#containers)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.6 for OpenShift image enhancement and security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

A new image is available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.6, running on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 and 3.11, and 4.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is an integrated sign-on solution, available as a Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift containerized image. The Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift image provides an authentication server that you can use to log in centrally, log out, and register. You can also manage user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web services.

This erratum releases a new image for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.6 for use within the OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, and OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for on-premise or private cloud deployments, aligning with the standalone product release.

Security Fix(es):

* keycloak: redirect\_uri validation logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts (CVE-2023-6134)
* keycloak: reflected XSS via wildcard in OIDC redirect\_uri (CVE-2023-6291)
* keycloak: offline session token DoS (CVE-2023-6563)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

To update to the latest Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.6 for OpenShift image, follow these steps to pull in the content:

1. On your main hosts, ensure you are logged into the CLI as a cluster administrator or user with project administrator access to the global "openshift" project. For example:

$ oc login -u system:admin

2. Update the core set of Red Hat Single Sign-On resources for OpenShift in the "openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ for resource in sso76-image-stream.json \
sso76-https.json \
sso76-mysql.json \
sso76-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-postgresql.json \
sso76-postgresql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-https.json \
sso76-x509-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.6.GA/templates/$](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.6.GA/templates/%24){resource}
done

3. Install the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.6 for OpenShift streams in the "openshift" project by running the following command:

$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-sso76-openshift:1.0

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2255027#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-18 15:53:08 UTC  ``` An attacker can steal authorization codes or tokens from clients using a wildcard in the JARM response mode "form_post.jwt". It is observed that changing the response_mode parameter in the original proof of concept from "form_post" to "form_post.jwt" can bypass the security patch implemented to address [CVE-2023-6134](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6134).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2255027#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-18 15:56:03 UTC  ``` Red Hat would like to thankPontus Hanssen <Pontus.Hanssen> for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2255027#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-18 16:22:46 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2255024](show_bug.cgi?id=2255024 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2023-6920 keycloak-core: Reflected XSS via wildcard in OIDC redirect_uri.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2023-11-24 19:06:10 UTC  ``` An issue was found in the redirect_uri validation logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts.   The problem arises in the verifyRedirectUri method, which attempts to enforce rules on user-controllable input, but essentially causes a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs. Keycloak, for example, receives "<https://www%2ekeycloak%2eorg%2fapp%2f:y@example.com>" and thinks the authority to be keycloak.org when it is actually example.com. This happens because the validation logic is performed on a URL decoded version, which no longer represents the original input.  Refer: <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/24819>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2023:7855 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7855](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7855)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:7856 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7856](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7856)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2023:7854 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7854](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7854)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:04:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Single Sign-On 7.6.6  Via RHSA-2023:7858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7858)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:16:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.7  Via RHSA-2023:7860 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7860](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7860)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:55:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2023:7857 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7857](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7857)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 20:04:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2023:7861 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7861](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7861)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-13 16:52:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:0799 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0799](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0799)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-13 16:53:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:0800 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0800](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0800)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-13 16:53:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:0798 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0798](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0798)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-13 16:54:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2024:0801 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0801](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0801)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2251407#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-13 17:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2024:0804 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0804](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0804)   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-12-06 18:47:17 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been discovered in the way RH-SSO handles offline tokens, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion. The issue is caused by the way how the server processes offline tokens.  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating just two offline tokens. Once these tokens are created, the attacker can interact with the endpoint by triggering a list of the multiple sessions of the user. In environments where there could be potentially millions of offline tokens created by all users, this action leads to an excessive consumption of server memory.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2023:7855 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7855](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7855)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:7856 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7856](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7856)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2023:7854 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7854](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7854)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:04:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Single Sign-On 7.6.6  Via RHSA-2023:7858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7858)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:55:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2023:7857 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7857](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7857)   ``` |  |
