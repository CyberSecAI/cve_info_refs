- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Arbitrary livestatus commands could be injected into the core via the WebUI due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Livestatus command injection vulnerability. Specifically, newline characters in parameters were not stripped, allowing attackers to inject malicious livestatus commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access or modify system behavior. The CVSS score indicates a high impact with potential for low confidentiality and integrity impact, but with high availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires a low level of privileges (PR:L), exploiting the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers require network access to the web interface and a valid user account with at least low privileges. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
