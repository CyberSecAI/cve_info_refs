- Phishing attacks: The vulnerability could be used to launch phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- QR Code: An attacker can craft a malicious QR code that, when scanned, leads to session hijacking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to create and deliver a malicious QR code to a targeted user.
