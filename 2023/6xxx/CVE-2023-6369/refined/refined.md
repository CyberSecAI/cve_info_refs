Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, specifically from `www.wordfence.com`, directly references CVE-2023-6369 and describes a missing authorization vulnerability in the "Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS" plugin.  The other files detail the vulnerable code. Thus, the content is directly relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The root cause of the vulnerability is a **missing capability check** in multiple AJAX actions within the Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS WordPress plugin. This means that the plugin does not properly verify if the user performing an action has the necessary permissions to do so.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to check user capabilities before executing several AJAX actions. This allows lower-privileged users (like subscribers) to access or modify data they should not have access to.
    - **Insecure AJAX Handling:** AJAX actions are not properly secured, which can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:**  Authenticated attackers can disclose sensitive information by accessing data they should not be able to.
    - **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform actions they are not authorized to, such as saving advanced plugin settings, cancelling export processes, deleting exported zip files or requesting the plugin to export pages and data. This could disrupt the plugin's functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the WordPress AJAX interface, specifically targeting vulnerable AJAX actions provided by the plugin.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site. Subscriber-level access is sufficient for exploitation in the vulnerable versions.
    - **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to make requests to the WordPress site through the network.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is present in the following AJAX actions (as referenced in the Wordfence article and source code):
    - `cancel_rc_html_export_process` (cancelRcExportProcess.php)
    - `delete_exported_zip_file` (deleteExportedZipFile.php)
    - `export_log_percentage` (exportLogPercentage.php)
    - `rc_export_wp_page_to_static_html` (requestForWpPageToStaticHtml.php)
    - `saveAdvancedSettings` (saveAdvancedSettings.php)
    - `rc_search_posts` (searchPosts.php)
    - `see_logs_in_details` (seeLogsInDetails.php)

The code snippets show how these functions are registered to WordPressâ€™s `wp_ajax_` hook, and that the functions themselves lack capability checks before executing the request.
The fix, implemented in commit `3002740`, includes adding a nonce check, and a check to ensure that the user calling the function has access.

In summary, CVE-2023-6369 highlights a significant authorization vulnerability in the Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS plugin, where a lack of proper capability checks on AJAX endpoints allows authenticated, lower-privileged users to gain unauthorized access and perform actions that should be restricted to administrators.
