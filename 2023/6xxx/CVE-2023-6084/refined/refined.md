- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly concatenates the `$VU_ID` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive database information, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data, by injecting malicious SQL queries. The attacker can use blind SQL injection to extract the information through timing attacks based on delays caused by specific queries.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `general/vehicle/checkup/delete.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `$VU_ID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a manipulated `$VU_ID` parameter. The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
