- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An OS command injection vulnerability exists within the XML API of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS. This occurs due to improper neutralization of argument delimiters in a command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-88) allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system through the XML API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated API user can disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with limited privileges on the firewall.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network access to the XML API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires authenticated access to the PAN-OS XML API with high privileges.
