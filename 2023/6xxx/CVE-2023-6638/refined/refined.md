### Summary:
This CVE relates to a missing authorization vulnerability in the "GTG Product Feed for Shopping" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `update_settings` function lacks proper capability checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `update_settings` function in the `Admin.php` file of the plugin does not perform authorization checks, which allows unauthenticated users to invoke this function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of capability checks in the `update_settings` function, which allows any user, including unauthenticated ones, to modify plugin settings via a POST request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can modify arbitrary plugin settings. While the specific impact of this is not detailed, changing settings can lead to:
  - Data corruption by altering how product feeds are generated.
    -  Changing the product feed can result in inaccurate information being sent to Google Shopping or other channels, which can lead to lost sales or poor rankings.
  - Injection of malicious code through the settings leading to further compromise.
  - Potential disruption of the plugin's functionality or other site functionality by making changes to the plugin's configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- An attacker can send a POST request to the `update_settings` function to alter plugin settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific capabilities or position is required.
- An attacker doesn't need to be logged in to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
