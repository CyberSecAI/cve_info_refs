- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect selection of fuse values in the Controller 7000 platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Incorrect fuse values allow an attacker to bypass protection mechanisms and enable local debug.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass protection mechanisms to enable local debug. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access is required (AV:P).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires physical access to the affected device (Controller 7000 or Controller 7000 Single Door Controller). No special privileges or user interaction are required (PR:N/UI:N).
