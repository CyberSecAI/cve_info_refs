Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6329

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `iDS-Core.dll` login routine of Control iD iDSecure. It utilizes a "passwordCustom" authentication method that relies on a predictable calculation based on a server-specific serial and a user-supplied random value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The "passwordCustom" mechanism, intended as a fallback, can be exploited to bypass normal authentication procedures.
*   **Predictable Credentials:** The `passwordCustom` value is derived from a predictable formula using the server's serial number (`ServerJWT.Serial`) and a user-provided random value (`passwordRandom`). The server serial can be retrieved without authentication.
*   **Hardcoded Default Admin Password:** After successful bypass using `passwordCustom`, the system either creates a new 'admin' operator or resets an existing one to have the default password "admin."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Administrative Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain administrative access to the iDSecure system.
*   **Data Breach & System Manipulation:** With admin access, the attacker can perform any administrative tasks, including data manipulation, potentially gaining access to sensitive information and disrupting operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to the affected server's API endpoints, specifically `/api/login/unlockGetData` and `/api/login/`.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing local access or prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system on port 30443.
*   **Knowledge of Target Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the API endpoint `/api/login/unlockGetData` to retrieve the server's serial number and `/api/login/` to perform authentication bypass.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor has not responded to Tenable's attempts to disclose the issue.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability and showing how an attacker can calculate a valid passwordCustom value.
