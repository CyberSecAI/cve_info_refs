Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and lack of prepared statements when handling the `group_id` parameter in the `WP SMS` plugin. Specifically, the `group_id` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `group_id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
*  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The SQL injection can be leveraged to achieve Reflected XSS. While not directly detailed, it is likely achieved by injecting malicious Javascript code into the database which is then reflected back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries.
*    **Cross-Site Scripting:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the user, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request where the `group_id` parameter can be manipulated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access or higher to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/admin/subscribers/class-wpsms-subscribers-table.php` file of the WP SMS plugin.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including version 6.5.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 6.5.1, by implementing prepared statements with placeholders to avoid SQL injection and by adding a nonce to the delete subscriber functionality.
