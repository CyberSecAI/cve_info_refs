Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and lack of access control for the `vg_display_data` shortcode in the "Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin allowed the use of the shortcode with the `object_id_type` set to `callable` which would allow the user to call any function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Code Injection:** The plugin was vulnerable to code injection because it allowed execution of arbitrary functions through the `vg_display_data` shortcode.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The plugin did not properly validate the `object_id` parameter when `object_id_type` was set to `callable` which allowed execution of arbitrary functions.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin did not restrict access to the vulnerable shortcode, allowing authenticated users with contributor-level permissions and above to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Full Site Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution could lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress site, including data theft, site defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the `vg_display_data` shortcode.
*   Attackers can inject malicious code through the `object_id` parameter when `object_id_type` is set to `callable`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor+ Role:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level privileges to be able to use the shortcode.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 1.2.1 and earlier of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.0.
*   The fix includes removing the `callable` option for `object_id_type` and introducing a whitelist of allowed keys for the shortcode to prevent arbitrary data access.
*   The `sanitization` parameter was removed and all output is now sanitized with `wp_kses_post`
*   The `wp_filter` parameter was removed, and replaced with `wpautop` and `do_shortcodes` parameters.
