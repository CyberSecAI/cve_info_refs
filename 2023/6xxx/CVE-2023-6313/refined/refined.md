- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The URL shortener system does not properly sanitize POST parameters, specifically the input URL link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user visits the home page of the website. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious payload through the input field for the URL link and when the application renders the page with this unsanitized data, the XSS payload executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the URL shortener input field and enter a malicious JavaScript payload.
