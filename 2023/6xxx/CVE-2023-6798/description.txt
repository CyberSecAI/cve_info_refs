The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy â€“ Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News & YouTube Video Feeds Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized settings update due to a missing capability check when updating settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access or above to change the plugin's settings including proxy settings, which are also exposed to authors.
