| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-12-06 18:47:17 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been discovered in the way RH-SSO handles offline tokens, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion. The issue is caused by the way how the server processes offline tokens.  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating just two offline tokens. Once these tokens are created, the attacker can interact with the endpoint by triggering a list of the multiple sessions of the user. In environments where there could be potentially millions of offline tokens created by all users, this action leads to an excessive consumption of server memory.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2023:7855 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7855](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7855)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:7856 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7856](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7856)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 18:58:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2023:7854 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7854](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7854)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:04:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Single Sign-On 7.6.6  Via RHSA-2023:7858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7858)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2253308#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-14 19:55:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2023:7857 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7857](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7857)   ``` |  |

## Description

![@chehrhar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43938163?v=4&size=48)[chehrhar](https://github.com/chehrhar)opened [on Jul 26, 2022](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/13340#issue-1318390700)
### Describe the bug

We have approx. 6 million offline sessions in the database and enabled lazy loading of offline sessions.

We ran into performance issues:

If a user has >= 2 user sessions and you open the consents tab in the admin UI for this user, the following code tries to load the corresponding offline client sessions:

[keycloak/model/jpa/src/main/java/org/keycloak/models/jpa/session/JpaUserSessionPersisterProvider.java](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/febb447919044943241ad97200821c7da5099cb3/model/jpa/src/main/java/org/keycloak/models/jpa/session/JpaUserSessionPersisterProvider.java#L383)

Line 383
in
[febb447](/keycloak/keycloak/commit/febb447919044943241ad97200821c7da5099cb3)

|  | TypedQuery<PersistentClientSessionEntity> queryClientSessions = em.createNamedQuery("findClientSessionsOrderedById", PersistentClientSessionEntity.class); |
| --- | --- |

The where clause:

sess.userSessionId >= :fromSessionId and sess.userSessionId <= :toSessionId

can cause the query to load lots of client sesssions.

In our test the user had 2 user sessions with the IDs 156db9e9-d2ad-4168-89ba-21818a475dcc' and 'd4fed476-52c3-44d6-a510-7db0158dc032'

The query tried to load about 3 million client sessions.

The long-running query leads to infinispan timeout exceptions and can even cause the kubernetes pods to get unhealthy.

The where clause had been changed from an IN-clause to the above BETWEEN-clause in this PR: <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/8012/files#diff-9e427660baeacfeb4c94e0dcbede5ae96e7be4355554023fcd204118e75fe40dL269>

### Version

15.1.1

### Expected behavior

Offline user sessions are displayed in the user's consent tab and can be revoked.

### Actual behavior

Click on user consents tab causes severe performacance issues and infinispan timeout exceptions and may even cause pods to get unhealthy or the service to crash completely.

### How to Reproduce?

* a lot of offline sessions (> 1 million)
* enable lazy loading of offline sessions
* create 2 offline sessions for 1 user (login with scope offline\_access)
* open admin UI, open user, click on consents tab

### Anything else?

*No response*
