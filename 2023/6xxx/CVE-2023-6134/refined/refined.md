{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `redirect_uri` validation logic in Keycloak does not properly handle wildcard characters, allowing a bypass of explicitly allowed hosts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of redirect URIs",
       "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal access tokens by using a crafted redirect URI. This can lead to impersonation of other users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Crafted OpenID Connect (OIDC) `redirect_uri` parameter during an authentication flow."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate the OIDC authentication flow with the vulnerable Keycloak instance and control the `redirect_uri` parameter.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability stems from a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs when a wildcard is used. Keycloak validates against a URL-decoded version of the URI, which may no longer represent the original input."
