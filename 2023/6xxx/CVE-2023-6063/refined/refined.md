The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6063.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `is_user_admin` function in the `WpFastestCacheCreateCache` class of the WP Fastest Cache plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function extracts a username from the `wordpress_logged_in` cookie and uses this value directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin fails to sanitize user input from a cookie before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Unauthenticated Access: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read the full contents of the WordPress database using a time-based blind SQL injection technique. This includes sensitive information such as user credentials, site configuration, and other stored data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted `wordpress_logged_in` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. No authentication or special privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
