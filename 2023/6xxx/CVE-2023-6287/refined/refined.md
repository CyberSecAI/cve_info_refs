- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The backup restore form used the GET method, causing the passphrase to be logged in the Apache access log.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passphrases were being transmitted via GET requests, which are typically logged in web server access logs. This exposes sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of the backup passphrase. An attacker with access to the web server logs could potentially gain access to the backup passphrase and potentially use it to compromise systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the web server's access logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need access to the server's `/var/log/apache2/access.log` file. This may require local access or, under certain circumstances, could be a result of other vulnerabilities.
