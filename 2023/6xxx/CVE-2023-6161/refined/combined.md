## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Crowdfunding < 2.1.9 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a "Campaign Search" widget to your site (via Appearance > Customise > Widgets for example)
2. Access the URL: https://www.example.com/?s="><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>&post\_type=product&product\_type=croudfunding
3. See the XSS.
