The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the /wp-json/lp/v1/profile/course-tab REST API due to missing validation on the 'userID' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve the details of another user's course progress.
