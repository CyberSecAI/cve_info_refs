- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the REST API calls of the Volkswagen ICAS3 IVI ECU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability that can crash the ICAS 3 IVI ECU.
    - Ability to spoof volume setting commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The DoS attack can crash the in-vehicle infotainment system.
    - An attacker can manipulate volume settings to set the audio volume to maximum irreversibly.
- **Attack vectors:** REST API calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send REST API calls to the ICAS3 IVI ECU. The provided text does not specify how this access is gained (e.g. physical access to the vehicle, compromised network etc)
