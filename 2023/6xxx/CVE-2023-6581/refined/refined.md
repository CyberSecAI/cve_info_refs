Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a backend SQL injection vulnerability present in the `workidajax.php` file of the D-LINK DAR-7000 series online behavior audit gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, which occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
    - Gain server privileges.
    - Cause business impact on the system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/user/inc/workidajax.php` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- They do not need to be authenticated, as no authentication is mentioned in the exploit details.
- The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to trigger a time-based SQL injection using the `sleep()` function.
- The attacker does not appear to need to be an administrator, as they can achieve exploitation with a simple HTTP POST request.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) shows that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection:
  ```
  POST /user/inc/workidajax.php HTTP/1.1
  Host: 58.18.133.60:8443
  Cookie: PHPSESSID=3e814ce27f6d6cdc6a2e910d27132338

  Content-Length: 69

  src=exempttraffic&type=del&id=(select*from(select(sleep(3)))a)&value=
  ```
- The `sleep(3)` function call within the injected SQL query demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, further confirming the presence of SQL injection.
