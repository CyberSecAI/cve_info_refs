- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin deserializes user input from cookies without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of user-controlled data via cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows unauthenticated users to perform PHP Object Injection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable gadget chain is present on the blog. The provided Proof of Concept shows that arbitrary deserialization can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted cookies, specifically the `es_wishlist` cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication and can be unauthenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send an HTTP request with a crafted cookie.
