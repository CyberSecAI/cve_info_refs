  "cve": "CVE-2023-6344",
  "source_description": "Tyler Technologies Court Case Management Plus allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to enumerate directories using the tiffserver/te003.aspx or te004.aspx 'ifolder' parameter. This behavior is related to the use of a deprecated version of Aquaforest TIFF Server, possibly 2.x.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a deprecated version of Aquaforest TIFF Server within Tyler Technologies' Court Case Management Plus. Specifically, the `te003.aspx` or `te004.aspx` endpoints, when combined with the `ifolder` parameter, allow for directory enumeration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a deprecated/vulnerable third-party component (Aquaforest TIFF Server)",
      "Insufficient input validation/sanitization of the `ifolder` parameter, allowing directory traversal or listing.",
      "Lack of proper access controls on the `te003.aspx` and `te004.aspx` endpoints, permitting unauthenticated access."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate directories on the server, potentially exposing sensitive file paths, system configuration information, and other confidential data. This can allow for further attacks by revealing accessible locations and the structure of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `te003.aspx` or `te004.aspx` endpoints within the application, using the `ifolder` parameter to specify directories for enumeration.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires no prior authentication or specialized knowledge other than how to send HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters. They need to know that a vulnerable Tyler Technologies product is being used and that the mentioned endpoints exist. The exploit can be done using any standard web browser or HTTP client. They can access the application through the public internet."
  },
  "additional_details": {
   "aquaforest_tiff_server_details" : "The vulnerability is related to the use of a deprecated version of Aquaforest TIFF Server, likely version 2.x, which has known vulnerabilities related to arbitrary file access and directory enumeration.  The vendor, Aquaforest, acknowledges the issue and has provided mitigation guidance (https://www.aquaforest.com/blog/tiff-server-security-update).",
     "tyler_technologies_response": "Tyler Technologies has acknowledged the vulnerability and claims to have fixed it around 2023-11-01.",
     "additional_cves": "This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in multiple court case and document management systems. Other related CVEs are: CVE-2023-6341, CVE-2023-6342, CVE-2023-6343, CVE-2023-6352, CVE-2023-6353, CVE-2023-6354, CVE-2023-6375, CVE-2023-6376.
