{
  "CVE-2023-6927": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is an open redirect issue in Keycloak's JARM response mode 'form_post.jwt'. An attacker can exploit this to steal authorization codes or tokens by using a wildcard in the redirect URI, bypassing security patches intended to address CVE-2023-6134.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of wildcard characters in the redirect URI when using the 'form_post.jwt' JARM response mode. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that bypasses redirect URI validation and redirects the user to an attacker-controlled domain.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Open Redirect",
	  "Bypass of redirect URI validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal authorization codes or tokens, leading to impersonation and unauthorized access to resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious URL with a wildcard in the redirect URI and uses the 'form_post.jwt' JARM response mode to bypass validation.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and initiate an authentication request with the vulnerable application, potentially requiring knowledge of an existing application configuration."
