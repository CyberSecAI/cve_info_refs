## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Review Slider < 13.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add the payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` for any of the WP Review > Twitter > API Keys or Twitter Source fields.
Save and see XSS when accessing the page.
