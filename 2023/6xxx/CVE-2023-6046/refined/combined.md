## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventON < 2.2 - Admin + Stored HTML Injection

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored HTML Injection attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the Virtual Event -> This is a virtual (online) event.
2. Configure Virtual Event Details -> On the second field, the URL field and insert '"><a href="https://miguelsantareno.github.io/resources.html">Clickme!</a> or '"><img src=X>click, and the HTML Injection Stored would appear.
