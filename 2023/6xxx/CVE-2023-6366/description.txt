In WhatsUp Gold versions released before 2023.1, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified.  It is possible for an attacker to craft a XSS payload and store that value within Alert Center. Â 

If a WhatsUp Gold user interacts with the crafted payload, the attacker would be able to execute malicious JavaScript within the context of the victims browser.
