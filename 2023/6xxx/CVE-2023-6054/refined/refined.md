Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$TERM_ID_STR` parameter within the `general/wiki/cp/manage/lock.php` script. When the `$TYPE` parameter is set to `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`, the `$TERM_ID_STR` value is directly concatenated into a SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
    *   **Direct Parameter Concatenation:** The code directly concatenates the `$TERM_ID_STR` parameter into the SQL statement.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. The provided examples show how to extract the database name using blind SQL injection techniques.
    *   **Potential for further attacks:** Successful exploitation can lead to further attacks, such as data modification or deletion, depending on the database user permissions.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `lock.php` script, including the malicious SQL injection code in the `TERM_ID_STR` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Basic knowledge of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The content provides example payloads to demonstrate the vulnerability and extract the database name using blind SQL injection techniques.
*   It shows how to perform a blind SQL injection to extract the database name character by character using `substr` and `char` functions in SQL.
