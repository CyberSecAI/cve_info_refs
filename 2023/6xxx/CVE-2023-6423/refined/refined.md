The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in BigProf products, specifically addressing CVE-2023-6423.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient encoding of user-controlled input within several BigProf products. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed, which enables the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker to store malicious JavaScript payloads within the system. When a user visits the affected page, the malicious script would execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Data exfiltration
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through web requests to the vulnerable application. The malicious payload is injected via a specific parameter (FirstRecord) in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious payload, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R`. This indicates the attack is over the network, has low complexity, requires no privilege and requires user interaction. An attacker would need to craft a malicious payload in the `FirstRecord` parameter of the request to the vulnerable pages. Then, a user would need to visit the page with the stored payload in order to be impacted.

**Specific Details for CVE-2023-6423:**

- Affected product: Online Clinic Management System 2.2
