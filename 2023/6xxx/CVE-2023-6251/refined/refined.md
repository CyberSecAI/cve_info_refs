- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of CSRF token validation when deleting user messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the endpoint for deleting user messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by another authenticated user, deletes the user's message without their consent. This could lead to loss of information (unread messages being deleted).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link containing the message UUID. The victim must be authenticated and tricked into opening this link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be authenticated, and able to craft a link with the target message UUID and needs to trick a user into opening the crafted malicious link.
