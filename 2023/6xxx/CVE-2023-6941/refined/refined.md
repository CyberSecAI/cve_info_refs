The provided content is related to CVE-2023-6941.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with admin privileges can store malicious scripts in plugin settings such as 'Opt in title', 'Opt in message', and 'Success Message text'. When other users (or the attacker) visits the website, the malicious script is executed.
