*   **Ability to submit a form**: The attacker only needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable form by submitting a crafted form input
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Formidable Forms plugin versions up to and including 6.7.
*   The fix is available in version 6.7.1.
