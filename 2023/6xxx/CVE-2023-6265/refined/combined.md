# Draytek vigor 2960 v1.5.1.4 has arbitrary file deletion vulnerability

## OverView

Product: Draytek Vigor 2960 v1.5.1.4(the newest version)
Firmware: v1.5.1.4 <https://fw.draytek.com.tw/Vigor2960/Firmware/v1.5.1.4/Vigor2960_v1.5.1.4.zip>

## Detail

function sub\_1DB3C contains arbitrary file deletion, in file `mainfunction.cgi`

It doesn’t filter var opion , so we can use /../ to path traversal. As a result, it will delete the specific file.
You can see the screenshot. The file etc/pptpd.conf is disappear, after we send poc.
