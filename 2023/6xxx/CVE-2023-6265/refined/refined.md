Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6265 (Although the description is a placeholder, the information aligns with the vulnerability described)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `mainfunction.cgi` script. Specifically, the `option` parameter is not sanitized, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `sub_1DB3C` function in `mainfunction.cgi` is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to the lack of input sanitization.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use `../` sequences in the `option` parameter to navigate the file system and delete arbitrary files.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The `sub_1DF14` function in `mainfunction.cgi` is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **File Deletion:** Attackers can delete critical system files, potentially causing denial of service and/or rendering the device unusable.
*  **File Read:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the device, potentially including configuration files, and private keys

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi`.
*   **`option` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `option`, which is used to specify the file path for deletion/reading

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it using path traversal.
*   **Session ID:** The attacker needs a valid `SESSION_ID_VIGOR` cookie.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `mainfunction.cgi` script of Draytek Vigor 2960 routers.
*   The affected firmware version is v1.5.1.4.
*   The `option` parameter in the HTTP request is used to specify the target file for deletion/reading.
*   The lack of input sanitization allows for path traversal using `../` sequences.

**PoC (Proof of Concept):**

The provided PoC demonstrates how to delete the `/etc/pptpd.conf` file:

```

```
**Additional Note:**
The information available from the provided text suggests that version 1.5.1.4 of the firmware for the Draytek Vigor 2960 is vulnerable.
Additionally, the Draytek website indicates that the Vigor2960 is an End-of-Life product as of 2021-12-09. This is important for mitigation considerations.
