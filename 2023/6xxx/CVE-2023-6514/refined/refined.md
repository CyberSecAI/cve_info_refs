- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An identity authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth module of some Huawei Smart Screen products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism when pairing via Bluetooth, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to access restricted functions on the affected Smart Screen device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via Bluetooth pairing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and successfully pair with the target device. No prior permissions are needed for pairing.
