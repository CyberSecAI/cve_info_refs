# Statement regarding CVE 2022-24198 and 2023-6298

The [CVE-2022-24198](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24198) and [CVE-2023-6298](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6298) reports claim there is an improper validation of array index in the iText library leading to a vulnerability.

This is not something we agree with at this point, since it is unclear what kind of exploit we can get.

We do confirm that the provided code samples trigger `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in our Java library and `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` in C#. But the fact that our code throws an exception is not by itself a vulnerability, and no case supporting that this behavior may be exploited has been presented to us.

Those vulnerability reports are linked to the weakness entries identified as [CWE-129](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html) and [CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html).

These weaknesses entries describe the following possible exploits in **C** and **C++** programming languages:

* Denial of Service: Crash, Exit, or Restart;

* Modify Memory;

* Read Memory;

* Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands;

* Bypass Protection Mechanism.

However iText is a **Java** and a **C#** library. Java and C# programming languages safeguard against listed exploits in case of out-of-bounds access by providing memory abstractions. Nothing related to unauthorized code/memory manipulation vulnerabilities is applicable here.

Both weakness records even point to using a language like Java or C# as a `Potential Mitigations` technique:

> For example, ... languages such as Java and Ruby will allow the programmer to handle exceptions when an out-of-bounds index is accessed.
>
> Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.

Additionally, throwing an exception on out-of-bounds array access does not lead to undefined behavior in those languages. The `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is a `java.lang.RuntimeException`, which can be captured and handled appropriately (this distinguishes it from `java.lang.Error` subclasses). The fact that the user of the library may not know that this exception can be thrown does not by itself mean that we have a vulnerability in the library, and that cannot be associated with a Denial of Service vulnerability in our opinion.
