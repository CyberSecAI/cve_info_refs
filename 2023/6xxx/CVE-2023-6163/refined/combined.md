## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Crowdfunding < 2.1.10 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Affected settings:
- Crowdfunding > Settings > WooCommerce Settings > Submit Form Agree Title
- Crowdfunding > Settings > General Settings > Redirect URL for User Registration Success
Payload: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
Save the affected settings with the payload and reload the page to trigger the XSS.
