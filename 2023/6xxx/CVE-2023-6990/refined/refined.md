### Summary of Vulnerability
The Weaver Xtreme theme for WordPress versions 6.3.0 and below is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability is present in the 'page-head-code' custom post meta. Authenticated attackers with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts, which will execute when a user accesses the affected page.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `page-head-code` custom meta field and insufficient output escaping when displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper input sanitization
- Insufficient output escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript injection
- Execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers
- Possible session hijacking or other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated users with contributor-level or higher permissions can add a custom meta field named `page-head-code` to a page or post and insert a malicious script.
- Whenever any user visits the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with at least contributor-level privileges to a WordPress site running the vulnerable theme.
- Ability to create or edit posts/pages and add/modify custom fields.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was patched in version 6.4 by removing support for the `page-head-code` custom field. The code changes show that the logic related to this custom field was removed from `admin-page-posts-meta-boxes.php`, `header-raw.php` and `includes/wphead.php` files.
- The `themes.trac.wordpress.org` content shows the commit that removes the vulnerable code and also the removal of the feature in the theme's documentation.
