{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by unbounded queuing of path validation messages due to the lack of proper limits in processing PATH_CHALLENGE frames.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unbounded queuing of path validation data. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the possibility of an unauthenticated remote attacker sending numerous PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection to slow down the sending of PATH_RESPONSE frames, resulting in an excessive accumulation of validation data in an unbounded queue.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause excessive resource consumption on a vulnerable server by forcing it to store large amounts of path validation data.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker sends PATH_CHALLENGE frames while simultaneously manipulating the connection in such a way as to restrict the peer's congestion window size, causing PATH_RESPONSE frames to be sent more slowly than PATH_CHALLENGE frames are received.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated QUIC packets to the target server and needs the ability to manipulate the connection to reduce the rate at which the server can send responses."
