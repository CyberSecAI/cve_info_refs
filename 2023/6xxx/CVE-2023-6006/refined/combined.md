info

In this bulletin we cover the security improvements addressed in PaperCut NG/MF version **23.0.1**.

For other Security vulnerability and Security bulletin information, see our [Security vulnerability information and common security questions](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/CommonSecurityQuestions/) page.

**Sep 2024 update:**

CVE-2023-6006 has been rescored.

This rescore is **NOT** due to previously unknown paths of attack and this issue remains fixed as of PaperCut NG/MF 23.0.1.

## Security Issues Addressed

### Privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2023-6006)

(also known as PIE-547).

We want to thank the security researchers at Trend Micro (Amol Dosanjh of Trend Micro and Michael DePlante of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative) who reported: “This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of PaperCut NG. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.”

A potential exploit would require **all** of the following to be true:

* PaperCut NG/MF Application Server (earlier than version 23.0.1) is running on a Windows platform (macOS and Linux are not impacted by this vulnerability).
* Malicious actor has write access to the Application Server’s local hard drive.
* Malicious actor has the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target server.
* [Print Archiving](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/sys-archive-setting-up/) feature is enabled, *without* GhostTrap installed.

This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of **7.8**[1]: (CVSSv3 Vector: [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&amp;version=3.1))

Note: Trend Micro are looking to publicly disclose additional information about this. While the Trend Micro advisory may only mention PaperCut NG, we have confirmed that this impacts both PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF (see [Impacted Product Status](#impacted-product-status) table below).

[1] Sep 2024: Scoring amended.

We publicly released PaperCut MF and NG version 23.0.1 on 31st October, 2023. This security bulletin and information about CVE-2023-6006 was then published on 14th November 2023. This delay was so that customers can have a head-start on upgrading to a non-vulnerable version.

We have now retroactively added the release note for PIE-547 into the [23.0.1 release notes](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/release-history/23-0/#v23-0-1), and published this security bulletin including details of the manual mitigation.

## FAQs

Q Where can I get the upgrade?

The **Check for updates** button in the PaperCut NG/MF admin interface allows customers to download the latest version of PaperCut NG or MF. You will find this at **PaperCut NG/MF Admin interface > About > Version info > Check for updates**.

You can also find your PaperCut partner or reseller information on the Help tab (or About tab in older versions) on the PaperCut Web admin interface.

Alternatively, direct downloads are available on the [upgrade page](https://www.papercut.com/products/upgrade/). It’s easy to identify your edition of PaperCut - it’s on the **About** tab and in the footer of your PaperCut Web admin login.

Q How do I tell if my Application Server is at risk?

**All** of the following need to be true for your Application Server to be at risk:

* PaperCut NG/MF Application Server (earlier than version 23.0.1) is running on a Windows platform (macOS and Linux are not impacted by this vulnerability).
* Malicious actor has write access to the Application Server’s local hard drive.
* Malicious actor has the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target server.
* [Print Archiving](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/sys-archive-setting-up/) feature is enabled, *without* GhostTrap installed.

Q How do I tell if I am using the Print Archiving feature?

In the PaperCut NG/MF admin interface, go to **Options > General > Print Archiving**.

* If the **Enable Print Archiving** checkbox is *not* checked, then you are not using Print Archiving, and this vulnerability cannot be exploited.
* If the **Enable Print Archiving** checkbox *is* checked, then you are using Print Archiving and the vulnerability could potentially be exploited if all of the other points above in “How do I tell if my Application Server is at risk” are true.

Q If I am using Print Archiving, how do I tell if I have installed GhostTrap?

In the PaperCut NG/MF admin interface, go to **Options > General > Print Archiving**. In the Status box, check to see what is listed next to the **Viewing supported** for line:

* If **Viewing supported for** lists e.g. `EMF, PCL5, PCL6, PDF, PostScript, XPS` then GhostTrap is installed, and this vulnerability cannot be exploited.
* If **Viewing supported for** only lists e.g. `PDF, PostScript` then GhostTrap is not installed, and this vulnerability could be exploited, if all of the other points above in [How do I tell if my Application Server is at risk?](#application-server-at-risk) are true.

Q How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

If all of the points under [How do I tell if my Application Server is at risk?](#application-server-at-risk) are true, there are several options to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Upgrade your Application Server to version 23.0.1 or later (see [Where can I get the upgrade?](#where-to-get-upgrade) above).
2. If you’re unable to upgrade to version 23.0.1 or later, and turning off Print Archiving is an option, you can switch that off under **Options > General > Print Archiving**, then uncheck **Enable Print Archiving**.
3. If you’re unable to upgrade to version 23.0.1 or later, and you need to continue using Print Archiving, then ensure ghostTrap is installed in `C:\Program Files\GhostTrap`. See [Set up Print Archiving](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/sys-archive-setting-up/) (Step 1) for more information.
4. If you’re unable to upgrade to version 23.0.1 or later, and you need to continue using Print Archiving, and you don’t want to install GhostTrap, then you can create a directory on your Application Server file system: `C:\gs\bin` and remove **write permissions** for all accounts except administrators.
5. If none of the above suit your environment, you can download a fixed version of the `pc-pdl-to-image.exe` and replace it on your Application Server. See [How do I manually replace the pc-pdl-to-image.exe binary?](#manual-replacement) below for more information.

Q How do I manually replace the pc-pdl-to-image.exe binary?

**Only** use this fix if you have looked through the section [How do I mitigate this vulnerability](#how-to-mitigate) above, and Option 5 is the only option you’re able to implement.

**Note**: if you are using PaperCut NG or MF version 23.0.1 or later, you do **not** need to perform these steps - you already have the latest patched version.

1. Download the updated (patched) `pc-pdl-to-image.exe` binary from the PaperCut CDN: <https://cdn.papercut.com/files/general/pc-pdl-to-image.zip>.
2. Unzip `pc-pdl-to-image.zip` to get the `pc-pdl-to-image.exe` binary. (If you wish to verify the SHA256 checksum this is: `5be6a8a817a3fc30fb4a56bff527b51a452d8d84ae1d3d5632d83d2674bcbbb6`).
3. In `[App Server install directory]\server\bin\win` (e.g. C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\server\bin\win) rename `pc-pdl-to-image.exe` to `pc-pdl-to-image.bak`
4. Copy the downloaded (patched) `pc-pdl-to-image.exe` to `[App Server install directory]\server\bin\win\`.

*Note 1*: A service restart is **not** required for this change to take effect.

*Note 2*: If you subsequently upgrade to any other version earlier than 23.0.1 (e.g. if you apply this mitigation on 22.1.3, then you upgrade from 22.1.3 to 22.1.4) you will need to re-apply this mitigation - since the replaced binary will be re-written with an unpatched one.

*Note 3*: If you are upgrading to 23.0.1 or later, you will **not** need to apply this manual mitigation since the fix is included in 23.0.1 and later.

*Note 4*: The full list of fixes for the patched executable include:

* Fix for CVE-2023-39471 (the vulnerability described above) [PIE-547] (fixed in PaperCut [NG](https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/release-history/23-0/#v23-0-1) and [MF](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/release-history/23-0/#v23-0-1) version 23.0.1).
* Fix for an issue that caused thumbnail image generation to fail for archived PostScript spool files. [PIE-216] (fixed in PaperCut [NG](https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/release-history/22-0/#v22-0-9) and [MF](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/release-history/22-0/#v22-0-9) version 22.0.9).

Q What products are impacted by these vulnerabilities?

See the [Impacted Product Status](#impacted-product-status) section above for a detailed list.

Q I am running a 20.x, 21.x or 22.x version - is there an updated build containing the fix?

No - since this vulnerability can be mitigated using multiple options (see [How do I mitigate this vulnerability?](#how-to-mitigate) above) this fix will only be included in 23.0.1 and later.

Q Is there anything I should be aware of before applying the upgrade?

Yes, potentially. If you are upgrading from a version prior to 22.1.1 you should read the [upgrade checklist for 22.1.1](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/22-1-1-upgrade-checklist). If you’re already on version 22.1.1 or later, you don’t need to check through this again.

Q I am running an old version. Do I need to upgrade to a prior version before upgrading to 23.0.1?

No. This release includes all previous fixes released, and you can upgrade directly to this release from any previous version of PaperCut NG/MF.

Q Why did PaperCut retroactively update a CVE that was already published?

When we receive a security issue report, we carefully assess the vulnerability and score it based on the examples provided in First.

After extensive conversations with researchers who reported this issue, we agreed that in most installations, the default Windows Server configuration would typically restrict console login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log in to the local console of the PaperCut NG/MF application server hosted on Windows, either through deliberate actions, misconfiguration or other vulnerabilities allowing users to access the server.

Based on this information, the CVE has been rescored with a “Privileges Required (PR)” rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard users on the host server. This rescore is **NOT** due to new paths of attack and this issue remains fixed as of PaperCut NG/MF 23.0.1.

## General security questions

Q Is there a way to subscribe to PaperCut Security alerts and updates?

Yes! If you need to make sure you receive critical security notifications, sign up for email alerts using the [Subscribe to security notifications](https://www.papercut.com/contact/security/#subscribe) signup form.

Q Does PaperCut have a print security best practice checklist?

Absolutely! We have pooled our knowledge and created a comprehensive Print Security whitepaper that will help you not only make the most of PaperCut’s security features but also help you secure your entire print infrastructure. Take a look at: [PaperCut Security white paper](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/SecurityWhitepaper).

Q What about advice on securing our PaperCut server?

We’re glad you asked. Our article, [Secure your PaperCut NG/MF server](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/SecureYourPaperCutServer), collects all our best advice for security-conscious customers about locking down your PaperCut application server.

Q What versions of PaperCut NG/MF still receive security updates?

If you’re not running the latest version of PaperCut NG/MF, you can find out which previous versions will receive security updates.

See our [Support inclusions for each Major version](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/papercut-ng-mf-supported-versions-policy#support-inclusions-for-each-major-version) section, which documents which supported versions will get feature/bug fixes, and which supported versions will get critical security updates.

Q Does PaperCut store any passwords?

User authentication is performed by the operating system - usually via a directory service such as Active Directory or LDAP. PaperCut does not store any user passwords and instead interrogates the directory service in real-time. Caching or storing passwords is regarded as a security risk. The only exceptions to this rule are the built-in *admin* user account and PaperCut internal accounts.

The built-in *admin* password is stored in a one-way salted hashed format in the `server.properties` file. This account is kept separate from the directory user accounts ensuring that administrator level login is still possible even during a directory outage.

Internal user passwords are stored in the PaperCut database as a one-way hash in line with security best practice - a BCrypt sum factored from a combination of username + password + a salt. This use of a secure one-way hash ensures that users’ passwords are kept private even if someone has access to the PaperCut database.

In addition, PaperCut also encrypts all user’s Personal Identification Numbers used to secure card numbers.

Q How does PaperCut authenticate with Active Directory?

Communication between the PaperCut server and Active Directory (AD) is provided and secured by the Windows operating system. PaperCut calls the AD API on the local Windows system, and the PaperCut software does not collect passwords over the network to any remote server, as this is handled by AD itself.

PaperCut does not store any user passwords and instead interrogates the directory service in real-time, as caching or storing passwords is regarded as a security risk. The only exceptions to this rule are the built-in admin user account and PaperCut internal accounts which are covered above.

Q What level of encryption does PaperCut use?

Client-server communication of sensitive data is conducted over a TLS link - this is an equivalent level of encryption to that used by a web browser connected on an *https://* website.

Q I am going to use Popup Authentication. What should I consider?

Popup-authentication is another means that PaperCut can use to authenticate users at the time of printing using the PaperCut User Client. This topic and it’s security considerations are discussed in detail in the article [Popup authentication](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/applicationserver/printer-popup-auth/).

Q Does PaperCut use Secure and HttpOnly secured cookies?

Yes. As of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF 17.1, all session cookies generated for access attempts over secure connections are marked as both Secure and HtmlOnly in order to help mitigate a number of potential risks, such as certain styles of XSS attack, as well as the interception of secure session data improperly transmitted in cleartext.

Q Can I open port 9191/9192 to the world?

Best practice suggests not exposing any services to the Internet unless required. Having said that, we have designed PaperCut to be secure and with the intention of our users opening the HTTPS port 9192 to the Internet to facilitate services such as:

* Remote administration
* Allowing end-users to login from home to check balances and add credit/quota to their accounts

We have a number of large University/College sites that have opened up PaperCut’s port to the Internet since 2005. It is recommended to open port 9192 (the TLS port) rather than the plain text port 9191.

Q Is PaperCut and associated executable given minimum permission needed for operation? Is the concept of least privilege upheld?

Yes. On Windows, Mac, Novell and Linux PaperCut have been designed to run under non-privileged accounts. Key security processes on Linux that need to be run with elevated privileges such as those used for user authentication are run “out of process” so these higher privileges rights are isolated at the process level. On Windows, PaperCut’s runs its main process as the SYSTEM account with local access only (no network resource access).

Q How can I restrict access to the XML Web Service APIs?

Two levels of access control is provided for the web services APIs. The first is that any call needs to pass a valid authentication token (usually the built-in *admin* user’s password). All calls not passing this will be rejected. The 2nd level of security is IP address level filtering. By default, PaperCut will only allow calls from `localhost` (127.0.0.1), and optionally this can be extended to other servers by manually granting that server’s IP address. Valid IP addresses/ranges are defined under the *Options* section.

Q Are administrator activities audited?

Yes. As a general rule most major operations such as editing printer details, creating/deleting/modifying user accounts are audited. These audit records appear in the App. Log with a date, details and the user who performed the operation. Having said that, a full level system administrator with read/write file access could in theory edit the data files directory to modify the audit trail. Standard limited-rights PaperCut-only administrators access via the web interface can not modify these records.

Q What about the security of any 3rd party libraries and components used by PaperCut?

PaperCut makes use of a number of third party libraries and components. The security of components is actively monitored by our development team and if any are raised, we assess the impact this may have. We take the topic of security for any 3rd component as serious as we do for our own codebase. In some situations, we have worked with the 3rd party vendors to address security issues. Another example of active 3rd party security management is the [Ghost Trap](https://github.com/codedance/GhostTrap) project. This initiative was started by PaperCut and aims to bring best of breed security to the Ghostscript PDL interpreters.

Q Do PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF support the use of digital signatures for printed documents?

Our document [watermarking functionality](https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/manual/applicationserver/topics/printer-watermarking.html) can be easily leveraged to inject a digital signature into every printed page. This signature is generated by combining key print job attributes (e.g. time of print, username, printer name, document name) with a secret key, using a cryptographic algorithm to create an encoded string that is unique for each document. Both the MD5 and SHA1 message digest algorithms are available to transform these elements into unique signature strings, allowing the degree of cryptographic security to be configured. The resulting signatures can be used to trace printed pages back to their users of origin, allowing you to follow-up undesired or unlawful transmission of classified content.

As of version 17.1 of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF, watermarks can be applied across the full page, such that signatures are visible over the entire printed document. This renders the removal of a signature from the printed page impossible.

Q Some areas of the user interface suggest that the software occasionally contacts PaperCut servers to retrieve information; for example, when I click to Check for updates on the About tab in the Admin web interface. Is this outbound communication performed securely?

In the past, contact to PaperCut servers to check for updates, send error reports on user commands, or download news content was performed over regular HTTP. From version 17.2.3 forwards of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF, all outbound contact is made using HTTPS, minimizing the risk of these communications being intercepted.

Q I’ve noticed that system error pages contain some diagnostic information. Is this anything to be concerned about?

Prior to version 17.3 of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF, HTML error pages would provide some technical context for the error, in order to aid diagnosis of the cause. Amongst the context provided was basic system information, which for highly secure environments could be considered to be unnecessary exposure. From 17.3 onwards, PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF will default to only outputting stack trace data when generating these error pages, eliding any information which could be considered identifying.

Q Configuring the Web Print feature to support Microsoft Office documents involves installing Office on my Web Print Server/s. Does the submission of documents that contain embedded macros present a security risk?

To establish support for Office documents, we recommend that Web Print be configured in “Sandbox Mode”. This partitions the running of the Web Print service off to one or more Web Print Servers; machines distinct from the key components of the PaperCut MF or PaperCut NG solution architecture, which are minimally configured and wholly dedicated to their task. By doing so, the opening and rendering of Office documents is contained to only these standalone servers, and if one of these machines is then compromised, only transient document data is potentially exposed. The afflicted Web Print Server can then be torn down and restored from a basic system image, removing the threat in the process.

Furthermore, Web Print Servers running version 17.4.2 or later of PaperCut MF and PaperCut NG can disallow the execution of any embedded document macros. This is controlled with the `web-print.disable-macros` configuration key, accessible via the [Config Editor](https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/manual/common/topics/sys-config-editor.html). This should minimise the possibility of document-borne attacks impacting your Web Print setup.

## Security standards and frameworks

Q Is PaperCut certified under security standard XYZ?

PaperCut is developed in line with leading security guidelines and practices. For an overview have a look at our article [Tell me about PaperCut’s security](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Security).

PaperCut is also ISO/IEC 27001-2022 certified (commonly referred to as [ISO 27001](https://www.vanta.com/landing/iso-27001) certification). To view our certification, visit our [Trust Portal](https://trust.papercut.com/ "Trust Portal").

With the well-justified increased industry focus on security PaperCut Software is continuously working to formalize our security practices:

* Our Security Response Team (SRT) led by our Head of Development provides personalized and timely responses by our security specialists to any reported issues.
* We work with external security consultants to audit our security policies and practices in general, as well as the specific technologies and architectures used to protect customer information in PaperCut NG and MF.
* PaperCut customers and prospects are regularly PEN testing and auditing our software and we give high priority to fixing any vulnerabilities found.

Q Is PaperCut PCI Certified?

PaperCut itself does not handle any credit card transactions directly and hence PCI certification is not required/not appropriate for PaperCut itself.

PaperCut interfaces with 3rd party payment gateways to handle credit card transactions (e.g. [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/), [CyberSource](http://www.cybersource.com/), [Authorize.Net](http://www.authorize.net/), etc.) and all credit card gateways/providers supported by PaperCut are PCI DSS certified.

When a user makes a payment they are directed through to the provider’s “hosted pay page” and credit card details are entered on their website directly.

Please [follow this link](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/PCICompliance) for more detail on PaperCut and PCI DSS v3.

Q PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF stores information about my printing users… can the application be compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?

The [EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/) mandates that users have a Right to Access all stored data associated with them, as well as the Right to be Forgotten; to have all identifiable data related to them which is stored by an organisation permanently removed upon request. This is a significant seachange, reflecting the ever-increasing emphasis placed on securing and protecting personal data within information systems.

As of version 17.2, we have implemented methods that empower an organisation to meet these requirements with respect to their print system. Understanding that total compliance with GDPR is of critical importance to organisations operating within the EU, we’ve also sought to ease the burden of transition by authoring a GDPR Compliance Guide to help you along the way!

For further information, check out our article on [GDPR](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/GDPR).

Q Our security scanner or penetration test has warned us about some issues with our PaperCut server. How do we resolve these?

PaperCut is in use in tens of thousands of organizations and many of them use various security analysis and scanning tools. A security analysis tool like Nessus might identify issues, particularly with older PaperCut servers that have not yet been upgraded.

The solution might entail upgrading PaperCut NG/MF, configuring PaperCut NG/MF to use a signed certificate, or changing some other setting. Other times the warning may be for something else running on the server, rather than PaperCut NG or MF.

Information about hardening your PaperCut NG/MF server can be found in our article [Secure your PaperCut NG/MF server](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/SecureYourPaperCutServer/).

Of course the security landscape is a frequently changing one. If you’ve already read through the above article and still have any doubts or concerns please visit our [Support portal](https://www.papercut.com/support/) to get in contact.

Q Is PaperCut susceptible to SQL Injection attacks?

Our coding standard and design policies are designed to limit this type of attack. All database queries in PaperCut are developed using parameterized SQL. This means that PaperCut never directly builds the SQL statement using data provided by the user (e.g. search terms entered in fields). All SQL parameters are handled by the underlying database library which means that PaperCut is not susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

Q Does the application have protections against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks?

A number of preventative measures against common [CSRF attack vectors](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) are implemented in PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF, seeking to ensure that an individual cannot modify HTTP request content in such a way that grants elevated access to system information or configuration. For example, as of version 17.3, header-based checks are enabled by default, validating the request origin by cross-checking the supplied origin and destination headers, and denying requests with unknown origin.
