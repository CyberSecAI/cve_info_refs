  "CVE-2023-6006": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of PaperCut NG. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to how PaperCut NG/MF processes print jobs when the Print Archiving feature is enabled without GhostTrap installed. This allows a local attacker to escalate privileges via a malicious file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation",
      "Improper Handling of Print Jobs",
       "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers can escalate their privileges on affected Windows installations of PaperCut NG/MF, potentially gaining full control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local Access",
       "Exploitation of the Print Archiving feature"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target Windows server.",
      "Write access to the Application Server’s local hard drive.",
       "Print Archiving enabled *without* GhostTrap installed"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects only PaperCut NG/MF Application Servers running on Windows. It does not impact macOS or Linux. A potential exploit would require a malicious actor to have write access to the Application Server’s local hard drive, the ability to execute low-privileged code, and have the Print Archiving feature enabled *without* GhostTrap installed. The vulnerability is fixed in version 23.0.1 and later."
