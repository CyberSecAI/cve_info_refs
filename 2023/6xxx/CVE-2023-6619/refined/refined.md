```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within the `class_form.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/php-attendance/modals/class_form.php` file. The `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, retrieve the entire database content, modify or delete records, potentially execute operating system commands, and launch further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/php-attendance/modals/class_form.php` with a malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not appear to need prior authentication."
