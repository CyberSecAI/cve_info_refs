- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape generated URLs before outputting them within HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to user data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript code, an attacker can trick a user into visiting the URL which will then execute the malicious script within the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click the link, or otherwise access the malicious URL through other means. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
