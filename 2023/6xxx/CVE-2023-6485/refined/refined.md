- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some player settings. Additionally, there are missing capability checks, allowing low-privileged users to modify these settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the player settings. When a high-privileged user, such as an admin, views the player lists, the malicious scripts execute in their browser, potentially leading to actions performed with the admin's privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `h5vp_import_data` action. The `content` parameter within the POST request contains the malicious script encoded as a JSON string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user, even with low privileges like a subscriber. They also need access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
