The content provided details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `student_form.php` file of the Simple Student Attendance System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `student_form.php` file. Specifically the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability.
- The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Attackers can retrieve the entire database content.
- Attackers can add, modify, or delete records, affecting data integrity.
- In some cases, attackers can execute operating system commands, leading to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `student_form.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- Access to the student management page.
- Ability to capture network traffic to observe data packets.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker modifies the `id` parameter in the POST request sent to `student_form.php`.
- The modified request injects SQL code into the query, allowing the attacker to manipulate the database.
- Example payload: `id=-1' union select 1,2,user(),4,5,6#`
