{
  "CVE-2023-6610": {
    "Description": "The kernel has an OOB access in smb2_dump_detail. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the `smb2_dump_detail` function. This occurs due to an unchecked value being used as an index to the `has_smb2_data_area` array.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a system crash or leak internal kernel memory, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack can be initiated by a local attacker who can trigger a specific SMB operation that eventually calls `smb2_dump_detail` function in the kernel.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the local system. They also need to be able to cause a condition where `cifs_demultiplex_thread` is called, with `CONFIG_CIFS_DEBUG2` enabled, which then calls the vulnerable  `smb2_dump_detail` function and pass an crafted smb command to that function that is out of bounds."
