Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Type Juggling Issue:** The vulnerability stems from a type juggling issue in the `connect-app` REST API endpoint. Specifically, the code uses a loose comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`) when validating the authentication key, which can lead to type juggling vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the type juggling vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by providing a different data type that evaluates to true during a loose comparison with the expected nonce.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The `/connect-app` endpoint uses `__return_true` for the 'permission\_callback', making it accessible without any authentication checks.
*   **Missing Input Sanitization:** The `connect_app` function appears to lack proper input sanitization for the `auth_key` header, further increasing the risk of exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **API Key Reset:** Attackers can reset the API key used for authentication with the mobile app, effectively taking control of the mobile app's access to the plugin.
*   **Data Access:** With the ability to reset the key, attackers can view sensitive data, including logs of sent emails, which could include password reset links, and other sensitive content.
*   **Site Takeover:** By gaining access to password reset emails, attackers can potentially take over the WordPress site.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can also modify data by using the hijacked connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated API Request:** Attackers send a malicious crafted request to the `/connect-app` endpoint.
*   **Manipulation of auth_key Header:** The attacker manipulates the `auth_key` header by providing a value that can bypass the type check.
*   **Leveraging REST API:** The vulnerability is triggered via the REST API exposed by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Understanding of HTTP headers:** Attacker must have knowledge on how to inject manipulated values in HTTP headers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.8.7.
*   The fix was introduced in version 2.8.8, which included the change to a strict comparison (`===`) in line 68 in the `rest-api.php` file and sanitization of the input
*   CVE-2023-52233 is reported as a duplicate of this issue.
