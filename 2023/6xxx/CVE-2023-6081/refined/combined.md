## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Chart.js for WordPress <= 2023.2 - Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting in New Chart

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Charts > New Chart > HTML
3. Insert the following payload: "-alert("asifensergen-waren-hier ")-"
5. Click on Save.
6. You can see the stored XSS on: https://example.com/charts/chartjs

### Affects Plugins
