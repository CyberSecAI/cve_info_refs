The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6048.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Estatik Real Estate Plugin before version 4.1.1 does not properly restrict access to site options, allowing low-privileged users (such as subscribers) to modify them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to implement proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to modify site options. Specifically, it does not prevent subscribers from setting any of the site's options to 1.
- **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization, allowing users to perform actions they should not be permitted to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By resetting certain options, attackers can break the site's functionality, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Site disruption:** Modification of arbitrary site options could lead to unpredictable behavior and damage to the integrity of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `es_dismiss_notices` and a crafted `notice` parameter within the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a user account with subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability using a web browser's developer console.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c (CERT PL).
- The CVSS score is 7.1 (high) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H.
- The issue is fixed in version 4.1.1 of the plugin.
