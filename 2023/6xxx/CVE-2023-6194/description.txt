In Eclipse Memory Analyzer versions 0.7 to 1.14.0, report definition XML files are not filtered to prohibit
document type definition (DTD) references to external entities.
This means that if a user chooses to use a malicious report definition XML file containing an external entity reference
to generate a report then Eclipse Memory Analyzer may access external files or URLs defined via a DTD in the report definition.
