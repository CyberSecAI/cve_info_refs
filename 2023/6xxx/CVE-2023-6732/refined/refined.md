- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker, with administrative privileges, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected plugin settings.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding or editing a category in the plugin's Marker Categories settings, an attacker can inject a malicious script in the title field. The XSS is triggered when editing the related category again.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges such as admin to access the plugin settings.
