## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate Maps by Supsystic < 1.2.16 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Go to the Marker Categories settings of the plugin (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ultimate-maps-supsystic&tab=marker\_groups), add/edit a category and put the following payload as a title: text"autofocus/onfocus=alert(1)//
The XSS will be triggered when editing the related category again
