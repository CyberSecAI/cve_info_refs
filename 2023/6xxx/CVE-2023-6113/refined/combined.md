## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory **/wordpress/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/tmp/**. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential **brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system**.

## **Understanding of Directory Listing / Account Takeover attack’s**

**Directory Listing** is a technique where attackers can view the contents of a website’s directories. In the context of WordPress, this could mean access to confidential files, including **Database**, which is pivotal for database access and site management.

Real-world example: A hacker, leveraging **Directory Listing**, discovers and downloads password-containing files, granting them full control over the site.

## **Exploiting the **Directory Listing** Vulnerability**

Malevolent actors, utilizing **Directory Listing**, can gain access to files containing passwords and other confidential data. Consequently, they can execute an Account Takeover, seizing control of the web resource. This opens doors to injecting malicious code, blocking access, and other critical actions.

> **POC**:
>
> 1) It is necessary that either the administrator or auto-backup works automatically at the scheduled time
>
> 2) Exploit will send file search requests every 5 seconds
>
> 3) I attack the site with this vulnerability using an exploit
>
> Exploit sends a request to the server every 5 seconds along the path “**http://your\_site/wordpress/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/tmp/”** and if it finds something in the index of, it instantly parses all the data and displays it on the screen

> >                 print(file_name)
> >                 file_content = get_file_content(url, file_name)
> >
> >                 if file_content is not None:
> >                     print("File content:")

> \_\_\_

The risk involves not only the loss of confidential data but also reputation degradation, loss of control over content, and potential fraudulent activities. A real-world scenario is an attacker gaining access to **Database**, leading to the loss of vital data and site lockdown.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

* **Software Updates:** Regularly update Duplicator and other WordPress components.
* **Access Restriction:** Regulate access rights to directories, especially those containing confidential files.
* **Activity Monitoring:** Utilize monitoring tools to track suspicious activity.
* **Backups:** Regularly backup data for swift recovery post incidents.
* **Access Blocking:** Implement tools that can automatically block access to directories upon detecting suspicious activity.

[![CVE-2024-11849 – Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields – Stored XSS to JS Backdoor Creation – POC](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/New_1_not_safe-1.png "CVE-2024-11849 – Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields – Stored XSS to JS Backdoor Creation – POC")](https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-11849/ "CVE-2024-11849 – Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields – Stored XSS to JS Backdoor Creation – POC")

Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields is a popular WordPress plugin that allows users to create and manage custom content types and fields. However, a serious Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, CVE-2024-11849, has been discovered in the plugin. This flaw allows an attacker with editor-level privileges to inject malicious JavaScript into the “Add Button Text” field within the plugin’s “File / Image / Video/ Options” settings. The injected script can then be executed when the settings page is accessed, leading to the creation of a backdoor and potentially allowing attackers to hijack an admin session or escalate their privileges. With over 100,000 active installations, this vulnerability represents a significant security threat for WordPress websites using Pods.

[![CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/New_1_not_safe-1.png "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")](https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-12280/ "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")

WP Customer Area is a versatile and modular WordPress plugin designed to provide a private content management solution. With features like sharing files and pages with specific users or groups, it has become a preferred choice for managing confidential content in WordPress websites. However, in version 8.2.4 and earlier, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered, which allows unauthorized users to delete event logs without proper authentication.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as logs often contain critical records of user actions and system events. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could erase these logs, effectively covering their tracks and compromising a site’s ability to identify malicious activities. Notably, the plugin is now discontinued, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to alternative solutions.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Staging (Free < 3.1.3, Pro < 5.1.3) - Unauthenticated Backup Download

### Description

The plugin does not prevent visitors from leaking key information about ongoing backups processes, allowing unauthenticated attackers to download said backups later.

### Proof of Concept

The plugin creates temporary cache files when backing up sites, which are publicly accessible to anyone. Said cache files contain critical information (such as a backup's secret ID), allowing attackers to find and download the resulting backup files.
While running a new backup (or one automatically runs!), try to get ahold of the following cache file:
https://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/cache/jobCache\_backup\_job.cache
Once this is done, you will find the resulting backup file at https://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/backups/vulnerable-site.tld\_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS\_SECRETID.wpstg
You can find the date ("YYMMDD"), the time ("HHMMSS") and SECRETID in the information leaked from the cache file.

# CVE-2023-6113 – WP Staging – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Account Takeover – POC/Exploit

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-6113 – WP Staging – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Account Takeover – POC/Exploit

A **critical vulnerability** has been uncovered in the **WP Staging plugin** within the directory **/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/cache.** This vulnerability exposes comprehensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files. More alarmingly, it allows unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, making it a high-risk security flaw. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including potential brute force attacks on **password hashes and the compromise of the entire system**.

## **Timeline**

| November 10, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **WP Staging** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| November 10, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| November 15, 2023 | The author fixed the vulnerability and released the plugin update |
| November X, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-6113** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory **/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/cache**. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system.

## **Understanding of Directory Listing / Account Takeover attack’s**

**Directory listing** refers to the capability of a web server to display the contents of a directory when an index file is absent. In WordPress, this feature can inadvertently expose sensitive information if not properly configured. In the case of the **WP Staging plugin**, the vulnerability lies in the directory **/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/cache**, where directory listing is not adequately controlled. Real-world examples demonstrate that attackers can exploit this flaw to gain insight into the site’s structure and, more importantly, access sensitive data.

## **Exploiting the **Directory Listing** Vulnerability**

Exploiting the **WP Staging vulnerability involves leveraging the exposed directory listing to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data**. Attackers can use this information to target specific files, including those containing password hashes. With access to password hashes, attackers may launch brute force attacks, attempting to crack passwords and gain control of user accounts, potentially leading to a full account takeover.

> **POC**:
>
> 1) The plugin has the ability to automatically backup every 12 hours (in free version only in 00:00 – attacker can start exploit at 23:55), but for the speed of the POC, I will do it manually, but this is similar to automatic scanning.
>
> 2) There is a lot of sensitive data and most importantly, you can download a backup file and upload it to your local car:

The potential risk associated with this vulnerability is severe. In real-world scenarios, attackers can exploit the exposed directory to perform reconnaissance on the site’s structure and locate critical files. Subsequently, they may target the database to retrieve sensitive information, compromising user data, passwords, and potentially gaining control of administrative accounts. This could lead to **unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other malicious activities**.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

* **Directory Indexing Configuration:** Disable directory indexing for sensitive directories, ensuring that web servers do not disclose the contents of directories.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities promptly.
* **Plugin Patching:** Ensure that the WP Staging plugin is up-to-date with the latest security patches to address this vulnerability.
* **Database Encryption:** Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database to protect it even if unauthorized access occurs.

> By implementing these security measures, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure associated with the **WP Staging** vulnerability.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Staging (Free < 3.1.3, Pro < 5.1.3) - Unauthenticated Backup Download

### Description

The plugin does not prevent visitors from leaking key information about ongoing backups processes, allowing unauthenticated attackers to download said backups later.

### Proof of Concept

The plugin creates temporary cache files when backing up sites, which are publicly accessible to anyone. Said cache files contain critical information (such as a backup's secret ID), allowing attackers to find and download the resulting backup files.
While running a new backup (or one automatically runs!), try to get ahold of the following cache file:
https://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/cache/jobCache\_backup\_job.cache
Once this is done, you will find the resulting backup file at https://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-content/uploads/wp-staging/backups/vulnerable-site.tld\_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS\_SECRETID.wpstg
You can find the date ("YYMMDD"), the time ("HHMMSS") and SECRETID in the information leaked from the cache file.
