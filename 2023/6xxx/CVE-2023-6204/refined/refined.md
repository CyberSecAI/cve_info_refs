Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-6204:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `blitFramebuffer` function of WebGL2, specifically in the `BlitD24S8ToD32F` function. This function is used to copy data between framebuffers.
- The vulnerability arises because the calculation of the source pixel offset does not correctly validate the row and column values against the actual dimensions of the source buffer. It uses the canvas object dimensions instead of the renderbuffer dimensions.
- This leads to reading beyond the allocated memory of the source data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is that the code reads memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This allows for the potential leakage of sensitive memory data.
- **Incorrect Validation:** The bounds checking is flawed, comparing the row and column with the canvas dimensions instead of the renderbuffer dimensions.
- **`KHR_no_error` flag:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the `KHR_no_error` extension in ANGLE (the graphics abstraction layer used by Firefox) because this extension disables error checking and validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary impact is the ability to leak memory data into the images created on the canvas element. This information could be related to other sites or sensitive data of the application.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The leaked memory could, under certain circumstances, expose data that could be further exploited to take over the GPU or parent process. This elevates the severity beyond a simple information leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the parameters passed to the `blitFramebuffer` API including source and destination dimensions.
- This can be achieved by crafting a malicious web page that leverages WebGL2 functionalities.
- It can be triggered on systems with specific graphics settings and drivers that don't use MSAA

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page that is rendered by the vulnerable browser.
- The attacker has to be able to influence WebGL parameters of blitFramebuffer API via the malicious page.
- No specific user interaction is needed beyond simply visiting the crafted webpage.
- The vulnerability appears to be more easily triggered in virtualized environments, but that is not necessarily a requirement.
