Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The BestWebSoft's Like & Share WordPress plugin prior to version 2.74 was disclosing the content of password-protected posts to unauthenticated users. This was achieved by including the post content in the `og:description` meta tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The plugin failed to properly restrict access to password-protected content, allowing unauthenticated users to view it.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The content of password-protected posts was exposed via a publicly accessible meta tag (`og:description`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could access the content of posts intended to be protected by a password. This could expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can access the publicly available website and view the page source code.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the website containing the vulnerable plugin.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to view the source code of the page.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the BestWebSoft's Like & Share WordPress plugin that allowed unauthenticated users to read the content of password-protected posts by inspecting the `og:description` meta tag in the page source code.
