Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `delete-user.php` script where the error message from a database query exception (`$e->getMessage()`) is directly echoed back to the user without any sanitization or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, because the malicious script is inserted in the URL parameter and reflected back to the user's browser via an error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `user` parameter of the `/endpoint/delete-user.php` URL. When a victim clicks the crafted link, the script will execute in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Phishing attacks
    - Other malicious actions within the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious payload. This can be done by luring a victim to click the malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `endpoint/delete-user.php`, specifically at line 32.
- The code utilizes `echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();` to display error messages, and this message is not filtered or sanitized, allowing for the injection of script tags.
- The provided payload is: `/endpoint/delete-user.php?user=1'"()%26%25<ScRiPt%20>alert(%27this%20has%20xss%27)</ScRiPt>`
- The example HTTP request demonstrates how this payload is used to trigger the vulnerability.
