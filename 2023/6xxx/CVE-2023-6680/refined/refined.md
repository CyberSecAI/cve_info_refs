Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and protection of the client certificate during the smartcard authentication process. Specifically, the `client_certificate` parameter is passed in plaintext in the redirect from `smartcard.self-hosted.com/extract_certificate` to `self-hosted.com/verify_certificate`. This allows an attacker to intercept and modify this parameter with the public certificate of another user, bypassing authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission of Client Certificate:** The core vulnerability is transmitting the client certificate in plaintext as a URL parameter, making it susceptible to tampering.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Binding:** The server fails to associate the initial authentication request with the subsequent certificate verification request, leading to the possibility of bypassing the original authentication flow.
*   **No Certificate Ownership Proof:** The server does not verify if the user actually possesses the private key that corresponds to the provided public certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Impersonation:** An attacker who obtains a user's public certificate can impersonate that user on the GitLab instance. This allows the attacker to access resources and perform actions as the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly craft a URL with a target user's public certificate to `https://gitlab-instance.example.com/-/smartcard/verify_certificate?client_certificate=[URL-encoded version of certificate]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Public Certificate:** The attacker needs to obtain a user's public certificate through means such as internal directories, OSINT, logs, or phishing.
*   **Network Access to GitLab Instance:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the GitLab instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not present on gitlab.com.
*   The provided output of the GitLab environment confirms the smartcard authentication is enabled.
*   The proposed fix involves encrypting the client certificate when redirecting from `smartcard.self-hosted.com/extract_certificate` to `self-hosted.com/verify_certificate`, thereby preventing manipulation of the parameter.
