- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Information leak in the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `Content-Security-Policy` header exposes configured Devolutions Gateways endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can list configured Devolutions Gateways endpoints.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can obtain the information by inspecting the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or position is needed, the attacker just has to be able to make a request to the server and inspect the response headers.
