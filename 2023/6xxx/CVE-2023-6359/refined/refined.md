The provided content is related to CVE-2023-6359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `localidad` field on the `/users/editmy` page in Alumne LMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a custom JavaScript payload into the `localidad` parameter. If successfully exploited, this could allow an attacker to partially take over another user's browser session. This could include actions performed on behalf of the user or exfiltration of sensitive information within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request to the `/users/editmy` page, where the `localidad` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted request with a malicious javascript payload, and a victim user needs to visit the page with the injected payload, which could be achieved by socially engineering a user. A low privileged user can exploit this.
