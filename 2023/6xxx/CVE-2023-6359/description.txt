A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been found in Alumne LMS affecting version 4.0.0.1.08. An attacker could exploit the 'localidad' parameter to inject a custom JavaScript payload and partially take over another user's browser session, due to the lack of proper sanitisation of the 'localidad' field on the /users/editmy page.
