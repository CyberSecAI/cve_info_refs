Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **lack of proper authorization checks** on multiple AJAX functions within the `/core/core_ajax.php` file of the The Moneytizer WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The plugin fails to verify if the user initiating the AJAX requests has the necessary permissions to perform the actions associated with those requests. Specifically, the plugin relies on nonce verification but lacks the `current_user_can('manage_options')` check in several functions.
*   **Insecure AJAX Handling:** AJAX actions are registered without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data, such as billing and banking details.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify sensitive data, including billing and banking details, and plugin settings.
*   **Loss of Data:** Attackers can reset the plugin's settings, leading to data loss.
*   **Plugin Manipulation:** Attackers can update language settings and perform other less severe actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions in `/core/core_ajax.php`.
*   **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through network requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "subscriber" level access. This means that they do not need administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable functions are located in the `/core/core_ajax.php` file and are registered with `add_action('wp_ajax_*', 'themoneytizer_*')`
*   The vulnerable functions include, but are not limited to:
    *   `themoneytizer_get_bill_details`
    *   `themoneytizer_do_reset_plugin`
    *  `themoneytizer_get_ads_txt`
    *  `themoneytizer_do_reactivate_tag`
    * `themoneytizer_update_profile`
    * `themoneytizer_update_data_auto`
    * `themoneytizer_put_format_on_pending`
    * `themoneytizer_do_generate_tag`
    * `themoneytizer_update_bank_data`
    * `themoneytizer_ads_txt_env_notifier`
    * `themoneytizer_apply_conf`
    * `themoneytizer_update_language`
*   The nonce is verified in these functions but the `current_user_can('manage_options')` check is missing or is not correctly implemented

**Additional Notes**
*  The `themoneytizer_auto_ads_txt` function, which modifies `.htaccess` file is also vulnerable as it only verifies `manage_options` permission in a specific condition (when `internal_action` is null), and is vulnerable if called with parameter.

**Summary**
The Moneytizer plugin <= 9.6.3 is vulnerable to privilege escalation via multiple AJAX endpoints due to missing capability checks. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber access or above to perform unauthorized actions, including modifying sensitive information and plugin settings.
