- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the "data" parameter before using it in an SQL statement. This occurs via an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform SQL Injection attacks. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection, which can be used to extract data from the database or potentially achieve other malicious goals.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through an AJAX action by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=eaz_nestable_docs` parameter and a malicious `data` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber.
