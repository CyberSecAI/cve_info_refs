**Root cause of vulnerability:** The MW WP Form plugin did not properly validate the path of an uploaded file before attempting to delete it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The plugin does not restrict the pathnames when deleting uploaded files, making it possible to delete arbitrary files using path traversal techniques.
- Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability to delete arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Deletion of arbitrary files, including critical files like `wp-config.php`.
- Potential for site takeover and remote code execution due to the deletion of `wp-config.php`

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated network access
- Exploitation via uploaded file paths

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required
- Needs to be able to send crafted requests to the server.
