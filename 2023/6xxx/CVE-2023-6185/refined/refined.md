{
  "CVE-2023-6185": {
    "Root cause": "Improper input validation when handling embedded video filenames passed to GStreamer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient escaping of video filenames",
      "Lack of proper sanitization of inputs passed to GStreamer"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary GStreamer plugin execution. This allows an attacker to run malicious code through installed plugins on the target system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Opening a malformed document with embedded video that contains a specially crafted filename.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a malformed document with a crafted video filename. The attacker also needs knowledge of which GStreamer plugins are available on the target system."
  }
