## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slider Revolution < 6.6.19 - Author+ Insecure Deserialization leading to RCE

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with at least the Author role from unserializing arbitrary content when importing sliders, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.

### Proof of Concept

1. Make sure to configure the plugin so Authors can access its settings
2. Create a new slider.
3. Save and export the slider.
4. Unzip the slider.
5. Create custom\_animations.txt file.
6. Use phpggc WordPress/RCE2 to generate deserialization payload with the following command.
./phpggc WordPress/RCE2 system "touch /var/www/html/pwned.txt"
7. Copy the serialized payload to custom\_animations.txt
8. Zip the slider\_export.txt and custom\_animations.txt.
9. On the site, go to Slider Revolution > Overview.
10. Click on "Manual Import" and upload your zip file. Ignore the import error if any.
11. Visit the site/pwned.txt and notice that the file has been created confirming RCE.
