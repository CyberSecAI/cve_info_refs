- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input during slider import, specifically when handling serialized data, which leads to insecure deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization of arbitrary content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious slider export file containing a crafted serialized payload is imported via the plugin's manual import feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Author-level privileges to access the plugin settings. Additionally, the attacker must craft a malicious payload using phpggc or similar tools and import it through the "Manual Import" feature of the plugin.
