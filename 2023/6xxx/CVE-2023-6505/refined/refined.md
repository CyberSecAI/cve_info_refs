- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to prevent directory listing in sensitive directories where export files are stored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Directory listing vulnerability leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can access and view the contents of export files, which may contain sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:**  Direct access to the vulnerable directory via a web browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/prime-mover-export-files/1/`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required. The attacker only needs knowledge of the vulnerable directory path.
