The content is related to CVE-2023-6620.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape several parameters before using them in SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability. Specifically, in the `ps-delete-email-logs` and `ps-export-email-logs` actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided proof of concept uses `SLEEP(5)` which can be used to confirm the vulnerability is exploitable.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible through the WordPress admin AJAX interface (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`). The vulnerable actions are `ps-delete-email-logs` and `ps-export-email-logs`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker also needs to know the nonce value for the specific page to be able to successfully make the request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
