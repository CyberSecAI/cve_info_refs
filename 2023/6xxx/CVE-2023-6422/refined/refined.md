The provided content is related to CVE-2023-6422.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient encoding of user-controlled input in multiple BigProf products, leading to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent XSS vulnerability in the `FirstRecord` parameter of `/clinic/patients_view.php` in Online Clinic Management System v2.2.
- The affected parameter does not adequately encode user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can store malicious JavaScript payloads on the system.
- When a page containing the injected payload loads, the script will execute.
- This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web browser, by injecting malicious script into the vulnerable `FirstRecord` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `FirstRecord` parameter.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction (victim loading the page) is required to trigger the payload.
