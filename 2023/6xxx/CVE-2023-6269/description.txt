An argument injection vulnerability has been identified in the 
administrative web interface of the Atos Unify OpenScape products "Session Border Controller" (SBC) and "Branch", before version V10 R3.4.0, and OpenScape "BCF" before versions V10R10.12.00 and V10R11.05.02. This allows an 
unauthenticated attacker to gain root access to the appliance via SSH (scope change) and also bypass authentication for the administrative interface and gain
 access as an arbitrary (administrative) user.
