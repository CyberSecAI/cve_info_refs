#### CVE ID

[CVE-2023-6357](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-6357)

#### Last Update:

Aug. 30, 2024, 9:27 a.m.

#### Severity

8.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') [(CWE-78)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)

#### Summary

A low-privileged remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability and inject additional system commands via file system libraries which could give the attacker full control of the device.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-6357)

---

#### Impact

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable industrial controller. Control programs can access local or remote IOs, communication interfaces such as serial ports or sockets, and local system functions such as the file system, the real-time clock and other OS functions.
A successfully authenticated control programmer could exploit this vulnerability to inject calls to additional operating system shell functions via the SysFile or CAA file system libraries.
Only CODESYS Control runtime systems running on Linux or QNX operating systems are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

To exploit this vulnerability, a successful login with according user rights to download a PLC application is required. The online user management therefore protects from exploiting this security vulnerability.

CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends using the online user management. This not only prevents an attacker from downloading virulent code or sending malicious requests, but also suppresses starting, stopping, debugging or other actions on a known working application that could potentially disrupt a machine or system. As of version 3.5.17.0, the online user management is enforced by default.

**Remediation**

Update the following products to version 3.5.19.50:
 • CODESYS Runtime Toolkit

 Update the following products to version 4.11.0.0.
 • CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
 • CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
 • CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
 • CODESYS Control for Linux ARM SL
 • CODESYS Control for Linux SL
 • CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL
 • CODESYS Control for PLCnext SL
 • CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
 • CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL

The products available as CODESYS add-ons can be downloaded and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update in the [CODESYS Update area](https://www.codesys.com/download).
