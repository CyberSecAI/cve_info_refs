Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied meta values when using the `su_meta` shortcode in the "Shortcodes Ultimate" WordPress plugin. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via post meta data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within the `su_meta` shortcode. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the vulnerable shortcode is viewed.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize meta values before storing them in the database.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape meta values when outputting them on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a user's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal session cookies, which could lead to account hijacking.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data from users.
*   **Page Defacement:** The injected scripts could be used to deface the page.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker crafts a post or page containing the `su_meta` shortcode and includes a malicious script within the meta value.
*   **Post Meta Data Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate post meta data to include malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (Contributor+)**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site. This is because contributors can create/edit posts that can contain shortcodes.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage**: The attacker needs to understand how to use the vulnerable `su_meta` shortcode to inject malicious script.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Shortcodes Ultimate plugin up to and including 5.13.3.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 7.0.0 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci
*   The fix involved sanitizing input and output to prevent XSS
*   Version 7.0.0 of the plugin introduces a feature that automatically disables the `[su_meta]` shortcode if a site has users with roles lower than administrator.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability based on the provided sources. It highlights the root cause, weaknesses, impacts, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities, providing a clear picture of the security risk posed by CVE-2023-6225.
