Authentication Bypass Vulnerability and Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability in Multiple FA Engineering Software Products

Release date: January 30, 2024
Last update date: October 31, 2024
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

Overview

Authentication bypass vulnerability due to Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-3061) and remote code execution
vulnerability due to Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-4702) exist in multiple
FA  engineering  software  products. A  remote  unauthenticated  attacker  may  be  able  to  bypass  authentication  by  sending  specially
crafted packets and connect to the products illegally. Furthermore, the attacker may be able to execute a malicious code by remotely
calling a function with a path to a malicious library while connected to the products. As a result, unauthorized users may disclose,
tamper with, destroy or delete information in the products, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the products. (CVE-2023-
6942, CVE-2023-6943)
The product names and versions affected by these vulnerabilities are as follows.

Description

The following two vulnerabilities exist in multiple FA engineering software products:

CVE ID
CVE-2023-6942

CVE-2023-6943

Impact

Description of vulnerabilities
Authentication bypass vulnerability due to Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-
306)
Remote  Code  Execution  Vulnerability  due  to  Use  of  Externally-Controlled  Input  to  Select
Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-470)

A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to bypass authentication by sending specially crafted packets and connect to the
products illegally (CVE-2023-6942). Furthermore, the attacker may be able to execute a malicious code by remotely calling a function
with a path to a malicious library while connected to the products (CVE-2023-6943). As a result, unauthorized users may disclose,
tamper with, destroy or delete information in the products, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the products.

Mitigations / Workarounds

Fixed version
1.110Q or later

Mitsubishi  Electric  recommends that  customers  take  the  following  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  the  risk of  exploiting  these
vulnerabilities:

- When connecting your personal computer with the affected products to the internet, use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN),

etc., to prevent unauthorized access and allow only trusted users to remote login.

- Use your personal computer with the affected products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.
- Restrict physical access to your computer using the affected products as well as to the personal computers and network devices

that can communicate with it.

-  Install  antivirus  software  on  your  personal  computer  using  the  affected  products  and  on  the  personal  computers  that  can

communicate with it.

- Don’t open untrusted files or click untrusted links.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:

* GX Works3: Download [version 1.110Q or later](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/download/index.html)
* When connecting your personal computer with the affected products to the internet, use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc., to prevent unauthorized access and allow only trusted users to remote login.
* Use your personal computer with the affected products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.
* Restrict physical access to your computer using the affected products as well as to the personal computers and network devices that can communicate with it.
* Install antivirus software on your personal computer using the affected products and on the personal computers that can communicate with it.
* Don't open untrusted files or click untrusted links.
