Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `$PROJ_ID_STR` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the code directly incorporates a user-controlled string into the SQL query, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided examples demonstrate that the vulnerability is exploitable through blind SQL injection. This is evident in the payload structure that utilizes `substr(DATABASE(),1,1)` to extract characters from the database name and compare it with a specific ASCII code, causing a delay if the condition is met.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, table names, column names, and data.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to further system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the `general/wiki/cp/ct/delete.php` endpoint. The attacker would manipulate the `$PROJ_ID_STR` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `PROJ_ID_STR` parameter.
    *   The attacker does not necessarily require any prior authentication, assuming the affected endpoint is accessible without it.
    *   The attacker can be in an external network if the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to analyze the server's response time (in the case of blind injection)

*   **Additional details:** The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description, including:
    *   Specific vulnerable versions are identified as below `v11.10` and `v2017`.
    *   A specific vulnerable endpoint is mentioned: `general/wiki/cp/ct/delete.php`
    *   A detailed description of how the injection works due to the improper handling of the `$PROJ_ID_STR` parameter.
    *   Proof of concept (POC) payloads demonstrating blind SQL injection techniques, including extracting the database name one character at a time using time-based attacks.

    *   The content highlights the vulnerability is due to lack of proper input sanitization and parameterization.
