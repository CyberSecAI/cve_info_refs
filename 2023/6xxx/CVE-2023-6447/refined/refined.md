Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The EventPrime plugin versions prior to 3.3.6 lack proper authentication and authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to restrict access to private and password-protected events.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Attackers can access events by guessing their numeric IDs.
*   **Missing Authentication and Authorization:** Unauthenticated users can access sensitive information that should be restricted to authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the content of private and password-protected events without proper authorization.
*   **Bypass of Access Restrictions:** The intended protection mechanisms for events are rendered ineffective.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly access event pages by crafting URLs that contain the event's numeric ID.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone without needing prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges are required:** An attacker only needs to know or guess the event ID.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable URL pattern is `https://www.example.com/index.php/event/{{EVENT-ID}}/`
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.6 of the plugin.
