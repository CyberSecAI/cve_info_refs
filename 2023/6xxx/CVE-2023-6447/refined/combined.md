## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventPrime < 3.3.6 - Unauthenticated Event Access

### Description

The plugin lacks authentication and authorization, allowing unauthenticated visitors to access private and password protected Events by guessing their numeric id/event name.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a password-protected event or a private event then publish it.
2. Access to the URL on a private browser and you will be able to see the password-protected or private event.
3. https://www.example.com/index.php/event/{{EVENT-ID}}/
