- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly verify if the posts being accessed via an AJAX action are actually slides. It also fails to check if the user making the request has the required permissions to view the content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Broken Access Control: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with low privileges (e.g., subscribers) to access content they should not have access to.
    - Arbitrary Post Access: Authenticated users can access any post, including private, draft, and password-protected posts, by manipulating the `imageid` parameter in the AJAX request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view the content of arbitrary posts, including sensitive data in private, draft or password-protected posts, which should only be accessible to users with higher privileges. This unauthorized access could lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Exploitation is done through an AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using the `uris_get_thumbnail` action.
    - The `imageid` parameter can be manipulated to specify the ID of any post on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, even with low-level privileges such as a subscriber role.
    - The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the specified URL endpoint.
