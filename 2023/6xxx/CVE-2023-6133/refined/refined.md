### CVE-2023-6133
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient blacklisting of file types within the `forminator_allowed_mime_types` function. This allows for the upload of files with dangerous extensions that should be restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded file types, failing to prevent the upload of arbitrary file types.
*   **Insufficient Blacklisting:** The `forminator_allowed_mime_types` function does not have a comprehensive list of dangerous file extensions to block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server.
*   **Potential for Code Execution (Mitigated):** While the attacker can upload arbitrary files, the `.htaccess` configuration on the server prevents remote code execution by preventing PHP files from being executed directly.
*   **Data Manipulation/Defacement:** Uploaded files could potentially be used to deface the website or insert malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through the web interface.
*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker uses the file upload form within the Forminator plugin to upload malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or higher.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Dashboard:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin dashboard to upload a file via the Forminator plugin.

**Additional Details:**
*   The Wordfence analysis notes that while arbitrary files can be uploaded, remote code execution is not directly achievable due to the server's .htaccess configuration, which prevents execution of PHP files from the upload directory.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.28.0 of the Forminator plugin. The fix implemented involves enhanced filtering within the `forminator_allowed_mime_types` function.

**Summary of Changeset 2995007**:
*   The changeset introduces additional logic to prevent arbitrary file uploads. It implements a new blacklist of file types directly in the `forminator_allowed_mime_types` function. Previously, mime types were checked against an allowlist, and this change adds a secondary check to deny certain file extensions. This commit also adds code to normalize the upload path.
