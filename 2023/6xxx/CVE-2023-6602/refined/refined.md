Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6602:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from FFmpeg's TTY demuxer not properly handling input format, specifically within HLS playlists. The TTY demuxer is triggered even when the input does not meet the TTY requirements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The TTY demuxer can be invoked even when the input file does not adhere to the typical TTY file extensions (ans, art, asc, diz, ice, nfo, txt, or vt), as long as it is embedded in an HLS playlist with a valid extension like `.m3u8`.
- **HLS File Extension Bypass:** The vulnerability is also connected to how FFmpeg handles HLS playlists, where it bypasses unsafe file extension checks by appending valid extensions (like `.m3u8` or `.mp4`) to base64 encoded data URIs. This allows the TTY demuxer to be triggered with data that would normally be rejected.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Exfiltration:** Because the TTY demuxer renders any input as ASCII text, this vulnerability could lead to the exfiltration of potentially sensitive data embedded within files that are referenced in the HLS playlist via a file:// URI. The file content will be displayed as video output.
- **Incorrect Demuxer Usage:** By forcing the use of the TTY demuxer on non-TTY content, the attacker can control how the data is interpreted and potentially reveal information.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious HLS Playlists:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted HLS playlist files that contain:
    - `data://` URIs with base64 encoded data, followed by a valid file extension to bypass the file extension check (e.g. `data://text/plain;base64,...=.m3u8`).
    - file:// URIs which reference local files the attacker wants to exfiltrate
    - Multiple segments in HLS playlists where at least one segment has an extension that would normally cause the TTY demuxer to be used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input to FFmpeg:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HLS playlist to an instance of FFmpeg.
- **Local File Access (for exfiltration):** To fully exploit data exfiltration potential with file:// URIs, the attacker needs access to the filesystem where the FFmpeg is executed. This enables them to include paths to sensitive files within the crafted playlist.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bug report also mentions several related vulnerabilities in FFmpeg that are triggered by HLS playlist manipulation, including:
    - HLS Unsafe File Extension Bypass (allows for triggering arbitrary demuxers).
    - HLS EXT-X-MAP Null Dereference (causes a segfault).
    - HLS XBIN Demuxer DoS Amplification (leads to large output files and extended transcoding time).
    - DASH Playlist SSRF (allows for arbitrary HTTP GET requests).
- The bug report indicates that upstream commits have been made to address some of the issues, but that these fixes have not been incorporated into any release branches at the time of writing of the report
