```
{
  "CVE-2023-6780": {
    "Description": "An integer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when these functions are called with a very long message, leading to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in undefined behavior. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size within the __vsyslog_internal function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Incorrect buffer size calculation leading to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or other unexpected results.",
    "Attack vectors": "Calling syslog() or vsyslog() with an extremely long message can trigger the integer overflow.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to call `syslog()` or `vsyslog()` with a message length that would cause the integer overflow."
