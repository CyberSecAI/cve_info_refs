- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly protect file download passwords, exposing them when an invalid password is submitted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Incorrect authorization, specifically broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the password for a password-protected file download by submitting an invalid password. This leads to unauthorized access to the protected file.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/wp-json/wpdm/validate-password` endpoint with an invalid password. The password is leaked in the response under the 'op' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the password protected download and send a request to the specified endpoint. No prior authentication is required.
