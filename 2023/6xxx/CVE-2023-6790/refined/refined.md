- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A DOM-Based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DOM-Based XSS, where the JavaScript payload execution is triggered by manipulating the Document Object Model of a web page in the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute a JavaScript payload within the context of an administrator's browser by enticing them to click on a specially crafted link to the PAN-OS web interface. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the web interface, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to craft a malicious link and have a user (administrator) click on it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote, without requiring any special privileges. They must, however, be able to get an administrator to click on their malicious link.
