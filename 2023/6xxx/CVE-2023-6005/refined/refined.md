The provided content details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the EventON and EventON Lite WordPress plugins, and is related to CVE-2023-6005.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically custom metadata fields. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing administrative actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into custom meta field values via the EventON/EventON Lite settings.
- The XSS payload is stored in the database and triggered when editing the affected event again.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site.
- The `unfiltered_html` capability being disallowed will not prevent this exploit.
