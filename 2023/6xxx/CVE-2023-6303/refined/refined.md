- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper filtering of user-supplied input in the "Additional Meta Tag" section within the CSZ CMS administration panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the victim's browser when they visit the website, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By navigating to the admin settings page, specifically  `http://localhost/CSZCMS-V1.3.0/admin/settings/`  and injecting the malicious payload  `<svg><animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s>` into the "Additional Meta Tag" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the CSZ CMS instance to modify the website configurations.
