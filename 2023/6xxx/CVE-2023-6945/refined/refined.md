Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "notmsg" module of the online student management system. The system doesn't filter user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the malicious script is permanently stored in the system's database and is executed whenever a user views the affected content.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing cookies and other sensitive data.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the "notmsg" input field in the "edit-public-notice-detail.php" page. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code via this field.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have valid administrative access to the system. The provided example utilizes default admin credentials (username: mayurik, password: rootadmin).
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the "edit-public-notice-detail.php" page.
    *   No further special capabilities or network position are mentioned, indicating it's a standard web-based attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit uses a simple payload `"<img src="" onerror="alert(111111111)">"`. This payload triggers an alert box, demonstrating the successful execution of the stored script.
*   The content includes the vulnerable page URL, HTTP request details demonstrating the injection, and screenshots confirming the exploit.
*   The vulnerable software is specified as "Online student management system," which is a free download available at the provided sourcecodester link.
*   The report also mentions this is a Stored/Persistent XSS, not Reflected/Non-Persistent XSS.
