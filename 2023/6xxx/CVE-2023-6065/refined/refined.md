Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Quttera Web Malware Scanner WordPress plugin does not restrict access to detailed scan logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Listing:** The plugin exposes sensitive files (specifically `runtime.log` and `quttera_wp_report.txt`) containing detailed scan logs through direct, unrestricted web access.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The exposed log files contain potentially sensitive information, such as local paths and portions of the site's code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain access to internal server paths, potentially revealing the underlying file structure of the WordPress installation.
- Exposure of code snippets may aid in further attacks or reveal vulnerabilities.
- Overall, the sensitive data exposure may reveal important information about the system configuration, potentially increasing the risk of further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct HTTP requests to the exposed log files using their known paths:
  - `http://your_site/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/quttera-web-malware-scanner/runtime.log`
  - `http://your_site/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/quttera-web-malware-scanner/quttera_wp_report.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires no special privileges or authentication.
- The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable plugin's path on the target website.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as **Sensitive Data Disclosure**, aligning with OWASP's A3: Sensitive Data Exposure and CWE-200.
