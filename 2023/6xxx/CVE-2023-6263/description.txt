An issue was discovered by IPVM team in Network Optix NxCloud before 23.1.0.40440. It was possible to add a fake VMS server to NxCloud by using the exact identification of a legitimate VMS server. As result, it was possible to retrieve authorization headers from legitimate users when the legitimate client connects to the fake VMS server.
