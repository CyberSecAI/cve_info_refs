Linux and macOS installers are updated, Qt6 packages replace Qt5 ones, and Flatpak is now built for Wayland (with fallback X11 option).  Sources are compiled with Lazarus 3.6, and are still compatible with Lazarus 2.x line.  A total of 234 file extensions can now be opened as archives by PeaZip.  Translations are available in over than 30 languages, any help is welcome to translate PeaZip to new languages and to maintain current localizations up to date, so please consider taking the time to give a look to [translations repository](https://github.com/giorgiotani/PeaZip-Translations) for newer language files and for any resource useful for translators.  SHA256 hash of packagesHash values of each package are now published in the SHA256.txt file in each release on GitHub. You can check hash values of current release in [SHA256.txt 10.2.0](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/releases/download/10.2.0/SHA256.txt). | | --- |  | [PeaZip 10 change log (current version)](#peazip_bugfix_log)2024 10 26 .. CURRENT   2025 01 01 BACKEND 7z 24.09, with new dictionary size defaults for LZMA/LZMA2 Pea 1.22 introducing hybrid KDF to further increase the resilience of the KDF stage of triple cascaded encryption, requiring multiple unrelated optimizations to mount an hardware accelerated attack on the KDF   CODE Fixes, updated documentation   FILE MANAGER Archives of suitable types (RAR, ZIP, ZIPX) are automatically tested for comment when opened, if archive comment is found, "COMMENT" note is displayed in the status bar  Move the mouse over the "COMMENT" note to display the comment as hint Click the "COMMENT" note to open the comment editing screen Alt+M keyboard shortcut is always available as usual to directly open the comment editing screen for one or multiple archives at once   Improved detection of issues in archives, for archive types browsed with 7z/p7zip frontend If warnings are issued a warning icon is displayed in the address bar for better visibility, alongside the classic textual warning message in the status bar of previous versions If further details are available, they will be visible clicking the warning icon in the address bar or the textual warning message in the status bar   Improved keyboard shortcuts Updated app icon to unify look & feel on all supported platforms Updated Tux theme to improve aspect with dark mode / dark themes   EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING Brotli -q 11 and Zstd --ultra -22 compression levels enabled in the GUI It is now possible to manually delte input files / folders at the end of tasks, from Options tab in the task progress window, i.e. to directly delete a faulty archive failing the test procedure The progress window's icon now matches the format chosen for compression   INSTALLERS (Linux) Qt6 packages supersedes the old Qt5 packages (Linux) GTK3-alpha package is now available for test purpose only (Lazarus support for GTK3 is in alpha state), see Lazarus Widgetset wiki for more information https://wiki.freepascal.org/Widgetset (Linux) Flatpak package is now built for Wayland, with fallback X11 option, and compiled for the Qt6 widgetset (macOS) "macOS service menus" entry in the package is now a link pointing to the folder with same name within the installed peazip.app package, in this way running "xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/peazip.app" applies the correct attributes to the scripts, which can be correctly installed on macOS 15 and following    2024 11 12 10.1.0 BACKEND Pea 1.21, introduced scrypt KDF as default option to improve resilience to password guessing attacks (increasing memory cost per instance) over PBKDF2 implemented in previous versions scrypt is now the default KDF for all cascaded encryption modes, it can be set to use from 64 MB (default) up to 1 GB memory, r set to 8, paralelism 1 to 8 (plus, the KDF is repeated for each of the tree layers of the cascaded encryption)    CODE Fixed "Ask before overwriting (in console)" extraction option, now correctly sets the app in console mode superseding other options Fixed directory copy/move on Unix-like systems (Windows) Fixed drag and drop bug preventing extraction towards some file managers and third party apps, now more file managers are tested for compatibility (Windows) Fixed drag and drop bug failing extraction at first try on some instances   FILE MANAGER GUI update Breadcrumb improvements Highlighting of temporary paths in the breadcrumb bar is now consistent with Theme colors New Theme option to optionally underline and highlight address breadcrumb  Navigation bar improvements Compact side bar mode is now integrated with other navigation bar modes (navigation, treeview, and none, which can be toggled with Alt+4)  It is now possible to internally

hash values of files on Google and Virustotal for detecting known malware, new command line switches to show text preview of files, and to directly save checksum/hash results in GNU Coreutils -compatible formats 7z 24.08   CODE (macOS) New macOS .icns icons to customize the app are now available in (peazip)/res/share/icons folder (macOS) Updated Automator scripts for macOS context menu integration, fixed empty error message after script execution (Windows) Improved Windows native drag and drop implementation (please note current implementation still allows a single drag and drop instance globally) Attempts to launch multiple drag and drop instances, from single or multiple instance of the application, are now effectively stopped without issues for the running drag and drop indtance This limitation can be avoided using internal drag and drop extraction (which is cross-platform) or unchecking "Use native drag and drop" in options to switch to an alternative custom drag and drop implementation  Legacy code cleanup Sorted tab order of UI items Various fixes   FILE MANAGER (Linux) Added MTP devices folder (Media Transfer Protocol) in Filesystem section of navigation sidebar, to make easier to access to mounted devices, i.e. Android phones / tablets (Windows) New System settings items, specific for Windows 10 and more recent systems Settings app, are now featured in app context menu, File manager > System tools for W10+ systems  Expanded File tools section in file browser context menu, archive/extract context menu, and in Test menu in tool bar; it is now possible to Save hash values in GNU Coreutils compatible format Search SHA256 hash values on Google and VirusTotal Display Text preview of file (attempts to parse file as utf8 text, displays linle numbers, text strings and line mumbers can be sorted alphabetically)   Revamped GUI Hints and tooltips can now be turned on/off from Options > Settings, General tab Icons used more sparingly to avoid information repetition and overload Updated progress screen Activity graph moved to the button bar, in order to be visible from all tabs Global progress bar now correctly take in account different
