The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in otcmsV7.01, as reported in a GitHub issue.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `sqlContent` parameter of the `sysCheckFile_deal.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize the `sqlContent` parameter before using it in a database query, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (extracting sensitive information from the database)
  - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
  - Full database compromise
  - Potential access to the underlying operating system, if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/admin/sysCheckFile_deal.php`
- The vulnerable parameter is `sqlContent`, sent within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the otcms application.
- The attacker needs to be logged into the application.
- The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific injection string used in the example is:
  `select+*+from+ot_ad+where+AD_ID=3+and+extractvalue(1,concat(1,(select database())))--+`
- This string attempts to use the `extractvalue()` function in MySQL to extract the database name, demonstrating an error-based SQL injection.
- The request includes a `Cookie` header with a session cookie, implying that the vulnerability is in an authenticated part of the application.
- The `Referer` header indicates the entry point to access the vulnerable page: `http://otcms.com/admin/sysCheckFile.php?mudi=sql`
