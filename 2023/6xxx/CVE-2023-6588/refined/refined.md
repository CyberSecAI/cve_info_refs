Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the offline mode permission is not properly enforced in Devolutions Workspace when using a Devolutions Server data source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The application fails to enforce the configured permissions regarding offline mode. Even if offline access is disallowed, the application still allows it.
*   **Data Leakage:** The lack of proper permission enforcement enables unauthorized access to credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with access to the Devolutions Workspace application can access credentials when offline, regardless of the permission settings, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Devolutions Workspace application.
*   **Offline Scenario:** The attack is possible when the application is used offline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have access to a system where Devolutions Workspace is installed.
*   The attacker does not need network access to the Devolutions Server for this specific exploit.
