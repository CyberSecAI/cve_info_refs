Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "wordpress-users" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings. This means the plugin does not properly verify that the request to change settings is coming from an authorized user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF tokens or checks in the plugin's settings update functionality. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Settings Modification:** An attacker can modify the plugin's settings by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form. This could potentially lead to changes in user display, roles, and other aspects controlled by the plugin. 
- **Limited Impact (per CVSS):**  The CVSS score indicates a medium severity with low impact to integrity.  It does not allow direct access to confidential information or disruption of system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious webpage or link. This page contains the form that exploits the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Web Browser:** The attack is launched through the victim's web browser. When the malicious page is loaded, it automatically submits the crafted settings update request to the WordPress site while the administrator is logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware that the "wordpress-users" plugin is installed and vulnerable (<=1.4).
- **Ability to craft HTML form:** The attacker must create a malicious HTML page with a form that includes the necessary fields to modify the plugin settings.
- **Social engineering to lure the victim:** The attacker must trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to open/submit the crafted HTML page via a link. The victim must have editor permissions or higher.
