An information disclosure vulnerability exists in multiple ManageEngine products that can result in encryption keys being exposed. A low-privileged OS user with access to the host where an affected ManageEngine product is installed can view and use the exposed key to decrypt product database passwords. This allows the user to access the ManageEngine product database.
