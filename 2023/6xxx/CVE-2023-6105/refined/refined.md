Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-6105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Folder Permissions:** The core issue is that multiple ManageEngine products had overly permissive folder access, allowing any logged-in user on the server machine to access the application's installation folder and its files. This lack of proper access control was the root cause.
* **Exposed Encryption Key:** The vulnerable products stored an encryption key (CryptTag) in a configuration file (customer-config.xml) within the installation directory. This key was used to encrypt database passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the encryption key. This is information that should be protected from unauthorized access.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The lack of proper folder permissions is the weakness that allows low-privileged users to access sensitive files.
*   **Weak Encryption Implementation:** While encryption is used, storing the key in a location accessible to low-privileged users undermines the security of the encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** By obtaining the encryption key, a low-privileged user can decrypt the database passwords stored in another configuration file (database_params.conf).
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**  Once the database is accessed, an attacker could:
    *   Execute OS commands with the privileges of the database server's user account, which is typically a high-privilege account (e.g., SYSTEM).
    *   Modify the database to reset administrator passwords for the ManageEngine product.
    *   View sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Breach:** The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database, including domain administrator credentials if stored and decrypted by the application

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the server where the vulnerable ManageEngine product is installed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the configuration files containing the encryption key and encrypted passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege OS User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the operating system where the vulnerable ManageEngine product is installed.
*   **Local Host Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the serverâ€™s file system.
* **Ability to execute python scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to run the provided python script to decrypt the database password

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered **Medium** severity.
*   The vendor (ManageEngine) has released patches for the affected products to address this issue.
*   The Tenable advisory provides a detailed proof-of-concept on how to exploit this vulnerability.
* The advisory mentions that this vulnerability does not impact ManageEngine cloud products

**Affected Products (Comprehensive list):**
The advisory from ManageEngine includes a table with a comprehensive list of all affected products and the corresponding fixed versions. The list includes products such as Access Manager Plus, AD360, ADAudit Plus, ADManager Plus, ADSelfService Plus, Analytics Plus On-Premise, and many more, covering a wide range of ManageEngine's offerings.

**CVE Summary:**
The content provided from multiple sources details the vulnerability, including the root cause, the affected products, the exploitation steps, the impact of a successful exploit, and the fix. A low-privileged user with file-system access on a host running affected ManageEngine products can decrypt database credentials and perform further attacks. This is made possible by an encryption key being accessible via insufficient folder permissions.
