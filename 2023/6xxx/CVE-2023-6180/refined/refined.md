{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `set_ex_data` function in the tokio-boring library did not deallocate memory used by pre-existing data after a TLS connection, leading to a memory leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory After Effective Lifetime",
    "CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Excessive resource consumption leading to potential denial of service (DoS) via resource exhaustion.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks where an attacker can establish new TLS connections with the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish new TLS connections with the vulnerable application. No user interaction or special privileges are required."
