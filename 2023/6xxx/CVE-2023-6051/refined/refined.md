Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The GitLab web interface does not properly verify the integrity of files downloaded from a repository through a specific tag. An attacker can manipulate tags to point to a commit different from what is expected based on the commit history, leading to the download of malicious content despite the web interface showing seemingly benign commit information. Specifically, an attacker can create a tag that has the same name as the commit hash but points to an older commit with malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Tag Manipulation:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to create tags with names that appear to be valid commit hashes but point to arbitrary commits. This circumvents the expectation that a tag reflects a specific state of the repository.
*   **Lack of Integrity Verification:** The GitLab web interface relies on the tag name and not the actual content of the commit when presenting information. It fails to verify that the tag actually points to the expected commit and its corresponding content, instead relying on visual inspection of the commit history through the web UI.
*   **Web Interface Trust:** The web interface displays information about commits and files, leading users to believe that the downloaded content matches that information. This trust is misplaced because the attacker can manipulate the tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into files that are downloaded by users. This code can be anything the attacker chooses, allowing for various types of attacks.
*   **Unauthorized Code Execution:** Once downloaded and executed, the malicious code could compromise the user's system, leading to actions like unauthorized data access, system control, or further malware propagation.
*   **Compromised Supply Chain:** If this vulnerability is exploited in a widely used project, it could lead to the compromise of many downstream users who unknowingly download compromised code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Tag Creation:** An attacker with developer access can create a branch, modify a file, create a tag with the name of a commit hash that points to a commit with malicious code, push this malicious tag, and then remove the malicious branch from the server.
*   **Web Interface Download:** The victim downloads the source code from the GitLab web interface through a release or tag. The downloaded files contain the malicious code instead of the expected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Developer Permissions:** The attacker needs developer permissions on the repository to push tags, branches, and commits. This makes the attack a potential insider threat or a risk from a compromised developer account.
*   **Git knowledge:** The attacker needs sufficient Git knowledge to manipulate commits, branches, and tags as described in the steps to reproduce.

**Additional Details (From Report):**

*   The vulnerability has the same impact as previous reports #1760033 and #2053335.
*   The steps to reproduce involve creating a malicious tag that has the same name as a legitimate commit hash but points to an older commit containing malicious code. This crafted tag is then used when a user downloads files from the web interface, which leads to the user obtaining the malicious content instead of the correct and expected content.
*   A video is provided as a proof-of-concept showing a user downloading files through a tag, and then a malicious code execution happens.
*   A public repository was provided as a proof-of-concept: <https://gitlab.com/user_V/poc-0001>
