### Root cause of vulnerability
The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling the featured image alt text.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization.
- Inadequate output escaping.

### Impact of exploitation
An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, it will execute, potentially leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Malicious redirects
- Defacement of website

### Attack vectors
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the 'featured image alt text' field.
- The injected script is stored in the database.
- When a user views a page or post that displays the affected alt text, the script is executed in their browser.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- Authenticated access to the WordPress dashboard with at least contributor-level privileges.
- Ability to edit posts or categories where the featured image alt text is used.
