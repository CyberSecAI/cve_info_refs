- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An improper privilege management vulnerability in PAN-OS allows a read-only administrator to revoke active XML API keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management (CWE-269) allows a read-only administrator to perform actions that should be restricted to higher privilege users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A read-only administrator can revoke active XML API keys, disrupting XML API usage. This results in a denial of service by preventing API access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have authenticated read-only administrator access to the PAN-OS XML API.
