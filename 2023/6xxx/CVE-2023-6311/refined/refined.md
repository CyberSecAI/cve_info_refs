The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Loan Management System, specifically within the `delete_ltype.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `ltype_id` parameter, before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, as demonstrated by the payload used to retrieve the database name.
- Data Manipulation:  Attackers could potentially modify or delete data.
- Full database compromise:  It is possible to use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerable parameter `ltype_id` is passed via a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
-  The attacker does not require specific privileges within the application itself to exploit the vulnerability. The default credentials can be used to log in.
