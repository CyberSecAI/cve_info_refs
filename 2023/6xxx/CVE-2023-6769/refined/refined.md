- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user inputs in the "question" and "item" parameters within the "lp_admin.php" file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can store a malicious JavaScript payload in the application. This could lead to malicious JavaScript execution when a user loads the page, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload via the "question" and "item" parameters of the "lp_admin.php" file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable application and provide the malicious payload through the mentioned parameters. No authentication is explicitly required to inject the payload, according to the document.
