The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA, specifically in the `delete.php` file within the `general/vote/manage/` route.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `$DELETE_STR` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The code directly incorporates a user-supplied parameter into the SQL statement, leading to potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to:
    - Extract sensitive information, such as database names, table structures, and data.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the system.
    - In this case, the attacker was able to identify the database name through blind SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `delete.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `$DELETE_STR` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `delete.php` endpoint. The specific authorization requirements are not specified in the document, however, it is likely that some form of authorization is required to access the endpoint in the first place. They must be able to craft SQL injection payloads that exploit the lack of input sanitization to the `$DELETE_STR` parameter.

The content also provides proof-of-concept (POC) payloads demonstrating how to perform blind SQL injection to extract the database name. These POCs use time-based techniques to deduce characters of the database name.
