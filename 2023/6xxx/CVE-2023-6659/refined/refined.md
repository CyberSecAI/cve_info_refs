The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Web-based Student Clearance System, an open-source project from campcodes.com.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `login.php` file, where user-supplied input (`student`) is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Leakage:** Successful exploitation can lead to the leakage of sensitive database information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `login.php`.
*   **Malicious Input:** The `student` parameter is injected with a crafted SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  The attacker needs to know that the `student` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** `/libsystem/login.php`
*   **Specific Payload:** The provided payload uses `SLEEP(5)` to confirm the injection point.
*   **Target Software:** Online College Library System using PHP/MySQLi Source Code from campcodes.com.
*   **PHP Version:** PHP/8.1.10.
