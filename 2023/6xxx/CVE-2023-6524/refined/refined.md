Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6524

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the map title parameter within the MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize the "Location Name and Description" fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable plugin.
*   These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
*   Potential impacts include session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker must be authenticated with Contributor access or higher.
*   The attacker injects a malicious payload into the map title parameter (location name/description) via the plugin's interface.
*   The injected payload is stored in the database.
*   When a user views a page that displays the map, the payload executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   Needs access to the WordPress admin dashboard where the MapPress plugin settings are located.
*   No special network access is required as the attack is web-based.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin versions up to and including 2.88.13.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 2.88.14.
*   The proof of concept demonstrates how to inject a simple `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>` payload, indicating the possibility of more complex attacks.
