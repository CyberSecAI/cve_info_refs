{
  "CVE-2023-6377": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient memory allocation during logical device switches when calculating XKB button actions, which leads to out-of-bounds memory reads and writes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds memory reads and writes due to insufficient memory allocation when handling XKB button actions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can result in local privilege escalation (if the server runs as root) or remote code execution (e.g., x11 over ssh).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by forcing a logical device change on a device with buttons, such as moving from a touchpad to a mouse.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system, or remote access with X11 forwarding."
  },
  "CVE-2023-6478": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is an integer overflow in the length calculation for `RRChangeProviderProperty` or `RRChangeOutputProperty` requests due to a 32-bit integer clipping, allowing an attacker to bypass the `REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE` check.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds memory read and information disclosure.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information and memory corruption.",
