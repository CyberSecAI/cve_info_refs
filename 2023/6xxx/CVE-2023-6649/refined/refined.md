{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before embedding it into the HTML output, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Lack of output encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, and other unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL containing a malicious script within the 'searchdata' parameter of the application's index.php endpoint. When the server reflects this unsanitized input back to the user, the browser executes the script.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication. The attacker can craft the malicious URL and trick the victim into clicking it, or embed it in a website/email. "
