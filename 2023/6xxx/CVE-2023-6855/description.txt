The Paid Memberships Pro â€“ Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of membership levels created by the plugin due to an incorrectly implemented capability check in the pmpro_rest_api_get_permissions_check function in all versions up to 2.12.5 (inclusive). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change membership levels including prices.
