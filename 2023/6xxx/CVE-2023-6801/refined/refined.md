**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the RSS Aggregator by Feedzy plugin's admin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker with author-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute when a user accesses an injected page. This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions on behalf of other users, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data theft, or website defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin's admin settings, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least author-level permissions to access and modify the plugin settings where the malicious scripts are injected.
