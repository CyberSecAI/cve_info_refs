**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insufficient encoding of user-controlled input within various BigProf products. This lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically persistent XSS. The vulnerability exists in multiple files and parameters across different BigProf products.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to store dangerous JavaScript payloads on the system.
- When a user visits a page containing the malicious script, the script executes, potentially leading to:
   - Stealing session cookies
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites
   - Defacing the web page
   - Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specific parameters in vulnerable files within BigProf products. In the case of CVE-2023-6426, it's the `FirstRecord` parameter of `/invoicing/app/invoices_view.php`.
- The attacker injects malicious javascript code into the vulnerable parameter
- When the page is loaded, the javascript code is executed in the user's browser

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious payload through the vulnerable parameter.
- No specific authentication or privileges are mentioned to perform the attack.
- The content of the page where the malicious code has been injected needs to be visited by another user for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
