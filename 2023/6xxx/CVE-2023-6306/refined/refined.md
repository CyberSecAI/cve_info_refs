Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `/ample/app/ajax/member_data.php` file of the "Free and Open Source inventory management system".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the input to the `/ample/app/ajax/member_data.php` file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Access sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/ample/app/ajax/member_data.php` file.
- An attacker would need to send crafted requests containing malicious SQL code within the input parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to identify the specific input parameters that are used in the vulnerable SQL query within the `member_data.php` file.
