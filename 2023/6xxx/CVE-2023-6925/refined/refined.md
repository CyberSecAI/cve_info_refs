- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient file type validation in the `importZipFile` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to lack of proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution may be possible due to the ability to upload arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated users with Editor or higher roles can upload malicious files through the `importZipFile` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Editor or higher privileges on the WordPress site. The administrator must have previously granted access to the plugin for this user role.
