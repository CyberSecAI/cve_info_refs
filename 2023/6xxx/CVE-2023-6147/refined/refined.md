Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6147:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Qualys Policy Compliance Scanning Connector Plugin for Jenkins does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE vulnerability:** The plugin's failure to configure its XML parser allows for the injection of external entities, leading to XXE vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Secret extraction:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can use crafted XML data with external entities to perform server-side request forgery, potentially accessing internal resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Configuration of jobs:** Attackers with the ability to configure jobs within Jenkins can inject malicious XML payloads that exploit the XXE vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to have the permission to configure jobs within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.
