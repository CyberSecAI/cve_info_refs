{
  "CVE-2023-6720": {
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper sanitization of field elements allows storage of a malicious JavaScript payload on the server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
       "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can trigger the malicious payload when the application loads, potentially leading to the compromise of user interactions with the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker injects a specially crafted JavaScript payload into a field element.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the Repox application to store the malicious payload. The attacker also requires a user to load a page where the XSS payload is executed."
