- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `empid` parameter within the `add-phlebotomist.php` endpoint before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unauthorized access to databases, data theft, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `add-phlebotomist.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `empid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `empid` parameter. The attacker must also have access to the application and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.
