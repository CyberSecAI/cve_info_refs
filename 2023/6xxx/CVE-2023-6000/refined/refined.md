Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6000

**Vulnerable Software:** Popup Builder WordPress plugin versions prior to 4.2.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of POST parameters within the plugin. Some parts of the code directly access `$_POST` values, while others use the plugin's `SGPopup::parsePopupDataFromData()` method. This inconsistency, combined with a sensitive post-previewing function hooked on the `init` action without capability checks, allows for exploitation. The `parsePopupDataFromData` sanitizes some fields but does not sanitize all of them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into popup content via a POST request, which is then stored in the database. This injected script will execute when a user views the affected page or popup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this XSS vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the targeted website.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially perform actions on the site with the privileges of any logged-in administrator who views the crafted content, including installing malicious plugins and creating new admin accounts, leading to a full compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable website.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Unsanitized input:** The plugin fails to sanitize user controlled inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- **No Account Needed:** The attacker does not need an account on the target WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of a Popup ID:**  The attacker needs to know the ID of an existing popup.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code snippet of the `parsePopupDataFromData` function shows that the plugin sanitizes some values using `sanitize_text_field()` and `wp_sanitize_redirect()`. However, the vulnerability exists because other fields are not sanitized before being stored and displayed. The proof of concept demonstrates the injection of javascript code by sending the `sgpb-ShouldOpen` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- A proof of concept (PoC) curl command is provided in the content demonstrating the attack, which allows for injecting Javascript into a popup.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.2.3 of the Popup Builder plugin.
- The CVSS score is 8.8 which is rated as high severity.
