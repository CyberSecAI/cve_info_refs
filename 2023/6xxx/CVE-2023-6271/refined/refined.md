{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Backup Migration plugin stores in-progress backups information, including database table dumps, in publicly accessible files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive Data Exposure",
       "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information",
       "Lack of Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including database contents, configurations, and potentially user credentials. This can lead to brute-force attacks on password hashes and complete system compromise, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing publicly available files within the plugin's directory.",
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication is required. The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable directory path and initiate a backup in order to access in-progress backups."
