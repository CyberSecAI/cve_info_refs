## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory ***wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables***. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system.

## **Understanding of Sensitive Data Exposure attack’s**

**Sensitive data exposure** refers to the unintended revelation of confidential information, making it accessible to unauthorized entities. In WordPress, this could involve exposing critical configuration details, directory structures, and files. Real-world examples demonstrate that attackers can leverage such exposure to gain insights into the site’s infrastructure, potentially leading to **unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data**.

## **Exploiting the **Sensitive Data Exposure** Vulnerability**

Exploiting the **Backup Migration vulnerability** involves utilizing the exposed directory to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers may target specific files, particularly those containing password hashes, and leverage this information **to launch brute force attacks**. By compromising password hashes, attackers can potentially **gain control of user accounts, allowing for unauthorized access and manipulation of the entire system**.

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory ***wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables***. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system.

## **Understanding of Sensitive Data Exposure attack’s**

**Sensitive data exposure** refers to the unintended revelation of confidential information, making it accessible to unauthorized entities. In WordPress, this could involve exposing critical configuration details, directory structures, and files. Real-world examples demonstrate that attackers can leverage such exposure to gain insights into the site’s infrastructure, potentially leading to **unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data**.

## **Exploiting the **Sensitive Data Exposure** Vulnerability**

Exploiting the **Backup Migration vulnerability** involves utilizing the exposed directory to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers may target specific files, particularly those containing password hashes, and leverage this information **to launch brute force attacks**. By compromising password hashes, attackers can potentially **gain control of user accounts, allowing for unauthorized access and manipulation of the entire system**.

# CVE-2023-6271 – Backup Migration – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Full Control of the site – POC/Exploit

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-6271 – Backup Migration – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Full Control of the site – POC/Exploit

A **critical vulnerability** has been identified in the **Backup Migration plugin** within the directory **wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables**. This flaw not only discloses comprehensive information about the site, ***including its configuration, directories, and files, but, more critically, grants unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, posing a significant security risk.*** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to imminent threats, including potential brute force attacks on password hashes and the subsequent compromise of the entire system.

| December 10, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-6271** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory ***wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables***. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system.

## **Understanding of Sensitive Data Exposure attack’s**

**Sensitive data exposure** refers to the unintended revelation of confidential information, making it accessible to unauthorized entities. In WordPress, this could involve exposing critical configuration details, directory structures, and files. Real-world examples demonstrate that attackers can leverage such exposure to gain insights into the site’s infrastructure, potentially leading to **unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data**.

## **Exploiting the **Sensitive Data Exposure** Vulnerability**

Exploiting the **Backup Migration vulnerability** involves utilizing the exposed directory to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers may target specific files, particularly those containing password hashes, and leverage this information **to launch brute force attacks**. By compromising password hashes, attackers can potentially **gain control of user accounts, allowing for unauthorized access and manipulation of the entire system**.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Backup Migration Staging < 1.3.6 - Sensitive Data Exposure

### Description

The plugin stores in-progress backups information in easy to find, publicly-accessible files, which may allow attackers monitoring those to leak sensitive information from the site's backups.

### Proof of Concept

1) Run a backup of the site
2) Notice the following files are all publicly available while the site is being backed up:
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_links.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_users.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_termmeta.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/bmi\_logs\_this\_backup.log
(... the list is not exhaustive, virtually every table accessible to the site gets dumped in those log files ...)

# CVE-2023-6271 – Backup Migration – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Full Control of the site – POC/Exploit

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-6271 – Backup Migration – Unauth Sensitive Data Exposure to Full Control of the site – POC/Exploit

A **critical vulnerability** has been identified in the **Backup Migration plugin** within the directory **wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables**. This flaw not only discloses comprehensive information about the site, ***including its configuration, directories, and files, but, more critically, grants unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, posing a significant security risk.*** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to imminent threats, including potential brute force attacks on password hashes and the subsequent compromise of the entire system.

## **Main info:**

## **Timeline**

| November 15, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Backup Migration** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| November 15, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| December 1, 2023 | The author fixed the vulnerability and released the plugin update |
| December 10, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-6271** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

A severe vulnerability has been discovered in the directory ***wordpress/wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables***. This flaw not only exposes extensive information about the site, including its configuration, directories, and files, but more critically, it provides unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database and all data inside. Exploiting this vulnerability poses an imminent threat, leading to potential brute force attacks on password hashes and, subsequently, the compromise of the entire system.

## **Understanding of Sensitive Data Exposure attack’s**

**Sensitive data exposure** refers to the unintended revelation of confidential information, making it accessible to unauthorized entities. In WordPress, this could involve exposing critical configuration details, directory structures, and files. Real-world examples demonstrate that attackers can leverage such exposure to gain insights into the site’s infrastructure, potentially leading to **unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data**.

## **Exploiting the **Sensitive Data Exposure** Vulnerability**

Exploiting the **Backup Migration vulnerability** involves utilizing the exposed directory to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers may target specific files, particularly those containing password hashes, and leverage this information **to launch brute force attacks**. By compromising password hashes, attackers can potentially **gain control of user accounts, allowing for unauthorized access and manipulation of the entire system**.

> **POC**:

In ***real-world scenarios***, attackers could exploit the exposed directory to conduct reconnaissance on the site’s structure, locate crucial files, and access sensitive data within the database. This could lead to ***unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other malicious activities***, ultimately compromising the integrity and security of the entire system.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

* To mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability, the following recommendations are advised:
* **Directory Security Measures:** Implement robust security measures for directories, including access controls and regular audits to detect and address vulnerabilities promptly.
* **Database Encryption:** Employ encryption for sensitive data stored in the database to safeguard it even if unauthorized access occurs.
* **Plugin Update:** Ensure that the Backup Migration plugin is regularly updated with the latest security patches to address this vulnerability.
* **Password Policy:** Enforce strong password policies to minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks.

> By implementing these security measures, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure associated with the **Backup Migration** vulnerability.

# Backup Migration

By [Inisev](https://inisev.com)

[Download](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/backup-backup.1.4.7.zip)

* [Details](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup-backup/#description)
* [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup-backup/#reviews)

* [Development](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backup-backup/#developers)

[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/backup-backup/)

## Description

**Try it out on your free dummy site: Click here => [https://tastewp.com/plugins/backup-backup](https://demo.tastewp.com/bmi).**

(this trick works for all plugins in the WP repo – just replace “wordpress” with “tastewp” in the URL)

Creating a backup of your site has never been easier!

Simply install the plugin, click on “Create backup now” – done.

You can also schedule backups, e.g. define that a backup should be taken automatically every week (or every day/month).

Use a wide choice of configuration options:

* Define exactly which files / databases should be in the backup, and which not
* Define where the backup will be stored (as of now, only a local option is available, but we’ll expand this soon)
* Define what name your backup should have, in which instances you should receive a notification email, and much more

This plugin is all in one solution if you need to migrate your site to another host or just restore the local backup.

Note: This (free) version is limited to backups of 2GB in size. For unlimited sizes, please have a look at the [Premium Plugin](https://backupbliss.com). The code of this free plugin is licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), however, we claim rights to other content.

## FAQ

### How do I create my first backup?

Click on “Create backup now” on the settings page of the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin.

BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging will by default create a backup that contains everything from your site, except the BackupBliss plugin’s own backups and WordPress installation – if you want to include the WordPress installation as well, tick the checkbox in the section “What will be backed up?”.

You can download backup or migrate your backup (use the plugin as a WordPress duplicator) immediately after the backup has been created.

### How do I restore a backup?

* If your backup is **located on your site**: Go to the BackupBliss Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have your backups list, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* If your backup is **located on another site**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #1, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have the backups list, click on the “Copy Link”-button in the “Actions”-column. Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #2, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, click on “Super-quick migration”, paste the copied link, and hit the “Restore now!” button. This process will first import the backup and then restore it, i.e. Backup Migrate also serves as backup importer.
* If your backup is *located on another device*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, and click on the “Upload backup files” button. After the upload, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* If your backup is *located on Google Drive*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, turn ON the Google Drive option, and connect to your account. After that, the plugin will sync the available backup files in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups” from where you will be able to run Restore.

### How do I migrate or clone my site?

Migrate (or clone) a WordPress site by creating a full backup on the site that you want to migrate (clone) – site #1.

* To transfer website **directly from site #1 to site #2**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #1, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have the backups list, click on the Copy Link button in the Actions column. Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #2, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, click on “Super-quick migration”, paste the copied link, and hit the “Restore now!” button. Make sure that the backup file on site #1 is accessible by setting “Accessible via direct link?” to “Yes” in the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”
* To migrate the website **indirectly**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, and click on the “Upload backup files” button. After the upload, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* To migrate the website with *Google Drive*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, turn ON the Google Drive option, and connect to your account. After that, the plugin will sync the available backup files in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups” from where you will be able to run Restore.

### Where can I find my backups?

BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging allows you to download backups, migrate backups, or delete backups directly from the plugin screen Manage & Restore Backup(s). By default, the migrator plugin will store a backup to /wordpress/wp-content/backup-migration but you can change the backup location to anywhere you please.

### How to run automatic backups?

Enabling automatic backups is done on the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin’s home screen, just next to the “Create backup now!” button. Auto backup can run on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. You can set the exact time (and day) and how many automatic backups would you like to keep in the same BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin section. We recommend that you optimize the number of backups that will be kept according to available space.

### How big are backup files?

Backup file size depends on the criteria you select in the “What will be backed up?” section of the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin. There you can see file/folder size calculations as you Save your settings. Usually, WordPress’ Uploads folder is the heaviest, while Databases are the lightest. If you are looking to save up space, you might want to deselect Plugins and WordPress installation folders, as you can usually download those anytime from WP sources.

### Is the backup creation and site migration free?

Yes. You can create full site backups, and automatic backups, and migrate your site (duplicate site) free of charge. [BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging Pro](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2) provides more sophisticated filters and selections of files that will be included/excluded from backups (affecting backup size), faster backup creation times, number of external backup storage locations, backup encryption, backup file compression methods, advanced backup triggers, additional backup notifications by email, priority support, and more.

### ⭐️ NEW! How to create staging sites?

You can easily set up a staging environment for your website with the BackupBliss plugin. You can choose to create a staging site either on your server / machine or on [TasteWP](https://tastewp.com/). Both options are free!

1. To create a staging site on your server, navigate to the plugin section “Create a staging site”, select “Your server & domain”, define a custom path if you wish, and click on the button “Create staging site!”.
2. To create a stage site on a free WordPress sandbox platform – [TasteWP](https://tastewp.com/), select the option “TasteWP (external server)”, then select a backup file that will be used, and click on the button “Create staging site!”.

### Is cloud backup available?

Backup to Google Drive is now available in the [BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging Pro](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2)

Upcoming storage options will include: FTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace, DreamObjects, OpenStack, Google Cloud, SFTP/SCP, Microsoft Azure, OneDrive, Backblaze, and more.

### ⭐️ NEW! How do I back up to Google Drive?

In order to automatically upload your site backups to Google Drive, you will need a [Pro version](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2) of the plugin. Once installed and activated, navigate to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, and turn ON the Google Drive feature. Click on the button Connect, and select a Google account you want to connect to. Once it is connected, your backup files from the website will start to sync to your Google Drive. You can monitor the process in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups”

### How are you better than other backup/migration plugins?

Besides having the most intuitive interface and smoothest user experience, BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin will always strive to give you more than any competitor:

– Updraftplus: They charge for migration, with our plugin it’s free;

– All-in-One WP Migration: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they don’t have selective/partial backups; they lack advanced options and each external storage is on a separate extension plugin; they have no automatic backups;

– Duplicator: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they have no selective backups, exclusion rules, no automatic backups and no migration;

– WPvivid: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they don’t have selective/partial backups, exclusion rules, or automatic backups;

– BackWPup: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they lack restore options, backups are slower, automatic backups are dependant on wp cron;

– Backup Guard: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they have no selective backups, exclusion rules; no direct migration;

– XCloner: Automatic backups are dependant on wp cron; full restore not available on a local server;

– Total Upkeep: They lack the advanced selective backups and exclusion rules, lacks a monthly backup schedule

### How to upload my backup file?

Uploading a backup can be simply done by navigating to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) section of the BM plugin (tab on the right side). There you have the “Upload backup file” button, after clicking on it, you need to select a proper backup that is made by this plugin only. You cannot use backups from other plugins (to restore those, go back to those plugins and restore them this way). If you use “Super-quick migration” (section b), your backup will be automatically uploaded. If you are having trouble uploading the backup file, go bac and ensure that the folder designated for backups is writable. You can find the backup destination in the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?

I’m sorry but the plugin doesn’t work, a larger backup will collapse. Migration doesn’t work. Deleted.

# Backup Migration Staging < 1.3.6 - Sensitive Data Exposure

### Description

The plugin stores in-progress backups information in easy to find, publicly-accessible files, which may allow attackers monitoring those to leak sensitive information from the site's backups.

### Proof of Concept

1) Run a backup of the site
2) Notice the following files are all publicly available while the site is being backed up:
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_links.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_users.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/db\_tables/wp\_termmeta.sql
./wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/htaccess/bmi\_logs\_this\_backup.log
(... the list is not exhaustive, virtually every table accessible to the site gets dumped in those log files ...)

### Affects Plugins

Another option in Security Traffic Control – “Block user after requests amounts more than” – blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.

#### Security Firewall

To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.

Also, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.

#### Security Malware Scanner

Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.

CleanTalk Security has a “Feedback System” for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.

Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.

Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.

Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.

[About Scanner Feedback System](https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis "About Scanner Feedback System")

#### Security Malware Heuristic Check

This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

#### Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections

The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.

#### Scanner of known vulnerabilities

Plugin checks installed plugins and themes for known (published) vulnerabilities. If finds vulnerable plugin/theme, it sends an Email notification and shows data in the WordPress Dashboard.

#### Web Application FireWall (WAF) for WordPress Security Plugin

The main purpose of Web Application FireWall (WAF) is real-time protection from unauthorized access, even if there are critical known/unknown vulnerabilities.

Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.

In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs\_firewall

CleanTalk’s research team updates WAF database each time as we find a vulnerability, it means plugin’s users get protection even against unpublished vulnurebilites.

#### Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication

It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.

With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.

#### Change the URL of the wp-login page

This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.

To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -> Settings -> Security by CleanTalk -> General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.

This option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.

If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.

#### Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together

Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.

#### Email Notifications when administrators are logged in

We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.

Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.

You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.

#### Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?

Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.

#### `Send additional HTTP headers` option

There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:

– “X-Content-Type-Options” improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.

– “X-XSS-Protection” header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.

– “Strict-Transport-Security” response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.

– “Referrer-Policy” make the `Referer` http-header transferring more strictly.

#### File System Watcher feature

File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.

#### CleanTalk Research

On your Malware Security Log page, you will see the list of all scans that were performed for your website. The CleanTalk Cloud saves the list of the found files for you to know where to look them for.

### How to start malware scanner?

At the moment malware scanner may be started one time per day and manually.

To start malware scanner go to the WordPress Admin Page —> Settings —> Security by CleanTalk —> “Malware Scanner” tab —> Perform Scan.

### What happens after the end of the trial period?

The plugin will fully perform its functions after the end of the trial period and will protect your website from brute force attacks and will keep Action Log in your WP Dashboard, but the number of entries in the log will be limited to the last 20 entries/24 hours. Also, you will receive a short daily security report to your email.

Premium version allows to storage all logs for 45 days in the CleanTalk Dashboard for further analysis.

### Brute Force security for WordPress

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.

### Why is the CleanTalk Security Plugin Added to the Must Use Section?

This is required for the Security FireWall to function properly. Plugins that are placed in this section are being launched first, so it is very important that the Security FireWall is launched before any plugins and hooks. Thus, hacker requests will be stopped before they can get access to any site code.
