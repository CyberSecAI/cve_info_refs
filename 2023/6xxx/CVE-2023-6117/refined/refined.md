Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Obsolete functionalities in the REST API methods of the M-Files server allow for excessive server memory consumption. Specifically, the file upload/sharing method to the Drive is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400 or CWE-770): The API does not properly limit the amount of resources (memory) that can be consumed during file upload operations.
- Excessive Allocation (CAPEC-130): The vulnerability stems from excessive memory allocation, particularly when large files are uploaded asynchronously.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the M-Files server to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial of service. This means the server may become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network (AV:N): The attack is performed remotely over a network.
- Low Attack Complexity (AC:L): The attack is relatively easy to perform.
- Requires User Interaction (UI:R): While the attacker needs a user to initiate the upload, this part of the attack is not complex.
- Requires Low Privileges (PR:L): A user with low privileges can perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to access the M-Files server over the network.
- Valid User Credentials: The attacker needs to have valid credentials for an M-Files user with access to the vulnerable API method (upload/sharing).
- Ability to initiate a file upload request: The attacker needs to initiate an upload of a large file, preferably asynchronously.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was internally found.
- The probability of exploitation is considered low.
- The vulnerability is present in M-Files Server versions before 23.11.13156.0.
- The CVSS score is 5.7 (base) and 4.9 (temporal).
- The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:R, indicating a high impact on availability.
