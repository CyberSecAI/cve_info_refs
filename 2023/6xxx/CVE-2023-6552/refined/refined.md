Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an **open redirect** in the TasmoAdmin application. Specifically, it stems from the lack of proper validation of the `current` GET parameter when changing the language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (CWE-601):** The application does not validate or sanitize the "current" parameter, allowing an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL for redirection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing an attacker-controlled URL in the `current` parameter. When a user clicks on this link, they will be redirected to the attacker's chosen website.
-   **Phishing:** This can be used for phishing attacks, where a user is redirected to a fake login page or other malicious content disguised as the legitimate application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL with the vulnerable `current` parameter containing a malicious destination.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the crafted URL, usually through social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs with arbitrary values in the `current` parameter.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to persuade a victim to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**

-   The vulnerability is present in all versions of TasmoAdmin prior to version 3.3.0.
-   The vulnerability was discovered by CERT Polska through their own research.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.0.
