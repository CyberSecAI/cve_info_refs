  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `su_meta` shortcode not properly validating user-supplied 'key' and 'post_id' parameters. This allows attackers to access arbitrary post meta values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
      "Missing Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can retrieve sensitive information from post meta values when combined with other plugins.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious `su_meta` shortcode with controlled 'key' and 'post_id' parameters."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access on the WordPress site."

    "Wordfence_references": [
      "The Wordfence Intelligence description of the vulnerability is more detailed than the CVE description, providing specifics about the vulnerable shortcode (`su_meta`) and affected parameters ('key', 'post_id'). It also clarifies the user access level needed to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "The Wordfence description specifies the vulnerable plugin version (<= 5.13.3) and the patched version (7.0.0).",
       "Wordfence also indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci."

      "The provided changeset ([3000576](/changeset/3000576/shortcodes-ultimate)) shows the extensive code changes made in version 7.0.0, which includes security fixes.",
    "The change log in the readme.txt file confirms that a security fix is included in version 7.0.0 and includes a note about potential deactivation of the `[su_meta]` shortcode if there are users below administrator level.",
      "The diff for `includes/shortcodes/meta.php` shows that in version 7.0.0, input sanitization and checks are added to prevent unauthorized access to arbitrary post meta data, the shortcode is now disabled by default if a user below admin level exists, also a new filter `su/shortcode/meta/allowed_keys` is added for further security enhancement. The diff for `includes/shortcodes/button.php` shows the addition of `trim( strtolower( $atts['style'] ) );` for sanitizing the value of style argument."
