```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not prevent directory listing of the `backups-dup-lite/tmp` (or `backups-dup-pro/tmp` in the Pro version) directory, which stores sensitive data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive data exposure due to the lack of directory listing protection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive files, including full database dumps and site zip archives, if the web server has directory listing enabled. This can lead to full site compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by accessing the `/wp-content/backups-dup-lite/tmp/` or `/wp-content/backups-dup-pro/tmp/` directories via a web browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no authentication and must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, which must have directory listing enabled."
