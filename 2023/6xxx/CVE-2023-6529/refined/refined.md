- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF checks in a function hooked to `admin_init`. This allows unauthenticated users to downgrade the plugin to a vulnerable version.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Broken Access Control:** Unauthenticated users can trigger the plugin downgrade.
    - **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection allows unauthenticated users to exploit the downgrade functionality.
    - **XSS:** Downgrading to older plugin versions introduces reflected or stored XSS vulnerabilities that were present in those versions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to downgrade the plugin to a version that contains XSS vulnerabilities. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser (reflected XSS) or store malicious code in the database (stored XSS) which will then be executed by other users. This could lead to privilege escalation, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated user can send a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `wpvr_version` parameter to downgrade the plugin to a specified vulnerable version.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to the WordPress site, and does not require any specific position within the network. The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
