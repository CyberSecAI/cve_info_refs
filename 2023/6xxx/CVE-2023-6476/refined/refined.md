    "CVE-2023-6476": {
        "description": "A vulnerability in CRI-O that involves an experimental annotation leading to a container being unconfined. This may allow a pod to specify and get any amount of memory/cpu, circumventing the kubernetes scheduler and potentially resulting in a denial of service in the node.",
        "root_cause": "A bug in the code allows any user to specify the experimental annotation `io.kubernetes.cri-o.UnifiedCgroup`, regardless of whether it's enabled on the node, bypassing the intended filtering mechanism.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Inadequate input validation",
            "Incorrect access control",
             "Resource exhaustion"
        ],
        "impact": "A pod can specify and obtain any amount of memory/cpu, circumventing the Kubernetes scheduler, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the node.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker with the ability to deploy pods on a Kubernetes cluster can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a pod manifest with the vulnerable experimental annotation.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify pod specifications within the Kubernetes environment.",
         "additional_details": "This vulnerability exists due to a flawed implementation of an experimental annotation that was intended to be restricted. This annotation when specified can allow unconfined resource requests in cgroupv2."
