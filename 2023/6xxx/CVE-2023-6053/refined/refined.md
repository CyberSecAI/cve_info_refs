The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA versions below v11.10 and v2017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into a SQL query. Specifically, the `$DELETE_STR` parameter is concatenated into a SQL statement without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied `$DELETE_STR` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Direct concatenation into SQL query:** The application is using direct string concatenation instead of parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious actors could modify or delete critical data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on database permissions and application logic, attackers could potentially elevate their privileges.
- **Blind SQL injection:** The provided example demonstrates how to perform a blind sql injection to extract information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `general/system/censor_words/manage/delete.php` endpoint.
- The attacker manipulates the `$DELETE_STR` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the `$DELETE_STR` parameter in the request.
