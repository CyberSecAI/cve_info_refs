- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a malicious authenticated read-write administrator to store a JavaScript payload via the web interface. This stored payload will then execute when viewed by another authenticated administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation**: When the stored JavaScript payload is executed, it disguises all associated actions as being performed by the unsuspecting authenticated administrator who is viewing the payload.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring a malicious authenticated read-write administrator to insert the malicious payload via the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated read-write administrator on the PAN-OS system. The attacker also requires that a separate administrator views the injected script.
