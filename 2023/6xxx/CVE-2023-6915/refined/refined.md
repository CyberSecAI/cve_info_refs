{
  "CVE-2023-6915": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `ida_free` function within the `lib/idr.c` file. This occurs when the function attempts to access the bitmap of a freed identifier when there are no allocated IDs nearby.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Null Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could trigger a denial of service by exploiting the null pointer dereference, leading to a system crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered internally when the `ida_free` function is called on an empty bitmap.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `ida_free` function call to exploit the vulnerability. It can be exploited locally."
