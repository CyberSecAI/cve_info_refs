{
  "CVE-2023-6546": {
    "Root cause": "A race condition in the GSM 0710 tty multiplexor (drivers/tty/n_gsm.c) in the Linux kernel",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local unprivileged user can escalate their privileges on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by executing GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled by two threads concurrently. The exploitation process uses userfaultfd and add_key to spray fake gsm_dlci objects.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to execute code on the target system. Knowledge of the path to the kernel text base via the world-readable '/sys/kernel/notes' file is needed for KASLR bypass.  SMP must be enabled on the target system"
  }
