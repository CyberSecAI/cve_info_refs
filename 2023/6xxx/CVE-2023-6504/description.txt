The User Profile Builder â€“ Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the wppb_toolbox_usermeta_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to expose sensitive information within user metadata.
