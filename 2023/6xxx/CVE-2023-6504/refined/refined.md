Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6504:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions **CVE-2023-6504** and describes a vulnerability in the "Profile Builder" WordPress plugin, aligning with the CVE description's requirement of vulnerability information. The content from Wordfence also specifically states the vulnerability is an "Insecure Direct Object Reference to Sensitive Information Exposure via user_meta Shortcode." Thus, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `wppb_toolbox_usermeta_handler` function in the Profile Builder plugin. This function is responsible for handling the `usermeta` shortcode.

*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**. The `usermeta` shortcode allows retrieval of user metadata, but it does not properly validate whether the user making the request has the authority to access the specified user's metadata.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers (with contributor-level access or higher) to potentially expose sensitive information contained within user metadata. This could include personal details, private settings, or other data not meant to be publicly accessible.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via the `usermeta` shortcode, which is a part of the Profile Builder plugin. An attacker can craft a malicious shortcode to access metadata of other users

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level access.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to insert and execute shortcodes, such as by creating a post or page, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow shortcode execution.

**3. Additional details from provided content**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Profile Builder plugin up to and including version 3.10.7.
*   Version 3.10.8 of the plugin contains a fix for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was identified by researcher Francesco Carlucci.

**Summary:**

The provided content details an IDOR vulnerability (CVE-2023-6504) in the Profile Builder WordPress plugin, where an authenticated user could potentially access another user's metadata via the `usermeta` shortcode due to a missing capability check. This vulnerability is fixed in version 3.10.8 of the plugin.
