{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The default configuration of Aquaforest TIFF Server allows access to arbitrary file paths due to insufficient restrictions and parameter handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Information Exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can enumerate files or directories, traverse directories, bypass authentication, or access restricted files, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information, including court documents, source code, and database credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting specific requests to the TIFF Server's exposed ASP.NET forms (e.g., using parameters in the `*.aspx` forms), an attacker can exploit the server's file handling mechanisms.",
    "required_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific user privileges are required on the target system. Access to the application is needed."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the way TIFF Server's ASP.NET forms process parameters, which allows it to source files from arbitrary locations. The software was originally designed for use on an intranet and was not intended to be exposed to the outside world. The vendor has provided guidance on how to improve security configurations, including allowlisting file paths, and has announced the sunsetting of the product. This vulnerability is associated with a deprecated version of the software."
