Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `parentid` parameter of the `/w_selfservice/oauthservlet/%2e./.%2e/general/inform/org/loadhistroyorgtree` endpoint before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. The attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify existing data, or even delete data.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The injection could be used to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by executing resource-intensive queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some specific cases, depending on the underlying database system and permissions it might be possible to run code on the server.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `parentid` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability as the example request demonstrates exploitation without prior login.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameters.
