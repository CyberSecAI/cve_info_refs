Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6636

**Vulnerability Description:** The `Greenshift – animation and page builder blocks` plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a lack of file type validation in the `gspb_save_files` function.

**Root Cause:**
- The `gspb_save_files` function, responsible for handling uploaded font files, lacks proper validation of the file extensions. This allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary extensions, not just the intended font file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the unrestricted upload of files due to missing file type validation. The code fails to check if the uploaded file's extension matches the allowed extensions for font files.
- **Missing File Type Validation:** The `gspb_save_files` function does not validate if the uploaded files are of the expected font file type which are defined in `$this->allowed_font_ext`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. This could include malicious scripts, PHP files, or other executables.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious code, attackers can gain control of the affected WordPress site.
- **Full Site Compromise:** Remote code execution can lead to a full compromise of the target website and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the server with arbitrary files through the settings form.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads malicious files through the plugin's settings page, exploiting the lack of file type validation in the `gspb_save_files` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or higher.
- **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be able to access the plugin's settings page where the font upload functionality is located.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by István Márton of Wordfence.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 7.6.3 of the plugin by adding a check to validate the file extension against the allowed list `$this->allowed_font_ext` before moving the uploaded file, as seen in the provided diff.
- The function `greenshift_download_file_localy` also has a check for file types, but it is not used in the font upload functionality.

**In Summary:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation in the `gspb_save_files` function, allowing an authenticated administrator to upload arbitrary files and potentially achieve remote code execution. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that uploaded files have allowed extensions.
