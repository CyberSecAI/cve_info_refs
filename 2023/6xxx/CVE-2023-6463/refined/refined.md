Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the XSS vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when adding a new user via the `/endpoint/add-user.php` endpoint. Specifically, the `first_name` parameter is not properly filtered, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
- The injected payload is stored and subsequently rendered without sanitization in the `/home.php` page when a user accesses this page

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected JavaScript code is stored in the database and then executed in a user's browser when they view `/home.php`, leading to persistent XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit `/home.php`.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    - Defacing the website by injecting arbitrary HTML.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code in the `first_name` parameter when making a POST request to the `/endpoint/add-user.php` endpoint.
- The payload is stored in the database.
- When a victim visits `/home.php`, the stored payload is retrieved and executed in their browser, because of lack of sanitization on this page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to `/endpoint/add-user.php`. They must be able to inject malicious data into parameters that will be stored and rendered in `/home.php`
- The attacker does not need any privileges to inject the payload.
