The content is related to the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Firestore settings object, including the private key used to initialize the Firebase Admin library, was being exposed when logging Firestore objects (e.g., WriteBatch, Transaction, DocumentReference). This was due to the settings object being serialized when `JSON.stringify` was called on these objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: The private key, which is a critical credential for accessing and managing Firestore, was being unintentionally exposed.
- Insecure logging practices:  Logging Firestore objects without sanitizing the settings led to a potential security risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to application logs could obtain the Firestore private key. This would grant them full access to the Firestore database, potentially leading to:
- Data breaches: unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
- Unauthorized access to the database
- Full control over data stored in firestore.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to application logs: Attackers would need access to the application logs where Firestore objects were being logged. This could be achieved through various means including compromised servers or cloud infrastructure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to application logs where Firestore objects are logged.
