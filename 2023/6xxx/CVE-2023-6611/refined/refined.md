The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA, affecting versions below v11.10 and v2017.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `$EMAIL_ID` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization in the `pda/pad/email/delete.php` route.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `$EMAIL_ID` parameter before incorporating it into the SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The provided example demonstrates how to perform blind SQL injection to extract the database name, implying more extensive data exfiltration or manipulation could be possible.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `pda/pad/email/delete.php` endpoint by manipulating the `$EMAIL_ID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `$EMAIL_ID` parameter. The attacker also needs the ability to observe response timing which is used for the blind SQL injection technique.
