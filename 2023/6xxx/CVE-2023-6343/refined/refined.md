{
  "CVE-2023-6343": {
    "Description": "Tyler Technologies Court Case Management Plus use of Aquaforest TIFF Server tssp.aspx allows authentication bypass.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient security checks on parameters within the `tssp.aspx` form of the Aquaforest TIFF Server, which is used by Tyler Technologies' Court Case Management Plus. The server does not properly validate the source of files, allowing for the potential to source files from arbitrary locations.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass",
       "Improper access control",
       "Path traversal"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can craft requests to the vulnerable `tssp.aspx` form, potentially leading to: \n- Unauthorized viewing of documents that should require authentication.\n- Directory listing of accessible directories.\n- File counting within accessible directories.\n- Detection of file existence in locations the TIFF Server has access to.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `tssp.aspx` form, manipulating parameters to access sensitive data and files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the affected Tyler Technologies Court Case Management Plus system utilizing the vulnerable Aquaforest TIFF Server. No prior authentication is needed."
