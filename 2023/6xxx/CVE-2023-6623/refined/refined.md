Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the PHP `extract()` function within the Essential Blocks plugin's template system without using the `EXTR_SKIP` flag. This allowed overwriting of existing variables, specifically the `$__file` variable which contained the path to the template being included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By controlling the `$__file` variable through the `extract()` function, an attacker can force the inclusion of arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable code is accessible through a publicly accessible REST API route, meaning no authentication is required to exploit it.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when it is passed to the `extract()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** Attackers can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure and in certain server configurations, remote code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker includes a file containing PHP code, the server could execute it. This could lead to complete compromise of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request to a publicly accessible REST API endpoint. Specifically, the `essential-blocks/v1/queries` route is targeted.
- **Query Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `attributes` parameter (specifically, the `__file` attribute) within the query to specify the path of the file they want to include.
- **Example Attack:**
  ```
   curl --url 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-json/essential-blocks/v1/queries?block_type=nonexisting_block&query_data=%7B%22source%22%3A+%22post%22%7D&attributes=%7B%22\_\_file%22%3A+%22%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22%7D'
  ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user account or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4.3 of the Essential Blocks plugin.
- The provided PoC targets `/etc/passwd` for demonstration of the LFI.
- The CVSS score of 9.0 indicates the critical severity of this vulnerability.
