Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `card_famne_export_settings` function within the "Manage Notification E-mails" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify user permissions before allowing access to the `card_famne_export_settings` function. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve plugin settings by exploiting this vulnerability. This may include sensitive configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability without needing to log in to the WordPress site. This suggests a direct access vector to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** Attackers do not need any level of access to the WordPress site and can be unauthenticated.
- **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Rafshanzani Suhada and reported by Wordfence.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.8.6 of the plugin by adding a capability check before allowing access to the export functionality.
- The fix involved adding `if( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) { return; }` to the `export-settings.php` file.
- The plugin uses filters to disable notification emails. In the updated version, the priority of these filters was lowered to 99 to ensure that other plugins do not overwrite the disabling of the notification emails.
