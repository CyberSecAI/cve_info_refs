- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient quoting when using `ksh`'s `eval` function within the `mk_tsm` agent plugin. This allows for malicious commands injected into the `ps` output to be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the `mk_tsm` plugin's use of `eval` without proper sanitization of input from the `ps` command. This leads to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve local privilege escalation to root on the monitored host.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious command that shows up in the output of the `ps` command is crafted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the monitored host.
