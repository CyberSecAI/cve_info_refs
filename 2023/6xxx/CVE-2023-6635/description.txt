The EditorsKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation on the 'import_styles' function in versions up to, and including, 1.40.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
