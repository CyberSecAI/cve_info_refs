{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the MLflow server following HTTP redirects by default when making HTTP requests. This behavior can be exploited if a malicious actor controls a URL that the MLflow server attempts to access. By redirecting the server to a different location, an attacker could potentially manipulate the server's interaction with external resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled HTTP Redirect: The MLflow server, by default, follows HTTP redirects without proper validation. This makes it susceptible to malicious redirects.",
     "Lack of configuration option: Prior to this fix, there was no option to disable redirects"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker controlling a URL accessed by the MLflow server could redirect the server to a malicious location, potentially leading to the server interacting with unintended resources or leaking sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious actor controlling a URL that the MLflow server is configured to access. By setting up a redirect from the controlled URL, the attacker could cause the MLflow server to interact with an attacker-controlled resource.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control a URL that the MLflow server will attempt to access. This could involve poisoning DNS records, intercepting network traffic, or compromising a service that the MLflow server interacts with."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fix_details": "The fix introduces an environment variable, `MLFLOW_ALLOW_HTTP_REDIRECTS`, which allows users to control whether the MLflow server follows HTTP redirects. When set to `false`, the server will no longer follow redirects.",
    "changes": [
      "Added `MLFLOW_ALLOW_HTTP_REDIRECTS` environment variable in `mlflow/environment_variables.py`",
       "Modified `mlflow/utils/request_utils.py` to use `MLFLOW_ALLOW_HTTP_REDIRECTS` env var to determine whether to allow redirects" ,
      "Added tests to ensure redirects can be enabled/disabled in `tests/utils/test_request_utils.py`"
