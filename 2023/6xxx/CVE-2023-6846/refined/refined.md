Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `mk_check_filemanager_php_syntax` AJAX function of the File Manager Pro WordPress plugin. This function is intended to check the PHP syntax of provided code by writing it to a temporary file (`fm_temp.php`) and then executing the `php -l` command on it. The core issue is the lack of proper capability checks, which allows any authenticated user with subscriber access or higher to execute this function and write arbitrary code to a PHP file, then execute that file using `shell_exec`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Code Execution:** The plugin uses `shell_exec` to execute the PHP command with the potentially malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
2.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The `mk_check_filemanager_php_syntax` function lacks proper capability checks, allowing authenticated users (including subscribers) to execute it.
3.  **Arbitrary File Upload:** Although the primary goal is syntax checking, the ability to write arbitrary PHP code to `fm_temp.php` means any authenticated user can upload malicious PHP files and execute them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to:

*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining control over the server.
*   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive information stored on the server.
*   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the content of the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Using the server to distribute malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
*   **Authenticated Users:** Exploitation requires an attacker to have an authenticated user account (subscriber level or higher) on the WordPress website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site, at least with subscriber level permissions.
2.  **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress website.
3.  **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know to send the POST request to the `mk_check_filemanager_php_syntax` AJAX function along with the filename, filemime, and code.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in File Manager Pro versions up to and including 8.3.4.
*   Version 8.3.5 introduces a capability check that limits execution of this function to admin users, effectively patching the vulnerability.
