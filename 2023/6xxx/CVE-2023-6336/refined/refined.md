Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). This means the software doesn't properly validate or sanitize file paths that might be provided by a user or an external source before attempting to access the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Link Following:** The application follows symbolic links or similar constructs without proper checks, which can lead to accessing files or directories outside the intended scope.
*  **User-Controlled Filename:** The application uses a filename that is influenced or fully controlled by the user, making it easier to exploit file access vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User-Controlled Filename:** An attacker could manipulate the file path to access sensitive data or perform actions the user does not have permission to do (File manipulation).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves manipulating file paths or using symbolic links to redirect file access to unintended locations on the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to control or influence the file paths that the HYPR Workforce Access software uses. This could involve manipulating input parameters or the environment that the application is running in.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable file access operation.

**Affected Product:**
* HYPR Workforce Access on MacOS

**Affected Version:**
*  < 8.7

**Fixed Version:**
* 8.7
