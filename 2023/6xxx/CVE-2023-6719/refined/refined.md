**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can compromise interactions between a user and the vulnerable application. By sending a specially crafted JavaScript payload, an attacker can gain full control of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted JavaScript payload to a user, who, upon interacting with the application, will trigger the injected script.
