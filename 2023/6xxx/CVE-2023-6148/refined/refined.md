Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6148:

**CVE-2023-6148**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Qualys Policy Compliance Scanning Connector Plugin does not properly sanitize Qualys API responses displayed on the job configuration page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin renders unsanitized API responses in the job configuration page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker who can configure jobs can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the browsers of other users who view the job configuration page. This could lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser.
*  **Attack Vectors**: The attacker must be able to configure jobs within the Jenkins instance that uses the vulnerable plugin. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the job configuration page with the malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:  The attacker needs to have the ability to configure jobs in Jenkins.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability is a stored XSS in the Qualys Policy Compliance Scanning Connector Plugin, where malicious scripts injected through Qualys API responses displayed on the job configuration page can be executed by users viewing that page.
