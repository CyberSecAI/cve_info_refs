Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by commit `1da75dfcecd4d169e34809ade55748384e8af6c1`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation of file paths used within the MLflow application. Specifically, the application was vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient handling of encoded URLs and relative path specifiers like `..`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application did not adequately sanitize input paths, allowing attackers to use sequences like `..` or URL encoded versions like `%2E%2E` to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files within the server's filesystem.
- **Insufficient URL Decoding:** The application was not consistently decoding URL encoded path components before validation. This allowed for malicious paths with URL encoded traversal sequences to bypass the initial checks.
- **Inconsistent Path Validation:** Path validation logic was flawed by not handling various edge cases (e.g. Windows specific paths like `C:\`, UNC paths, and paths with null bytes `%00` etc.)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. This could expose application configuration files, private keys, or other sensitive data, leading to privilege escalation or data breaches.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly stated, in some contexts, using the file traversal vulnerability to try and access non-existent files could result in a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** In combination with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, arbitrary file access might lead to remote code execution, further compromising the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves manipulating the path parameter in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts` function. This endpoint could be exploited to inject malicious path strings.
- Malicious paths could also be passed to `http_artifact_repo.list_artifacts`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the MLflow server and control the file path parameter.
- They must be aware of the exposed API endpoints which handle file paths.
- No specific authentication or privilege is explicitly required according to the provided content.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit message and code changes explicitly mention preventing path traversal with encoded URLs.
- The fixes involve URL decoding paths before validation and incorporating tests that include various malicious path patterns, including URL encoded sequences, null byte injections, and absolute paths.
- Tests also added for Windows-specific paths.
- The vulnerability was present in `mlflow/utils/uri.py`, `tests/server/test_handlers.py`, `tests/store/artifact/test_http_artifact_repo.py` and `tests/tracking/test_rest_tracking.py`.
