Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'Ready Function' field of the 3D FlipBook plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before storing it in the database.
- Lack of proper output escaping when displaying the stored data on a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- Potential consequences include:
    -  Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    -  Stealing user session cookies
    -  Defacing web pages
    -  Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    -  Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the 'Ready Function' field.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into this field.
- The injected code is then stored in the database.
- When a user views the page containing the vulnerable component the javascript executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs at least 'contributor' level access or higher.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the 3D FlipBook plugin up to and including 1.15.2.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.15.3
- The fix involves filtering unsecured content (css layers, ready function) from users with less than editor privileges.
- The vulnerable field is the 'ready_function' within the data for a book.
- Lower level users, such as contributors, can still modify the data for a book, and therefore inject malicious javascript, but the plugin now filters it out before display.
