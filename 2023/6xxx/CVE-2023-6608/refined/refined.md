The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA, affecting versions below v11.10 and v2017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly concatenated into an SQL query within the `general/notify/manage/delete.php` file. Specifically, the `$DELETE_STR` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user input is not validated before being used in an SQL query.
- Direct parameter splicing into SQL query:  The code directly incorporates the `$DELETE_STR` parameter into the SQL statement, creating the SQL injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database.
- Data exfiltration: Attackers can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.
- Database manipulation:  Attackers can modify or delete database records.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `$DELETE_STR` parameter via an HTTP request to `general/notify/manage/delete.php`.
- Parameter manipulation: By crafting a malicious value for `$DELETE_STR` parameter, the attacker can manipulate the SQL query to achieve their objectives.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the affected Tongda OA instance.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter `DELETE_STR` and the vulnerable route `general/notify/manage/delete.php`.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with crafted payloads to the vulnerable endpoint.

The provided content also demonstrates a blind SQL injection using a time-based approach. The attacker uses a crafted payload to determine that the first character of the database name is "t". This is achieved by using a query that introduces a delay when the character matches the guess.
