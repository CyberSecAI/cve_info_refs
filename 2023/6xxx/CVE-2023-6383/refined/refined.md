- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a directory listing issue, allowing unauthenticated users to access the debug log directory and download the debug logs. This leads to sensitive data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated users can download debug logs, potentially revealing sensitive information contained within.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is accessing the debug log directory via the URL: `https://your_site/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/debug-log-manager/`.
