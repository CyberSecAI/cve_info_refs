# CVE-2023-6530 – TJ Shortcodes – Stored XSS via shortcode – POC

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-6530 – TJ Shortcodes – Stored XSS via shortcode – POC

During the evaluation of the **TJ Shortcodes plugin**, a critical vulnerability was identified that permits the execution of **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks**. This flaw enables an attacker to inject **malicious scripts through a shortcode**, posing a risk of account takeover.

## **Main info:**

| CVE | **CVE-2023-6530** |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin | [TJ Shortcodes <= 0.1.3](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-junkie-shortcodes/) |
| Critical | **High** |
| All Time | **63 309** |
| Active installations | **2 000+** |
| Publicly Published | January 3, 2023 |
| Last Updated | January 3, 2023 |
| Researcher | Dmtirii Ignatyev |

| Plugin Security Certification by CleanTalk |  |

## **Timeline**

| October 17, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **TJ Shortcodes** have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| October 17, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| December 27, 2023 | The author fixed the vulnerability and released the plugin update |
| January 3, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-6530** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

In the process of testing the plugin, a vulnerability was found that allows you to implement **Stored XSS** on behalf of the contributor by embedding the shortcode in a new post, which entails account takeover

## **Understanding of XSS attack’s**

**XSS is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users**. In WordPress, XSS can manifest in various forms, with stored **XSS** being one of the most dangerous. Real-world examples include attackers embedding scripts in user-generated content, such as posts or comments, to compromise the accounts of other users.

## **Exploiting the **XSS** Vulnerability**

The identified vulnerability can be exploited by **embedding a malicious shortcode in a new post.**

> **POC**:
>
> [junkie-button url=”http://example.com” style=”grey” size=”small” type=”round” target='” onmouseover=”alert(/XSS/)”‘] Button Text[/junkie-button]
>
> \_\_\_

In this scenario, the `onmouseover` attribute contains a script that triggers an alert with the message **“XSS”** when the mouse hovers over the button.

The potential risk associated with this **Stored XSS** vulnerability is severe. Attackers could craft malicious shortcodes to execute arbitrary scripts, leading to account takeover, data theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the affected contributor. In real-world scenarios, this could result in the compromise of user accounts and sensitive information.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

* **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization for shortcodes to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Employ CSP headers to control which resources can be loaded and executed, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
* **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities within WordPress plugins.
* **Plugin Update:** Ensure the TJ Shortcodes plugin is regularly updated to include the latest security patches.
