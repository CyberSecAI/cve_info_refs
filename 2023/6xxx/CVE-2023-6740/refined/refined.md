- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `jar_signature` agent plugin executed the `jarsigner` binary as root, while the plugin itself is configured by the `oracle` user. This allowed a malicious `oracle` user to replace the `jarsigner` binary with a malicious script in the `JAVA_HOME` directory, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability due to insecure execution of a binary with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user (`oracle`) can gain root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attack by a user (`oracle`) who can modify files within the `JAVA_HOME` directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the system as the `oracle` user and the ability to modify files in the `JAVA_HOME` directory.
