Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6253

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Digital Guardian Agent Uninstaller caches the uninstall key in memory, and this key can also be extracted from the installer file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure handling of sensitive data (uninstall key) by caching it in memory.
- The uninstall key is pre-configured and can be read from the installer file (.msi).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A locally authenticated attacker with administrative privileges can:
    - Disable the Digital Guardian application temporarily.
    - Uninstall the application completely.
    - Terminate all agent processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Memory extraction:** An attacker can use debugging tools like WinDbg to extract the cached uninstall key from memory of the installer process.
- **Installer inspection:** The uninstall key can be retrieved from the installer file without requiring elevated privileges.
- **Brute-force:**  The `Terminator.exe` application can be used to brute-force the correct uninstall key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Locally authenticated access to the system.
- Administrative privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability and stop/uninstall the application.
- Ability to execute the installer and use debugging tools.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Fortra Digital Guardian Agent versions prior to 7.9.4.
- The vendor was initially unresponsive to vulnerability reports and was slow to provide a CVE ID.
- A proof of concept (PoC) was provided, including detailed steps for extracting the uninstall key and utilizing it to terminate the agent.
- The vendor considers the Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the PDF templates functionality to be "working as intended" and will not fix it. They recommend access controls and monitoring as mitigating controls.
- A workaround for the uninstall key caching issue involves changing the uninstall key immediately after deploying the Digital Guardian agent on the system.
