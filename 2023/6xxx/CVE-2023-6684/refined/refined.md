Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'ive' shortcode of the Ibtana â€“ WordPress Website Builder plugin. Specifically, the 'width' and 'height' attributes, which accept user-supplied values, are not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in the output HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected and permanently stored within the WordPress database. This occurs because user-provided input for the 'width' and 'height' attributes is not sanitized or escaped before being rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages or posts through the vulnerable shortcode attributes.
- **Compromised User Sessions:** When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script will execute within their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could use XSS to alter the appearance or functionality of the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the 'width' or 'height' attributes of the `[ive]` shortcode when creating or editing a page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level permissions or higher. This level of access is required to create or modify pages/posts and use shortcodes.
