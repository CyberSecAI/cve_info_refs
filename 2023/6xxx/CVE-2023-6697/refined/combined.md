### Description

The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the map id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.28 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

* Fixed issue where some marker descriptions would contain a line.js asset due to an earlier exploit. Our code will automatically clear descriptions with these values present
* Fixed issue where map edit link was vulnerable to an XSS could be executed via the map ID query parameter. Thanks Rafie Muhammad (Patchstack)
* Fixed issue where 'mb\_encode\_numericentity' would be called even when the function is not available within the environment
