The provided content relates to CVE-2023-41170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NETSCOUT Systems nGeniusONE version 6.3.4 build 2298.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means that malicious scripts can be stored on the server and executed by other users when they access the affected part of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or the redirection of the user to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable input field or via other mechanisms that permit storage of data within the application. Subsequently, when a user visits a page that displays this stored data, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable application's storage. No specific user privileges are mentioned in the provided description, so it is possible that this could be done through a regular user account or with a specific, but not high privilege.
