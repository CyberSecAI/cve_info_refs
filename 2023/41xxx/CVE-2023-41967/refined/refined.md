- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive information is not cleared after a debug/power state transition in the Gallagher Controller 6000.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to clear sensitive data after a debug or power state transition. This allows an attacker with knowledge of the default diagnostic password to view the controller's configuration via diagnostic web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view sensitive configuration data of the Gallagher Controller 6000.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the Controller 6000, combined with knowledge of the default diagnostic password, to access diagnostic web pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the Controller 6000 and must know the controller's default diagnostic password.
