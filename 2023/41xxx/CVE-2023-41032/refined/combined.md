SSA-190839: X_T File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Parasolid

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2023-09-12
2023-09-12
V1.0

SUMMARY

Parasolid is affected by out of bounds write vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application
reads ﬁles in X_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected applications, an
attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current
process.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted X_T ﬁles in Parasolid

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-41032

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted X_T ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-21263)

# BE-2023-0004

# BE-2023-0004: XMT file processing vulnerabilities in MicroStation.

**Bentley ID:** BE-2023-0004

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41032

**Severity:** 7.8

**CVSS v3.1:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Publication date:** 2023-12-31

**Revision date:** 2023-12-31

**Summary**MicroStation applications may be affected by out-of-bounds read and stack overflow vulnerabilities when opening maliciously crafted XMT (Parasolid) files. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

**Details**Using an affected version of MicroStation to open a JT file containing maliciously crafted data can possibly force an out-of-bounds read or force the execution of arbitrary code. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities within the parsing of JT files could enable an attacker to read information or execute code in the context of the current process.

**Affected Versions**

| **Applications** | **Affected Versions** | **Mitigated Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bentley MicroStation | <= 10.17.\*.\* | => 2023.0.1.24 |

**Recommended Mitigations**Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of MicroStation. As a general best practice, it is also recommended to only open files from trusted sources.

**Acknowledgement**Thanks to xina1i for discovering these vulnerabilities.

SSA-887122: X_T File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Simcenter Femap

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2023-11-14
2023-11-14

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap is affected by out of bounds write vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads files in X_T format.
If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected
applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context
of the current process.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted X_T files in Simcenter Femap

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting finite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-41032

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted X_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-21263)
