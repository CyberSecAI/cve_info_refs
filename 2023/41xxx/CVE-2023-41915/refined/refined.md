  "CVE-2023-41915": {
    "description": "OpenPMIx PMIx before 4.2.6 and 5.0.x before 5.0.1 allows attackers to obtain ownership of arbitrary files via a race condition during execution of library code with UID 0.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition vulnerability exists in the PMIx library when called by a process running with UID 0.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can obtain ownership of arbitrary files on the filesystem. This can lead to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the race condition in the PMIx library when called by a process with UID 0."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger execution of the vulnerable code within the PMIx library, with a process that has UID 0.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a race condition during the execution of library code when it's run with UID 0. This could happen with default configurations of certain workload managers, such as Slurm. The vulnerability is addressed in PMIx versions 4.2.6 and 5.0.1. Older versions are considered vulnerable."
