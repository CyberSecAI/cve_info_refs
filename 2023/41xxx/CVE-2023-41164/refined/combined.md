# Archive of security issues[¶](#archive-of-security-issues "Link to this heading")

Django’s development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues, as outlined in
[Django’s security policies](../../internals/security/).

As part of that commitment, we maintain the following historical list
of issues which have been fixed and disclosed. For each issue, the
list below includes the date, a brief description, the [CVE identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)
if applicable, a list of affected versions, a link to the full
disclosure and links to the appropriate patch(es).

Some important caveats apply to this information:

* Lists of affected versions include only those versions of Django
  which had stable, security-supported releases at the time of
  disclosure. This means older versions (whose security support had
  expired) and versions which were in pre-release (alpha/beta/RC)
  states at the time of disclosure may have been affected, but are not
  listed.
* The Django project has on occasion issued security advisories,
  pointing out potential security problems which can arise from
  improper configuration or from other issues outside of Django
  itself. Some of these advisories have received CVEs; when that is
  the case, they are listed here, but as they have no accompanying
  patches or releases, only the description, disclosure and CVE will
  be listed.

## Issues under Django’s security process[¶](#issues-under-django-s-security-process "Link to this heading")

|  |  | ================================================================================ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Following the fix for :cve:`2019-14232`, the regular expressions used in the |
|  |  | implementation of ``django.utils.text.Truncator``'s ``chars()`` and ``words()`` |
|  |  | methods (with ``html=True``) were revised and improved. However, these regular |
|  |  | expressions still exhibited linear backtracking complexity, so when given a |
|  |  | very long, potentially malformed HTML input, the evaluation would still be |
|  |  | slow, leading to a potential denial of service vulnerability. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The ``chars()`` and ``words()`` methods are used to implement the |
|  |  | :tfilter:`truncatechars\_html` and :tfilter:`truncatewords\_html` template |
|  |  | filters, which were thus also vulnerable. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The input processed by ``Truncator``, when operating in HTML mode, has been |
|  |  | limited to the first five million characters in order to avoid potential |
|  |  | performance and memory issues. |

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[NFS Kerberos in ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19384-tr-4616.pdf)

* How to configure NFS Kerberos support in ONTAP for Active Directory and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.

  management and name mapping for multiprotocol NAS access in ONTAP.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

[ONTAP 9.x STIG](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=network-other)

* Ver 1, Rel 1 of the NetApp ONTAP DSC 9.x STIG has been posted to the Security
  Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) Document Library.

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

##### FPolicy

[Cloud Insights with Cloud Secure](https://cloud.netapp.com/ci-sde-plp-cloud-secure-info-trial?hsCtaTracking=fefadff4-c195-4b6a-95e3-265d8ce7c0cd%7Cb696fdde-c026-4007-a39e-5e986c4d27c6)

[FPolicy Solution Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP: Varonis DatAdvantage](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4429.pdf)

[Antivirus Solution Guide for Trend Micro](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4312.pdf)

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationâs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.
