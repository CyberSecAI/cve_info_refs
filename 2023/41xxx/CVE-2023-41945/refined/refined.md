Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Assembla Auth Plugin does not properly verify if the permissions it is configured to grant are actually enabled. This means that even if an administrator has disabled specific permissions, the plugin might still grant them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permission Handling:** The plugin does not validate whether permissions are enabled before granting them.
- **Granting Deprecated Permissions**: It grants deprecated permissions like `Overall/RunScripts`, `Overall/UploadPlugins`, and `Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter` to users with `EDIT` access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unintended Access:** Users with `EDIT` permissions can gain `Overall/Manage` and `Overall/SystemRead` permissions, which they should not have based on the Jenkins configuration.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Pre-2.222 Jenkins):** The deprecated permissions granted can lead to arbitrary code execution in Jenkins versions before 2.222.
- **Access to Sensitive Features:** Plugins not adapted to the changes in Jenkins 2.222 may provide access to sensitive features to users with these deprecated permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker with `EDIT` permissions in Assembla can exploit this flaw to gain elevated privileges within Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have `EDIT` permission in Assembla, which maps to some level of access in Jenkins via the plugin.
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to Jenkins using this authorization strategy.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Assembla Auth Plugin version 1.14 and earlier.
- There is no fix available as of the time of the advisory.
-  Administrators can not remediate the permission issue because the plugin ignores disabled permissions when it assigns them.
