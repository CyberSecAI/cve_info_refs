- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Patreon WordPress plugin <= 1.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that targets the vulnerable functionality of the plugin. This request is then delivered to a victim user (who has the needed privileges and is authenticated) usually through a link or some other social engineering method. Upon user interaction, the crafted request executes in the user's session context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a user into executing it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but does need a privileged user to be authenticated for the attack to work.
