Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41618
*   **Affected Product:** Emlog Pro
*   **Affected Version:** v2.1.14
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Component/URL:** `/admin/article.php?active_savedraft=1`
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `active_savedraft` parameter when processing a request to `/admin/article.php`. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted GET request to `/admin/article.php?active_savedraft=1` with a payload in the `active_savedraft` parameter.
*   The provided example payload is: `%27%22()%26%25%3Czzz%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Ealert(9864)%3C/ScRiPt%3E`. This payload contains HTML characters like single and double quotes, parentheses, ampersands, percentage signs, angle brackets, and finally a Javascript snippet intended to trigger an alert box.
*   The vulnerable code doesn't neutralize these harmful characters which results in the JavaScript code being executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact:**

*   **Stealing client cookies:** Attackers could inject JavaScript to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Phishing scams:** Attackers could inject malicious code to redirect users to phishing sites or display fake login forms to steal credentials.
*   The attacker can change the JavaScript code to transform the attack content, meaning they can change the malicious script as they wish.

**Attack Vector:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious javascript in the `active_savedraft` parameter of the `/admin/article.php` endpoint.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL. This could involve techniques like embedding the URL in a phishing email, forum post, or another website.
*   The attacker does not require any privileges in the application other than sending a GET request with the malicious payload.
*   Since this is a reflected XSS, the malicious code executes in the context of the user who clicks the crafted link.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS in Emlog Pro v2.1.14 which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript via a URL parameter.
