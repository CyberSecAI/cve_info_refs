- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists when parsing specially crafted X_T files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could achieve remote code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered by a user opening a malicious X_T file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted X_T file.
