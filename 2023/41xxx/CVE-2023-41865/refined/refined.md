- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that are normally reserved for users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by making requests to the vulnerable function without the necessary authentication or authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber or have the same level of access.
