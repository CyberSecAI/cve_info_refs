The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Autodesk Customer Portal. Specifically, the issue is related to how support cases are managed and accessed by users, including those with expired licenses and those within the same account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Expired License Access:** Users with expired licenses were able to access support cases associated with their previous account if they were granted a new license for a new account. This was due to the user still being associated with the previous account's data.
2. **Shared Account Access:** By default, all users within an account could view and manage all support cases created by any other user in that same account.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive support case data. This includes:
- Confidential support communications and potentially sensitive information contained within these communications.
- Exposure of information about internal issues or problems experienced by an organization.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Expired License Vector:** A former employee with a new active license can access support case information from their previous employer.
2. **Shared Account Vector:** Any user with an active license within an organization can access any other user's support cases within the same organization, even if they are unrelated to the case.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **Expired License Vector:** The attacker needs to have had an active license associated with an organization in the past, then a new license for a different organization.
2. **Shared Account Vector:** The attacker needs an active license associated with the same account as another user whose cases they want to access. They would need to be an existing user on the Autodesk Customer Portal with an active license.
