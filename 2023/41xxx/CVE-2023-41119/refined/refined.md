Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_dbms_aq_move_to_exception_queue` function within EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). This function accepts a table's OID (Object Identifier) and then uses that to access the table using `SELECT` and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands, but it does so with superuser privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerable function allows a user with lower privileges to execute SQL commands with superuser privileges.
- Unrestricted Table Access: The function allows access to arbitrary tables using their OIDs without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can elevate their privileges to superuser level within the database.
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker could potentially execute any arbitrary SQL command within the database, gaining full access to data, manipulating or deleting data and system objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to call the `_dbms_aq_move_to_exception_queue` function with a specific table OID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to connect to the database and call functions, and must know the OID of a table in the database.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) versions prior to:
    - 11.21.32
    - 12.16.20
    - 13.12.17
    - 14.9.0
    - 15.4.0

**Remediation:**
- Users must upgrade to the patched versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server and apply database patches using `edb_sqlpatch`.
