Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-41705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of limitations on processing user-defined DAV user-agent strings. This means the system does not properly control or restrict the length or complexity of the user-agent strings it processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The system does not limit the processing of DAV user-agent strings, leading to excessive resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending specially crafted, long or complex user-agent strings, an attacker can cause the system to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a reduction or complete loss of availability of the OX App Suite.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be launched remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low privileges: A user with low privileges is required to trigger this vulnerability by sending malicious DAV user-agent strings.
- No user interaction is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified by the bug ID "MWB-2392".
- It was discovered on 2023-11-28.
- The vulnerability affects the OX App Suite backend versions 7.10.6-rev55, 7.6.3-rev71 and 8.20
- It is fixed in versions 7.10.6-rev56, 7.6.3-rev72 and 8.21
- The fix involves monitoring processing time of DAV user-agents and terminating requests when resource thresholds are reached.
