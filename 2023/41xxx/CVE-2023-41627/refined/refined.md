The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41627.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the sender of route table information by the E2Term component in near-RT RIC. E2Term relies on route table information sent by the Routing Manager to establish communication with other components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient validation of the sender of routing information.
- E2Term trusts routing information without verification of its origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can send forged route table information to E2Term.
- The attacker can deceive E2Term and disrupt its communication with other components by sending this information at a higher frequency using the Routing Manager.
- This can lead to poor resource utilization and service degradation within the O-RAN network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious xApp or compromised entity within the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network messages within the near-RT RIC environment.
- Ability to impersonate the Routing Manager or control a component that can send routing table updates.

**Additional Details:**

- The article details how a malicious xApp can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- It describes the specific mechanism by which the RMR table is manipulated.
- The vulnerability is part of a set of issues discovered related to Open RAN, including other CVEs such as CVE-2023-40998 and CVE-2023-40997
- The article also mentions that similar issues related to RMR hijacking have been reported independently, which adds to the importance of proper implementation and security measures.
