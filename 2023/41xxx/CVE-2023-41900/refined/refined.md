{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2023-41900",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in Jetty's OpenIdAuthenticator when it utilizes a nested LoginService. Specifically, if the LoginService revokes an already authenticated user, the current request is still processed as if the user is authenticated.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Weak authentication",
        "Bypass authentication"
      ],
      "impact": "A request on a previously authenticated session could bypass authentication after it had been rejected by the `LoginService`, leading to potential access to unauthorized resources.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the vulnerable application"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by using a previously authenticated session where the authentication has been revoked by the LoginService."
