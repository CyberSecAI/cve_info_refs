Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure to sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, user-supplied data in the login fields (username or password) is directly used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application is susceptible to SQL injection because it does not sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The login functionality does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing for the injection of SQL commands.
- **Use of Dynamic SQL:** The application uses dynamic SQL, constructing queries by concatenating user-provided strings directly into SQL statements, which makes SQL injection possible.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The application does not use parameterized queries (prepared statements), which would prevent SQL injection by treating user input as data rather than executable SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the system without needing valid credentials.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, or other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete records within the database, causing data integrity issues and potentially disrupting the application's functionality.
- **Further Malicious Actions:** Depending on the applicationâ€™s functionality and database permissions, an attacker could potentially execute further malicious actions, such as escalating privileges or compromising the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the login form, where an attacker can input malicious SQL code into the username and/or password fields.
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the login functionality, submitting a malicious payload designed to inject SQL commands into the executed query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of web applications and how to interact with HTML forms.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker must possess knowledge of SQL injection techniques and be able to construct SQL payloads that can manipulate the query logic.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the application's login page.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit payload `' OR '1'='1' -- -` is designed to modify the SQL query used for authentication, causing it to always evaluate to true.
- The payload leverages SQL comments `--` to ignore the rest of the query, effectively removing the original password check.
- This exploit bypasses authentication and grants unauthorized access.

The medium.com article provides a specific instance of a discovered SQL injection vulnerability including the steps to reproduce and the impact of the vulnerability, referencing CVE-2023-41615, and that article references a Zoo Management System.
The phpgurukul.com article provides information about a student management system, which, while not directly related to the Zoo Management system, outlines similar functionality and provides a downloadable project that may be vulnerable to the same type of SQL injection. It lists default credentials for login, which could also be a security risk.
