- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A type confusion vulnerability exists in the way Foxit Reader handles the `value` property of the `Radio Button` field. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the type of the `Radio Button` object after it has been modified by a JavaScript callback function, leading to the usage of an object with an incompatible type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type confusion (CWE-843) due to missing type validation of the `Radio Button` field after a callback execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Opening a specially crafted malicious PDF document with embedded JavaScript code.
  - Visiting a specially crafted, malicious website if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file or visiting the malicious website. No special privileges are needed.
