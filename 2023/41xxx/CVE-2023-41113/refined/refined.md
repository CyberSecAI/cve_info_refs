Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-41113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `accesshistory()` function in EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS), which, when combined with specific non-default configurations (CREATE DIRECTORY with file system access, non-default settings for `log_line_prefix` and `log_connections`), allows an authenticated user to potentially access file system information beyond their intended permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Permissions Bypass:**  Authenticated users can bypass intended file system access controls.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Users can obtain information about the existence of files, errors encountered when attempting to read them, and potentially limited content of the files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Access:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information about the file system, which could include database configuration files or other system files.
*   **Limited Content Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially infer contents of accessible files, depending on how much information is revealed through the logs and error messages

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attack requires an authenticated user account on the EPAS database instance.
*   **Specific Configurations:** The attack is dependent on specific configurations enabled by a superuser such as file system access being enabled via `CREATE DIRECTORY` and certain non-default settings for `log_line_prefix` and `log_connections`.
*   **Abuse of accesshistory()**: The vulnerability is triggered through the execution of `accesshistory()` function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account to connect to the affected EPAS database.
*   **Knowledge of Configurations**: The attacker must know how the vulnerable database instance is configured for filesystem access and logging.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, indicating a moderate severity.
*   The provided fix requires upgrading to specific versions of EPAS and then patching existing database clusters using `edb_sqlpatch`.
*   The patch modifies system objects, which may lead to some behavioral differences after applying the fix, and users should check if the changes may affect applications running against the database.
* The vulnerability is present in versions before 11.21.32, 12.16.20, 13.12.17, 14.9.0 and 15.4.0
