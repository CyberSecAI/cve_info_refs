{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises because H2O's TLS session resumption mechanism does not bind session IDs and tickets to specific server addresses, ports, or X.509 certificates. This allows an attacker, acting as a legitimate backend on one of the H2O instance's listening addresses/ports, to misdirect TLS connection resumptions from victim clients to an attacker-controlled backend. The vulnerability is present when H2O is configured to listen to multiple addresses or ports using host-level listen directives, each potentially connecting to different backend servers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "TLS session resumption misdirection: Session IDs and tickets are not bound to specific server address/port or certificate information.",
    "Lack of server context validation: H2O does not properly validate the server context during TLS session resumption."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack allows a malicious backend entity to intercept and observe HTTPS requests intended for other backends. Depending on the configuration, the attacker can forward the victim's HTTPS requests to their server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack involves a victim client attempting to resume a TLS connection, and an attacker redirecting the packets to a different address or port than intended. The attacker needs to be a configured backend server on one of the H2O instance's listening addresses/ports, and must be able to observe or inject packets exchanged between the client and H2O.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Must be a legitimate backend configured on one of the H2O instance's listening addresses/ports.",
    "Must be able to observe or inject packets exchanged between the client and H2O."
