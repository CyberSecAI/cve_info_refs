# Remote Code Execution

Critical

[angrybrad](/angrybrad)
published
GHSA-4w8r-3xrw-v25g
Sep 13, 2023

## Package

composer

craftcms/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0-RC1, <= 4.4.14

## Patched versions

4.4.15

## Description

### Impact

This is a high-impact, low-complexity attack vector. Users running Craft installations before 4.4.15 are encouraged to update to at least that version to mitigate the issue.

### Mitigations

* This has been fixed in Craft 4.4.15. You should ensure you’re running at least that version.
* Refresh your security key in case it has already been captured. You can do that by running the `php craft setup/security-key` command and copying the updated `CRAFT_SECURITY_KEY` environment variable to all production environments.
* If you have any other private keys stored as environment variables (e.g., S3 or Stripe), refresh those as well.
* Out of an abundance of caution, you may want to force all your users to reset their passwords in case your database was compromised. You can do that by running `php craft resave/users --set passwordResetRequired --to "fn() => true"`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID

* Removed the `resave/matrix-blocks` command.

### Development

* Entry type names and handles must now be unique globally, rather than just within a single section. Existing entry type names and handles will be renamed automatically where needed, to ensure uniqueness.
* Assets, categories, entries, and tags now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`).
* Element queries now have an `eagerly` param, which can be used to lazily eager-load the resulting elements for all peer elements, when `all()`, `collect()`, `one()`, `nth()`, or `count()` is called.
* Element queries now have an `inBulkOp` param, which limits the results to elements which were involved in a bulk operation. ([#14032](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14032))
* Address queries now have `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `addressLine3`, `administrativeArea`, `countryCode`, `dependentLocality`, `firstName`, `fullName`, `lastName`, `locality`, `organizationTaxId`, `organization`, `postalCode`, and `sortingCode` params.
* Entry queries now have `field`, `fieldId`, `primaryOwner`, `primaryOwnerId`, `owner`, `ownerId`, `allowOwnerDrafts`, and `allowOwnerRevisions` params.
* Entry queries’ `authorId` params now support passing multiple IDs prefixed with `and`, to fetch entries with multiple listed authors.
* User queries now have an `authorOf` param.
* Nested addresses are now cached by their field ID, and address queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
* Nested entries are now cached by their field ID, and entry queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
* GraphQL schemas can now include queries and mutations for nested entries (e.g. within Matrix or CKEditor fields) directly. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
* Added the `fieldId`, `fieldHandle`, `ownerId`, and `sortOrder` entry GraphQL fields. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
* Entries’ GraphQL type names are now formatted as `<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`, and are no longer prefixed with their section’s handle. (That goes for Matrix-nested entries as well.)
* Entries now have `author` and `authorIds` GraphQL field.
* Matrix fields’ GraphQL mutation types now expect nested entries to be defined by an `entries` field rather than `blocks`.
* Added the `entryType()` and `fieldValueSql()` Twig functions. ([#14557](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/14557))
* Added the `|firstWhere` and `|flatten` Twig filters.
* Removed the `craft.matrixBlocks()` Twig function. `craft.entries()` should be used instead.
* Controller actions which require a `POST` request will now respond with a 405 error code if another request method is used. ([#13397](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13397))

### Extensibility

* Elements now store their content in an `elements_sites.content` column as JSON, rather than across multiple columns in a `content` table. ([#2009](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2009), [#4308](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4308), [#7221](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7221), [#7750](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7750), [#12954](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12954))
* Slugs are no longer required on elements that don’t have a URI format.
* Element types’ `fieldLayouts()` and `defineFieldLayouts()` methods’ `$source` arguments must now accept `null` values.
* All element types can now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`), by implementing `craft\base\FieldLayoutProviderInterface` on the field layout provider class, and ensuring that `defineFieldLayouts()` is returning field layouts via their providers.
* All core element query param methods now return `static` instead of `self`. ([#11868](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/11868))
* Migrations that modify the project config no longer need to worry about whether the same changes were already applied to the incoming project config YAML files.
* Selectize menus no longer apply special styling to options with the value `new`. The `_includes/forms/selectize.twig` control panel template should be used instead (or `craft\helpers\Cp::selectizeHtml()`/`selectizeFieldHtml()`), which will append an styled “Add” option when `addOptionFn` and `addOptionLabel` settings are passed. ([#11946](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/11946))
* Added the `chip()`, `customSelect()`, `disclosureMenu()`, `elementCard()`, `elementChip()`, `elementIndex()`, `iconSvg()`, and `siteMenuItems()` global functions for control panel templates.
* Added the `colorSelect`, `colorSelectField`, `customSelect`, `customSelectField`, `languageMenu`, and `languageMenuField` form macros.
* The `assets/move-asset` and `assets/move-folder` actions no longer include `success` keys in responses. ([#12159](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12159))
* The `assets/upload` controller action now includes `errors` object in failure responses. ([#12159](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12159))
* Element action triggers’ `validateSelection()` and `activate()` methods are now passed an `elementIndex` argument, with a reference to the trigger’s corresponding element index.
* Element search scores set on `craft\events\SearchEvent::$scores` by `craft\services\Search::EVENT_AFTER_SEARCH` or `EVENT_BEFORE_SCORE_RESULTS` now must be indexed by element ID and site ID (e.g. `'100-1'`).

* Improved the initial page load performance for element edit screens that contain Matrix fields.
* Improved the performance of control panel screens that include field layout designers.
* Improved the performance of autosaves for elements with newly-created Matrix entries.
* Slugs are no longer required for elements that don’t have a URI format that contains `slug`.
* Garbage collection now deletes orphaned nested entries.
* Craft now has a default limit of 100 sites, which can be increased via `craft\ervices\Sites::$maxSites` at your own peril. ([#14307](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14307))
* Fixed a bug where multi-site element queries weren’t scoring elements on a per-site basis. ([#13801](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13801))
* Fixed an error that could occur if eager-loading aliases conflicted with native eager-loading handles, such as `author`. ([#14057](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/14057))
* Fixed a bug where layout components provided by disabled plugins weren’t getting omitted. ([#14219](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14219))
* Fixed a bug where element thumbnails within hidden tabs weren’t always getting loaded when their tab was selected.
* Added an SVG icon set based on Font Awesome 6.5.1. ([#14169](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14169))
* Updated Monolog to v3.
* Updated Axios to 1.6.5.
* Updated D3 to 7.8.5.
* Updated Punycode to 2.0.1.
* Updated XRegExp to 5.1.1.
