  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of configuration parameters passed to controller actions, specifically within the `ConditionsController`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data, which, when processed by the application, can lead to remote code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Remote Code Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution on the server by exploiting the vulnerability.",
      "attack_vector": "Network-based attack via crafted requests to controller actions",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application without authentication."
