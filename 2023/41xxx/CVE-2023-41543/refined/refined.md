Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint of JeecgBoot. The application attempts to prevent SQL injection by using a blacklist, but this is bypassed by crafting SQL payloads that don't include blacklisted keywords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `fieldName` parameter, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The blacklist approach is insufficient and can be bypassed by using alternative SQL syntax or functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including the database name.
- **Potential for Data Modification or Deletion:** The SQL injection vulnerability can be leveraged to modify or delete data. This is not explicitly demonstrated but is a standard risk associated with SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET request to the `/jeecg-boot/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint.
- **Manipulated `fieldName` parameter:** The `fieldName` parameter within the URL is used to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to make requests to the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint, as stated in the wechat article: "需要身份认证". The provided exploit requires a valid `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft payloads to bypass the implemented blacklist.
