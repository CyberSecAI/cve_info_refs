- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Autodesk Customer Portal had two access control issues: 1) users with expired licenses could still access support cases associated with the expired license if they gained a new license for a new account, and 2) users on an account could access case data created by other users on the same account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. Specifically, lack of proper session management and authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users could access support cases, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for unauthorized manipulation of support data. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of user's data related to support cases.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with an expired license and a new license for a different account could access support cases of the expired account. Any user with an active license within an account could access support cases created by other users on that account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have, or previously had, an Autodesk license and access to the Customer Portal. For the second issue, any active user on the account could access others' cases.
