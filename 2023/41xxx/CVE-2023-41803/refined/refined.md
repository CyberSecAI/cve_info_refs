- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case but generally involves unauthorized access or modification of resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a function that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user.
