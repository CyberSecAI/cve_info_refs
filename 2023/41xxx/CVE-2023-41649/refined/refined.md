- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has a broken access control issue due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control (missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function, but it could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable function within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user, meaning they do not need any prior access to the system.
