  "CVE-2023-41335": {
    "description": "When users update their passwords, the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities—it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process—it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased after a 48-hour window.",
    "root_cause": "A regression in a previous code change introduced a flaw where new passwords were temporarily stored in the database during password updates.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
    ],
    "impact": "Brief, temporary storage of plaintext passwords in the database during password updates. These passwords could be exposed in database backups or if the database is compromised within the 48-hour window.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with access to database backups or direct database access within the 48-hour window could potentially obtain the plaintext passwords.",
      "required_capabilities": "High privileges to gain access to database backups or the database directly."
