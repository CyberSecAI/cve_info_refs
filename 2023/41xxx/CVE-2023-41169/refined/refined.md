- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding within the nGeniusONE application, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the affected part of the application. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into input fields or other data storage mechanisms within the nGeniusONE application. When a user accesses the application and the stored script is rendered, the script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious script. This would likely require some level of access to the nGeniusONE application, depending on the specific injection point. It also appears that a normal user can exploit this vulnerability.
