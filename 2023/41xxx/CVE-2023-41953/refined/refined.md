- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies case-by-case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
