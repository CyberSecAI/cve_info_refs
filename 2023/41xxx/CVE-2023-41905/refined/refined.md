**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41905

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** nGeniusONE

**Affected Version:** 6.3.4 build 2298

**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Weaknesses:**
- Input validation failure: The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input, leading to injection of malicious scripts.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the input validation failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page viewed by other users.
- This malicious code can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
- The code could also redirect users to malicious websites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in a query parameter.
- The application reflects this payload back to the user's browser without proper sanitization, allowing it to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into visiting it.
- The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the application.

**Fix:**
- Upgrade to patch 6.3.4 P17 B2382 or later.
