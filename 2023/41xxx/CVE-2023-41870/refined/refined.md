- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**:  An unprivileged user can exploit the missing access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (i.e., a low-privilege user) to exploit the vulnerability.
