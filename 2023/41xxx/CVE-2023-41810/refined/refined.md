Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-41810:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41810
**Description:** Stored Cross Site Scripting Via Dashboard Panel
**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the dashboard panel functionality of Pandora FMS.
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means malicious scripts injected by an attacker are permanently stored on the server (in this case within a dashboard panel) and executed when other users view the dashboard.
**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a dashboard panel. When a user views the affected dashboard panel, the malicious script would execute in their browser. This could lead to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Defacement of the dashboard
    * Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user
    * Stealing of sensitive data accessible through the Pandora FMS interface
**Attack Vectors:**
    * An attacker with sufficient privileges to modify a dashboard panel can inject malicious JavaScript code. This is a stored XSS, so the victim does not have to be the attacker. Any user viewing the dashboard could be attacked if they have access.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to have the ability to modify or create dashboard panels, typically requiring some level of access to the Pandora FMS platform.
    * The attack is not direct in the way a reflected XSS would be, as any user with access to the dashboard could become a victim once it's stored.
**Fixed in Version:** 774-772.2
