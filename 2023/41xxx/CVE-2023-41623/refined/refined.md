Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-41623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection vulnerability in the `media.php` file of the emlog CMS.
*   The affected code snippet is: `$DB = Database::getInstance();$uid = Input::getStrVar('uid');`.
*   The `uid` parameter obtained from the GET request is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input (`uid`) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, specifically the `uid` GET parameter, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/media.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is `uid`.
*   **SQL Injection Payloads:** Attackers can use various SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability, including error-based, time-based blind, and boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs to have administrative access to the application to reach the `/admin/media.php` endpoint. However, the provided content indicates the cookie can be obtained with a tool like Burp Suite.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker must be knowledgeable about SQL injection techniques to craft and inject malicious payloads.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate HTTP requests, for instance, using tools like Burp Suite or sqlmap.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content includes examples of SQL injection payloads that can be used to exploit this vulnerability, showing error-based, time-based blind and boolean-based blind injection techniques.
*  The tool used to scan and find the payload is `sqlmap`.

**Affected Product:**
*   emlog CMS
*   Specifically, version pro2.1.14 is mentioned as an affected version.

This information provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability, its root cause, the potential impact, and how an attacker could exploit it.
