Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a result of broken access control. Specifically, it's due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the failure to properly restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles or permissions.
*   **Missing Checks:** The absence of authentication, authorization, or nonce token checks within specific functions is the technical cause of the broken access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, can execute actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary case-by-case, but it generally means an attacker could potentially modify settings, access sensitive information, or perform other unauthorized actions, potentially causing damage or disruption.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve an attacker exploiting the missing access control checks by directly accessing the vulnerable functions or features. The content doesn't specify the exact functions affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user with the minimum privilege of "Subscriber" on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable functions or features to exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "low" priority and severity (CVSS 4.3) because the specific impact is not catastrophic and it is unlikely to be exploited.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability until the plugin is updated to the fixed version.
*   The vulnerable plugin is "Super Socializer" and the vulnerable versions are <= 7.13.54.
*   The fix is available in version 7.13.55.
