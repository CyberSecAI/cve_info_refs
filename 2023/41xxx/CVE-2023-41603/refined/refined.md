- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Misconfiguration in IPv6 handling on D-Link R15 routers. Specifically, while IPv4 traffic is filtered by firewall rules, these same restrictions are not applied to IPv6 traffic on the WAN interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper firewall rules for IPv6 traffic on the WAN interface, leading to unrestricted access to services listening on IPv6.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can interact with services on the router that are intended to be accessible only by clients on the local network. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via the WAN interface using IPv6. Attackers can send IPv6 traffic to the router, bypassing IPv4 firewall restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to send IPv6 packets to the WAN interface of the vulnerable router.
