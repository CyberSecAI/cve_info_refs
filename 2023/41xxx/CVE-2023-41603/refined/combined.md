R15 :: H/W Rev. Ax :: F/W v1.08b02 and lower :: Misconfigured IPv6 may pass traffic from WAN to LAN

**Overview**

On August 21, 2023, a 3rd party security researcher reported the EAGLE PRO AI R15 hardware revision Ax with firmware version v1.08.02 with a IPv6 vulnerability

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches. The 3rd party publically disclosed the issue prior to the patches being available on our standard 90 day security patch release schedule. We do not recommend security researches act in this manner as they expose end-users to further risks without patches being available from the manufacture.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.

**Report information**

**3rd Party**

**Report:**

A network misconfiguration is present in D-Link R15 routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network. (similar to CVE-2022-4390)

Estimated on the automatic download server after full QA test is E'Sept'23.
