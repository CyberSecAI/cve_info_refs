Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Automatic YouTube Gallery Plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to implement proper access control mechanisms. This means that the plugin doesn't adequately verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed but is described as varying on a case by case basis. However, the vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable function in the plugin, which lacks proper access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site, having at least 'subscriber' level privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects the Automatic YouTube Gallery plugin versions 2.3.3 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is classified as low severity, and is unlikely to be exploited.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated to version 2.3.5 or later, where the vulnerability has been fixed.
