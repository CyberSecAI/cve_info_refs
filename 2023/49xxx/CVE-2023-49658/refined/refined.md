Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation for the `bank_details` parameter in the `party_submit.php` resource. This parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unfiltered user-supplied data being used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the database: A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database, including sensitive information such as user credentials, financial records, and other business-critical data.
- Potential for full system compromise: Depending on database permissions and the underlying operating system, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges and execute commands on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is remote since this is a web application that can be accessed over the network.
- Input: The attacker crafts malicious SQL code within the `bank_details` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, including the vulnerable parameter.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerable code is located in `party_submit.php`:

```php
$party_name=$_POST['party_name'] ;
$contact = $_POST['contact'];
$cin_no = $_POST['cin_no'];
$pan_no = $_POST['pan_no'];
$party_address = $_POST['party_address'];
$bank_details = $_POST['bank_details'];
$gstn_no = $_POST['gstn_no'];
$adhar_no = $_POST['adhar_no'];
$status =1;

$qry= mysqli_query($con,"INSERT INTO party_details (party_name,contact,gstin,pan_no,cin_no,party_address,bank_details,status) VALUES ('$party_name', '$contact','$gstn_no', '$pan_no','$cin_no','$party_address','$bank_details','$status')");
```

This code directly uses the `$_POST['bank_details']` value in the INSERT SQL query without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code, potentially leading to database compromise.
