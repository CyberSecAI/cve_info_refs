- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The teachPress plugin for WordPress versions <= 9.0.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities. The specific impact would depend on the actions that can be triggered via the vulnerable requests.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request sent to the victim's browser while they are authenticated to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious link or website to execute the forged request.
