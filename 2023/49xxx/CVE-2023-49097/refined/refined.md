- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-Host` header to construct links in password reset emails. If these headers are manipulated by an attacker, the password reset link can be pointed to a malicious site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Host header injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the secret password reset code when a user clicks the manipulated link and use it to reset the user's password, leading to account takeover. Accounts with MFA or Passwordless enabled are not affected by this attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, by manipulating the `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-Host` headers in the HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious request to the vulnerable ZITADEL instance and get a user to click on the link in the password reset email.
