Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-49700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer copy operation within the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) component. Specifically, a string operation in the Streamingmedia interface copies data from a source buffer to a fixed-size destination buffer without properly checking the size of the source buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-120: Copy into fixed-size buffer:** The code copies data into a fixed-size buffer without verifying if the source data's size exceeds the destination buffer's capacity. This can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Partial Loss of Integrity (I:H):** A successful exploit could lead to data corruption due to the overflow, potentially modifying data beyond the intended buffer.
- **Partial Loss of Availability (A:L):** The overflow may also lead to a partial loss of availability, potentially causing the system to crash or behave erratically.
- **No impact on confidentiality (C:N):** The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local (AV:L):** The attack vector is local, meaning that the attacker must have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low privileges (PR:N):**  No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction (UI:N):** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Scope Changed (S:C):** The vulnerability can affect components beyond the vulnerable module.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- ASR1803
- ASR1806

**CVSS Score and String:**
- **CVSS Score: 6.7 (Medium)**
- **CVSS String: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L**

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the Modem's IMS component.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "Security best practices violation."
- The CVSS string indicates that the attack complexity is high (AC:H), suggesting that some specific conditions or timing might be required to exploit the vulnerability successfully.
