- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress PayTR Taksit Tablosu Plugin versions 1.3.2 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact depends on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that is sent to the vulnerable website and will be executed by a logged in user who visits a malicious page or link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged in, privileged user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious web page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
