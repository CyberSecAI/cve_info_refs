- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection in the `/admin/nav/save` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly submitting a crafted request, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the navigation management area (e.g., adding or modifying navigation entries).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that makes a POST request to `/admin/nav/save` with attacker-controlled parameters. This page can be hosted on an attacker-controlled server and sent to a victim through various methods like email or links on other websites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious HTML page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target application.
