The content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the article management department of the `dreamer_cms` version 4.1.3, as hosted on GitHub at <https://github.com/iteachyou-wjn/dreamer_cms>.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user input when creating or editing articles. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the article content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious script is permanently stored within the application's database, and executed whenever a user views the affected article.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize user-supplied data, specifically when handling article content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential for account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the article content via the article management interface.
- Specifically, the provided PoC uses the `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>` payload to trigger an alert box.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create or edit articles within the affected application.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges.
