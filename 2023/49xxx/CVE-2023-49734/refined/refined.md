{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An authenticated Gamma user, upon creating a dashboard and adding charts, automatically becomes an owner of the charts, leading to incorrect write permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Privilege escalation due to incorrect permission assignment. A Gamma user gains write access to charts they did not originally own, simply by adding them to a dashboard.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated Gamma user can gain write permissions to charts they shouldn't have, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires a valid account with Gamma user privileges, and involves the creation of a dashboard followed by addition of target charts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated Gamma user within the affected Apache Superset instance."
