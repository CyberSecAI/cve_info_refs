Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by the `mjs_op_json_stringify` function in the `mjs.c` file. This function is used to serialize data into JSON format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow in `mjs_op_json_stringify`. The specific cause is not described, but the provided stack trace indicates that excessive recursion or an unbounded operation within the function is filling the stack.
- Out-of-bounds write (this is how the user categorized it, but the ASAN output specifies stack overflow)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can trigger the stack overflow, causing the program to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `mjs_op_json_stringify` function, triggered by a crafted input that causes excessive recursion or other stack-exhausting behavior.
- Specifically, a malicious JSON object is passed to `mjs_op_json_stringify`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input to the `mjs` program that triggers the vulnerable `mjs_op_json_stringify` function.
- No specific privileges are mentioned in the description; the attacker is assumed to be able to execute the `mjs` program.
- The program can be triggered via the command line using a crafted poc file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `mjs` version 2.20.0 (commit `b1b6eac`).
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided in a `poc.zip` file that can trigger the vulnerability.
- The ASAN output provides a stack trace showing the call sequence leading to the overflow.
