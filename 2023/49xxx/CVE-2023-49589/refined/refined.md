**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `createRecoverPass()` function, where the recovery code is generated. It encrypts a JSON object containing the current time plus 600 seconds. Because the timestamp is the only variable and an attacker can induce multiple requests at the same time, the generated recovery codes can be identical.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient entropy in password recovery mechanism.
- Predictable recovery codes due to lack of random component in the encryption process besides the static salt
- Lack of rate limiting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary user password recovery.
- Privilege escalation by resetting an administrator's password.
- Full control of the affected account by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending HTTP requests to the `userRecoverPass.php` endpoint.
- Performing concurrent requests for password recovery.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Basic user privileges on the affected application.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Ability to make concurrent requests for password recovery of multiple users.
