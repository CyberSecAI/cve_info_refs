- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the generation of error messages that contain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is leaking potentially sensitive information through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, and the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any privileges or user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
