- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress First Order Discount Woocommerce Plugin (versions <= 1.21) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts will vary on a case by case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through malicious links or scripts that trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page containing malicious code, to trigger a request to the vulnerable website. The user needs to have the proper authentication on the target site.
