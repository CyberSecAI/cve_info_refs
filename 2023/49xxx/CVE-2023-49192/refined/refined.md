- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Enhanced Text Widget plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The specific impact varies, but it generally allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting a function that lacks proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be unauthenticated, meaning they do not need any prior access to the WordPress system.
