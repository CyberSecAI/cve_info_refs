  "CVE-2023-49083": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL-pointer dereference when loading PKCS7 certificates due to a missing check for a NULL value in the p7.d.sign field.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability which leads to a segmentation fault.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), causing system instability and potential disruption of application availability. The vulnerability impacts any application attempting to deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when calling the `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` functions with a specially crafted PKCS7 blob. This can be done through a network (as seen in the CVSS score) by providing a malicious PKCS7 object to a vulnerable application.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PKCS7 blob to the vulnerable application to trigger the NULL pointer dereference, but does not require any privileges or user interaction."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was not checking if the `p7.d.sign` field is NULL before accessing its `cert` field.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL pointer dereference due to missing null check.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) by causing a segmentation fault.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted PKCS#7 bundle with no certificates.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PKCS7 bundle with no certificates to the vulnerable `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` functions."

     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL-pointer dereference when loading PKCS7 certificates.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL-pointer dereference in `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` and `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` functions when processing a PKCS7 bundle with no certificates.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exploiting this vulnerability results in a segmentation fault, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) in applications attempting to deserialize a malformed PKCS7 blob/certificate.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malformed PKCS7 blob that lacks certificate data to the `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` functions.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted PKCS7 input, but does not require any specific privileges or user interaction."
