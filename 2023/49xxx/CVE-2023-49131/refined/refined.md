- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to uninitialized pointer access while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted PAR file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file. The attacker needs local access to the target system since the attack vector is a local file.
