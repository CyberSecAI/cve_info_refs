| [@vorfreuder](https://github.com/vorfreuder) , I just wonder, why are you running a fuzzer vs. a compiler? If you can control sources of an assembler, you can do a lot worse than exploit a compiler -- you can insert any code. Can you elaborate on motivation here? |

If you can control sources of an assembler, you can do a lot worse than exploit a compiler -- you can insert any code. Can you elaborate on motivation here?  I discovered this program through recent fuzzing papers and subsequently employed it to assess the effectiveness of my fuzzer. |
