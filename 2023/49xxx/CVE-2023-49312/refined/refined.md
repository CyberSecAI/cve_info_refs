Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of insecure license key validation and the disclosure of sensitive information in error messages. The application validates the license key against the MAC address of the machine it is activated on. However, this validation can be bypassed by extracting the license key from memory and then changing the MAC address of another system to match the one for which the license was originally issued.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **License Key Extraction:** The application stores the license key in memory in a way that it can be easily extracted using tools like Process Hacker.
2.  **MAC Address Disclosure:** The application reveals the target machine's MAC address in the error message when an incorrect license key is used.
3.  **MAC Address Spoofing:** The application does not have a robust method to ensure that the MAC address being used for the license activation is genuine. The MAC address can be modified using the device manager settings.
4.  **Insecure license key validation:** The license key validation mechanism relies on a MAC ID check, which is easily bypassed by attackers who have access to both the valid license key and the targeted system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **License Violations:** Attackers can use a single license key on multiple systems, bypassing the intended license enforcement and causing financial loss to the software vendor.
*   **Compromised Licensing System:** The integrity of the licensing system is undermined, as attackers can freely use the software without paying for proper licensing.
*   **Software Piracy:** The vulnerability enables software piracy, as attackers can use cracked versions of the software without needing a valid license.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker requires local access to the machine where the application is installed.
*   **Memory Analysis:** The attacker needs to use tools to extract the license key from the application's memory.
*   **MAC Address Manipulation:** The attacker needs to modify the MAC address of the target machine, and must have administrative access to do so.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Proficiency:** The attacker needs some technical skill to use memory analysis tools and modify network settings.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs physical or remote access to the system running the vulnerable application.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs administrative privileges on the target machine to change the MAC address.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both trial and paid licenses.
