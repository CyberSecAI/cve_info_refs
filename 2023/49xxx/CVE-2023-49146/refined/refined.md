The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49146.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of HTML comments within the `dom-sanitizer` library. Specifically, a greedy regular expression used in the sanitization process could be bypassed using specially crafted comments, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of HTML comments.
- Use of a greedy regular expression that could be circumvented.
- Potential for XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page, which can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Defacement
- Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious HTML comments into data processed by the vulnerable `dom-sanitizer`.
- The injected comments bypass the sanitization logic and allow the inclusion of executable javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input that is processed by the vulnerable `dom-sanitizer`.
