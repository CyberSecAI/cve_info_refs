Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-49293

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Vite's `server.transformIndexHtml` function handles the request URL when transforming HTML containing inline module scripts. When the `appType` is set to `'custom'`, the original request URL is passed unmodified to `server.transformIndexHtml`. If the URL contains a malicious payload, it's injected into the transformed output due to how inline module scripts are processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability caused by the injection of arbitrary HTML into the transformed output via a malicious URL query string.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `server.transformIndexHtml` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the request URL when generating proxy script paths, allowing for injection of HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft:** The injected script could steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
- **Page Defacement:** The injected script can alter the page's appearance or behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious payload as a query parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to click on the malicious URL while running the dev server, for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing a specific payload designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the crafted URL while the Vite dev server is running with `appType: 'custom'` and a vulnerable version of vite.
- The target application needs to use `appType: 'custom'` and use `server.transformIndexHtml` in a way that exposes it to the request URL. The HTML entry must also contain an inline script.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is particularly relevant in development-mode SSR scenarios where `vite.transformHtml` is often called with the original request URL.
- The vulnerability exists because of the way Vite generates URLs for inline module scripts in custom app types which does not properly sanitize the URL.
- The specific vulnerable versions are:
    - >=4.4.0 <=4.4.11
    - 4.5.0
    - >=5.0.0 <=5.0.4
- The fix was released in:
    - >=4.4.12 <4.5.0
    - >=4.5.1 <5.0.0
    - >=5.0.5
- The provided content includes examples showing different scenarios where the vulnerability is exposed and not.
- The vulnerability is rated as **Moderate** with a CVSS score of 6.1.
