### @jscheffl **[jscheffl](/jscheffl)** commented [Dec 2, 2023](#issue-2022128153)

This PR changes the web UI trigger form to be shown always when calling via GET. Before it was possible to "accidentally" make a trigger when no form parameters were specified in a DAG and you passed the trigger URL along.

Now the UI uses POST when clicking.

How to test:

* Open your test env on the branch and run it via breeze on this branch
* Open the UI and log-in with your user
* Use the same window keeping the login context and call <http://localhost:28080/dags/dataset_produces_1/trigger> with the browser and see the trigger form popping up (Which in main will directly execute a trigger)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Subject: CVE-2023-49920: Apache Airflow: Missing CSRF protection on
 DAG/trigger

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow 2.7.0 before 2.8.0

Description:

Apache Airflow, version 2.7.0 through 2.7.3, has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to trigger a DAG in a GET request without CSRF validation.¬†As a result, it was possible for a malicious website opened in the same browser - by the user who also had Airflow UI opened - to trigger the execution of DAGs without the user's consent.
Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or later which is not affected
