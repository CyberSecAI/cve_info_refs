Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the DAG trigger functionality in Apache Airflow's web UI. Specifically, the vulnerability existed when triggering a DAG using a GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The application did not validate the origin of the DAG trigger request made via GET, allowing an attacker to potentially forge requests.
- **Unintentional DAG triggering:**  Prior to the fix, simply accessing the trigger URL for a DAG (via a GET request) could accidentally trigger its execution if no form parameters were required by the DAG, particularly when an authenticated user had the Airflow UI open.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could create a malicious website that, when visited by an authenticated Airflow user, would send a crafted GET request to trigger a DAG in Airflow without the user's consent or knowledge.
- This could lead to the execution of arbitrary workflows, potentially resulting in data manipulation, resource consumption, or denial of service depending on the DAG's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to host a website that contains the crafted GET request targeting the vulnerable Airflow instance.
- **Social Engineering:**  An attacker would need to trick an authenticated Airflow user to visit the malicious website while they are also logged into the Airflow UI.
- **Browser-based attack:** The attack leverages the user's browser and existing authentication session with the Airflow instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a web page and lure a user who is authenticated with the targeted Airflow web interface to visit the malicious page.
- The attacker does not require direct access to the Airflow server or credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the DAG trigger functionality in the web UI to use HTTP POST requests instead of GET requests. The change also makes sure a trigger form is presented when calling the trigger URL with a GET request, preventing unintentional DAG triggers.
- The fix was implemented in [this pull request](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36026).
- The vulnerability is present in Apache Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.7.3.
- Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or later.
