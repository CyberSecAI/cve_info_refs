- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing validation of the `Digest` and `Host` headers in the HTTP message signature verification process during ActivityPub server-to-server federation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper header validation in the signature verification process, allowing attackers to forge requests. Specifically, the absence of `Digest` and `Host` header validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can impersonate any remote user, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or other malicious activities on the affected Misskey instance.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the ActivityPub server-to-server federation protocol by sending crafted requests to the `inbox` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Misskey instance using the ActivityPub protocol. No special privileges are required, and user interaction is not needed for exploitation. The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that includes a forged signature and bypass the missing header validations.
