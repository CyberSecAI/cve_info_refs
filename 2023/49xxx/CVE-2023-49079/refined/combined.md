# Misskey's missing signature validation allows arbitrary users to impersonate any remote user.

Critical

[syuilo](/syuilo)
published
GHSA-3f39-6537-3cgc
Nov 25, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=2023.11.0

## Patched versions

2023.11.1-beta.1

## Description

### Authors

[@yunochi](https://munochi.moe/%40yuno)\*, [@perillamint](https://social.silicon.moe/%40perillamint)\*

### Summary

Misskey's missing signature validation allows arbitrary users to impersonate any remote user.

### Details

When Misskey has to verify the remote actor is eligible to `POST` into

the `inbox`, it only validates its HTTP message signature.

Due to lack of the header validation such as `Digest` and `Host`, it allows

attackers can spoof arbitrary users using ActivityPub server-to-server federation

protocol.

## Severity

CVSS v4.0 score: 7.1 (High)

Vector String: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CVSS v3.1 score: 9.3 (Critical)

Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

### PoC

Included in mailed tarball. See `/exploit`

### Possible mitigation

#### Server administrators

Configure the reverse proxy to explicitly filter out the requests with a

non-matching `HOST` header. Since most ActivityPub implementation which

uses HTTP message signature to authenticate server-to-server federation

includes `HOST` in their signature, it will provide a not-perfect-but-practical

defense against this attack.

Also, use a firewall to block external requests bypassing the reverse

proxy.

**This vulnerability has been fixed in v2023.11.1; updating to v2023.11.1 or later is strongly recommended.**

#### Misskey maintainers

There is a patch that implements missing validation and submitted using the GHSA private fork feature. See branch `advisory-fix-1` for the patch.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
