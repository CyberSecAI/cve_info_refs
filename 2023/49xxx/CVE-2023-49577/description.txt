The SAP HCM (SMART PAYE solution) - versions S4HCMCIE 100, SAP_HRCIE 600, SAP_HRCIE 604, SAP_HRCIE 608, does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. After successful exploitation, an attacker can cause limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
