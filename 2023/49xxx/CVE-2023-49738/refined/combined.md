# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1881

## WWBN AVideo image404Raw.php information disclosure vulnerability

##### January 10, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-49738

##### SUMMARY

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the image404Raw.php functionality of WWBN AVideo dev master commit 15fed957fb. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file read.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

WWBN AVideo dev master commit 15fed957fb

##### PRODUCT URLS

AVideo - <https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

##### DETAILS

AVideo is a web application, mostly written in PHP, that can be used to create an audio/video sharing website. It allows users to import videos from various sources, encode and share them in various ways. Users can sign up to the website in order to share videos, while viewers have anonymous access to the publicly-available contents. The platform provides plugins for features like live streaming, skins, YouTube uploads and more.

The `view/img/image404Raw.php` file is used to show an image when a 404 (Not Found) error is triggered.

The image to be shown is passed via the `image` GET parameter or via the whole `REQUEST_URI` [1]:

```
[1] $imageURL = !empty($_GET['image']) ? $_GET['image'] : $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
[2] $rootDir = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../';
    if($imageURL == 'favicon.ico'){
        $imgLocalFile = "{$rootDir}/videos/{$imageURL}";
    }else{
        $imgLocalFile = "{$rootDir}/{$imageURL}";
    }

    if (file_exists($imgLocalFile)) {
        // Determine the content type based on the file extension
        $fileExtension = strtolower(pathinfo($imgLocalFile, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

        switch ($fileExtension) {
            case 'jpg':
            case 'jpeg':
                $type = 'image/jpeg';
                break;
            case 'png':
                $type = 'image/png';
                break;
            case 'webp':
                $type = 'image/webp';
                break;
            case 'gif':
                $type = 'image/gif';
                break;
            default:
                $type = 'image/jpeg'; // Default to jpg if the extension is not recognized
                break;
        }

        // Serve the final image
        header("HTTP/1.0 200 OK"); // The image exists, so it's not a 404
        header('Content-Type: ' . $type);
        header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($imgLocalFile));
[3]     readfile($imgLocalFile);
        exit;
    }

```

The `image` parameter, fully under attacker control, is appended to `$rootDir` [2] and finally read and echoed at [3].

This allows an attacker to read any file in the webserver, which can lead to further privilege escalation.

In practice, this issue allows an attacker to read `videos/configuration.php`, which contains the `salt` used for various encryptions made by AVideo. Knowledge of the salt can be used to achieve administrator privileges as shown in TALOS-2023-1900.

Note that this issue is also exploitable by requesting `view/img/image404.php`, as that file includes the vulnerable `image404Raw.php` file.

### Crash Information

This request retrieves `videos/configuration.php`:

```
curl -k 'https://localhost/view/img/image404Raw.php?image=videos/configuration.php'

```

Similarly for `image404Raw.php`:

```
curl -k 'https://localhost/view/img/image404.php?image=videos/configuration.php'

```
