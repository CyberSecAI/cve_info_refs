- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `image404Raw.php` file in WWBN AVideo uses a user-controlled GET parameter `image` to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `image` GET parameter, allowing an attacker to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) or absolute paths to read files outside the intended directory.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The `readfile()` function outputs the content of the file specified by the manipulated path to the client.
    - **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73):** The file path is constructed using user-controlled input without any validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the web server, which may include configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data. Specifically, the report mentions that the `videos/configuration.php` file can be accessed using the vulnerability. This file contains the `salt` used for various encryptions by AVideo, which can be used to further compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `image404Raw.php` or `image404.php` with a malicious value in the `image` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the web.
