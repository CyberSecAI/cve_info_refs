## What's Changed

#### Feature: Support for Keycloak 23

* Update to keycloak 23.0.0 by [@Ansa89](https://github.com/Ansa89) in [#20](https://github.com/instipod/DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator/pull/20)

#### Security Fix: Changed HTTP redirect to Duo from HTTP 307 (Temporary Redirect) to HTTP 303 (See Other)

* Resolves an issue where user credentials were transmitted to Duo during the redirect due to the use of an incorrect redirect status code. Using HTTP 307 caused browsers to resend POST data (containing user credentials) to a Duo controlled endpoint outside of the Keycloak server, this was resolved by changing the redirect status code to HTTP 303 which causes browsers to change the request method to GET and not include the POST data when redirecting.
* This issue impacted all versions of the authenticator before 1.0.8 Final
* Security report credit to Benjamin Taylor of Cisco ASIG
* Fixes [CVE-2023-49594](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-23qf-mx2g-p3gq "CVE-2023-49594") / Cisco TALOS-2023-1907

#### Bug Fix: Broken WebAuthn in Keycloak when using authenticator

* Fix [#21](https://github.com/instipod/DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator/issues/21) by [@Ansa89](https://github.com/Ansa89) in [#22](https://github.com/instipod/DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator/pull/22)

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1907

## instipod DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator challenge information disclosure vulnerability

##### December 23, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-49594

##### SUMMARY

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the challenge functionality of instipod DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator 1.0.7 plugin. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. A user logging into Keycloak using DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator plugin triggers this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

instipod DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator 1.0.7

##### PRODUCT URLS

DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator - <https://github.com/instipod/DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-201 - Information Exposure Through Sent Data

##### DETAILS

DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator is an authentication solution for Keycloak leveraging Duo’s Java Universal Prompt SDK to prompt users for Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) within the context of a Keycloak login process.

A completely unaware user can inadvertently expose their own credentials to the duosecurity.com site simply by logging into a Keycloak server that utilizes the DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator plugin.
The new Keycloak extension for Duo, when detecting that initial authentication has succeeded with Keycloak, redirects your browser to the configured duosecurity.com endpoint. This is expected. Unfortunately it performs this redirection via `Response.temporaryRedirect`.

Vulnerable code `line 284`:

```
Line 282        try {
Line 283            String startingUrl = duoClient.createAuthUrl(username, loginState);
Line 284            authenticationFlowContext.challenge(Response.temporaryRedirect(new URI(startingUrl)).build());
Line 285        } catch (Exception exception) {
Line 286            if (authConfig.getConfig().getOrDefault(DuoUniversalAuthenticatorFactory.DUO_FAIL_SAFE, "true").equalsIgnoreCase("false")) {
Line 287                // fail secure, deny login
Line 288                authenticationFlowContext.failure(AuthenticationFlowError.INVALID_CREDENTIALS);
Line 289            } else {
Line 290                authenticationFlowContext.success();
Line 291            }
Line 292        }
Line 293    }

```

`Response.temporaryRedirect` uses HTTP code 307. This is problematic because 307 instructs the browser to visit the new location *using the same METHOD and body parameters as the original request*. This means that when your browser redirects to duosecurity.com it sends your username and password to Duo as well, as a POST with your username/password was the request that caused the 307 redirect.
Anyone using this extension sends their usernames/passwords to Duo every time they authenticate to their Keycloak instance and perform MFA. This behavior is present in all versions of the “DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator” extension.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Fixed in version 1.0.8, see https://github.com/instipod/DuoUniversalKeycloakAuthenticator/releases/tag/1.0.8

##### TIMELINE

2023-12-20 - Initial Vendor Contact

2023-12-21 - Vendor Disclosure

2023-12-23 - Public Release

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
