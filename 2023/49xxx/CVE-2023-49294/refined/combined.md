```
When using AMI GetConfig, it was possible to access files outside of the
Asterisk configuration directory by using filenames with ".." and "./"
even while live_dangerously was not enabled. This change resolves the
full path and ensures we are still in the configuration directory before
attempting to access the file.

Package        : asterisk
Version        : 1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-37457 CVE-2023-38703 CVE-2023-49294 CVE-2023-49786
Debian Bug     : 1059303 1059032 1059033

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, an Open
Source Private Branch Exchange.

CVE-2023-37457

    The 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed
    the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing
    so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally
    exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based
    on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used
    the vulnerability does not occur.

CVE-2023-38703

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
    C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a
    higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media
    transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not
    synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce a
    use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have
    SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media
    transport other than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from
    unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory
    corruption.

CVE-2023-49294

    It is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously`
    option is not enabled.

CVE-2023-49786

   Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello
   handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media
   setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP
   encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to
   a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that
   rely on DTLS-SRTP.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

For the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

It is possible to read any arbitrary file via AMI even when the live\_dangerously is not enabled.

### Details

CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

<https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal>

<https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/master/main/manager.c#L3757>

### PoC

cp /config/asterisk/default/http.conf /

This is denied as expected:

```

Filename: /http.conf
ActionID: 09235013

Response: Error
ActionID: 09235013
Message: File requires escalated priveledges

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
