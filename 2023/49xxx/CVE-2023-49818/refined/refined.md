- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to a Broken Access Control issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically a missing check for authorization, authentication, or nonce tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges and can be an unauthenticated user.
