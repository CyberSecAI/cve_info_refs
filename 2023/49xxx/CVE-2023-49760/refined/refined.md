- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPsoonOnlinePage WordPress plugin, versions 1.9 and earlier, lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated as the user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into initiating it. This could be achieved through social engineering, such as by sending a crafted email with a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user to initiate the malicious request. The attacker does not require any authentication.
