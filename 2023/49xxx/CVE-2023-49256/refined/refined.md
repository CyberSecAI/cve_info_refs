Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-49256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Hongdian H8951-4G-ESP router software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The router uses a static, hardcoded key for encrypting sensitive information in configuration backups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Configuration Backup Download:** An attacker can download the router's configuration backup without needing to authenticate.
- **Decryption of Passwords:** The hardcoded key allows an attacker to decrypt the passwords contained within the downloaded configuration backup.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can directly download the configuration backup file without authentication
- Using the hardcoded key, an attacker can decrypt the passwords within the configuration backup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the router in order to download the configuration backup.
- No authentication is required to download the configuration backup.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability, along with others, was addressed by the vendor in build 2310271149.
- The vulnerability report was made to CERT Polska.
