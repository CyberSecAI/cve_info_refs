The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49381.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF protection in the `/admin/div/update` endpoint of JFinalcms v5.0.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, specifically modifying custom table data, without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint.  When a logged-in user visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, and the attackerâ€™s request is executed by the server as if it came from the legitimate user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to visit the malicious page. This could be through email phishing, social media posts, or compromised websites. The attacker also needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameters.
