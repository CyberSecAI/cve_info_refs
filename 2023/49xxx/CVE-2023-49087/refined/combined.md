# Validation of SignedInfo

Moderate

[tvdijen](/tvdijen)
published
GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r
Nov 27, 2023

## Package

simplesamlphp/saml2
(PHP)

## Affected versions

5.0.0-alpha.12

## Patched versions

5.0.0-alpha.13

simplesamlphp/xml-security
(PHP)

1.6.11

1.6.12

## Description

Validation of an XML Signature requires verification that the hash value of the related XML-document (after any

optional transformations and/or normalizations) matches a specific DigestValue-value, but also that the cryptografic

signature on the SignedInfo-tree (the one that contains the DigestValue) verifies and matches a trusted public key.

Within the simpleSAMLphp/xml-security library (<https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security>), the hash is being

validated using SignedElementTrait::validateReference, and the signature is being verified in

SignedElementTrait::verifyInternal

<https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/blob/master/src/XML/SignedElementTrait.php>:

[![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841045/285817284-a7b7b3b4-768a-46e8-a34b-61790b6e23a5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841045/285817284-a7b7b3b4-768a-46e8-a34b-61790b6e23a5.png)

What stands out is that the signature is being calculated over the canonical version of the SignedInfo-tree. The validateReference

method, however, uses the original non-canonicalized version of SignedInfo.

### Impact

If an attacker somehow (i.e. by exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be potentially be possible to forge the signature. No possibilities to exploit this were found during the investigation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N
