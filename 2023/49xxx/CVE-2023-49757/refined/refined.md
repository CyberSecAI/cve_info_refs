Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a "Broken Access Control" issue. This means that the Awesome Support plugin <= 6.1.10 is missing proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in some functions. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms. This allows for unauthorized actions to be performed by lower-privileged users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The specific impact will vary, but it could potentially allow an unprivileged user (subscriber) to perform privileged actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a function lacking sufficient authorization or authentication checks, which can be triggered by a subscriber.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site.
