- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically a missing check in a function which leads to unprivileged users executing privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, can execute actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact will vary depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by directly interacting with the vulnerable function due to the absence of sufficient access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber or have lower level privileges and have knowledge of the vulnerable function.
