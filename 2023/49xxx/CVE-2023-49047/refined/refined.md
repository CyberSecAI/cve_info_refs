Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   A stack buffer overflow exists within the `formSetDeviceName` function of the Tenda AX1803 router's firmware.
*   The `devName` parameter is not properly validated for size before being copied to a stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The router crashes when the overflow occurs.
*   Potentially, the vulnerability could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if further exploited, but the provided details only mention a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint.
*   The `devName` parameter in the POST request is used to provide the overly large input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same network as the router or having access through a vulnerability in the router's internet-facing interface.
*  The attacker needs to know the cookie to be able to authenticate the request (e.g. `password=002a77b3f3cdec7e900d0be9a911fb6bsiqtgb`).

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable firmware version is `v1.0.0.1`.
* The `mac` parameter is also included in the request but doesn't appear to be directly related to the vulnerability.
* The provided POC demonstrates how to crash the router by providing a long string to `devName`.
