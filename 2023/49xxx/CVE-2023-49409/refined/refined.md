Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Tenda AX3 router handles HTTP requests to the `/goform/telnet` route. Specifically, the router doesn't properly sanitize input, leading to the potential injection of shell metacharacters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection via shell metacharacters in the HTTP request. The router executes unsanitized input, leading to arbitrary command execution on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router, gaining full control over the device.
- **Device Compromise:** This could lead to a complete compromise of the router, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, intercept traffic, or use the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/telnet` route.
- **Shell Metacharacters:** The attacker leverages shell metacharacters to inject and execute their commands within this HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This likely requires being on the same network as the router or having access through a forwarded port.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a basic HTTP GET request.
- **Command Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to insert shell metacharacters to execute commands.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Firmware:** Tenda AX3 V16.03.12.11 is confirmed vulnerable.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided content includes a `curl` command example that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability: `curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1/goform/telnet`
- The provided images show the successful exploitation of the vulnerability, demonstrating the ability to execute commands on the router's shell.
