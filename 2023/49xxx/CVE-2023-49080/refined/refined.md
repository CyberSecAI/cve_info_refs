Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unhandled errors in API requests were including traceback information in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Inclusion of traceback information in error responses, which could reveal internal path information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Disclosure of internal path information.
-  The content states that the revealed paths are not considered particularly sensitive, as the requesting user has arbitrary execution permissions already.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Triggering an unhandled error within an API request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker must be an authenticated user, implying they already have some level of access to the system.
- The content also suggests that the attacker already has arbitrary execution permissions, implying significant system access.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves removing the traceback information from JSON error responses. For backward compatibility the "traceback" field is still present but always empty.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Low" severity.
