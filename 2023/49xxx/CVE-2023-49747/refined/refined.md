- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Guest Author plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject scripts, potentially leading to redirects, displaying advertisements, or other harmful HTML content, which is then executed when users visit the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts through input fields, which are then displayed to other users. The specific input location is not mentioned.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject content into the vulnerable plugin and have it rendered on the website. The 'Author' privilege is noted, which may be a required capability.
