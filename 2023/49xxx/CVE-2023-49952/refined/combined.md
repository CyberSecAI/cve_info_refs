# Security: mastodon/mastodon

## Security

  [Report a vulnerability](/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/new)

### SECURITY.md

# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in Mastodon (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can either:

* open a [GitHub security issue on the Mastodon project](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/new)
* reach us at security@joinmastodon.org

You should *not* report such issues on public GitHub issues or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Mastodon's users to increased risk.

## Scope

A "vulnerability in Mastodon" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| 4.3.x | Yes |
| 4.2.x | Yes |
| 4.1.x | Until 2025-04-08 |
| < 4.1 | No |

# Bypassing rate limiting with X-Forwarded-For header

Moderate

[renchap](/renchap)
published
GHSA-c2r5-cfqr-c553
May 30, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 4.2.8, <= 4.1.16

## Patched versions

4.2.9, 4.1.17

## Description

### Summary

Rate limiting is applied to most API endpoints by default. However, in some incorrect configurations, the measure can be circumvented by setting the request header `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`.

### Details

Provided they manage to directly connect to `puma`, an attacker can spoof their IP address by setting the `X-Forwarded-For` or `Client-Ip` HTTP header, and use that to bypass most rate-limiting.

Indeed, Rails' `RemoteIp` middleware, as used in Mastodon, will always trust the last (closest) `X-Forwarded-For` or `Client-Ip` header even if it comes from an untrusted source.

Furthermore, most of Mastodon's rate-limiting is done through `rack-attack` and explicitly exempting 127.0.0.1 from those, allowing an attacker to bypass them if they manage to spoof their IP address.

### Impact

By bypassing the rate limiting measure, all other protective measures based on it (such as brute force detection) are also rendered ineffective.

An attacker could, for example, try to guess valid usernames and corresponding passwords in an automated fashion.

In addition, users could use the X-Forwarded-For header to pretend to connect from a different IP address (in the associated log entry).

However, the impact is limited by the fact that the attacker needs to be able to provide its own `X-Forwarded-For` or `Client-Ip` header without any being appended by a remote-proxy, effectively requiring the Mastodon server to be misconfigured.

Note

This security issue has been found by [mgm security partners](https://www.mgm-sp.com/), during a security audit commissioned by the [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
