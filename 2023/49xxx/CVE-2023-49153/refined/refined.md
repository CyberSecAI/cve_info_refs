  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Add to Cart Text Changer and Customize Button, Add Custom Icon plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when executed by an authenticated user, performs actions on their behalf without their consent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or loading a malicious page) that triggers the forged request."
