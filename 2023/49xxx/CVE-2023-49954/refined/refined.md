- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The 3CX CRM integration uses unsanitized user input in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Placeholders in the SQL templates are replaced with user-provided data without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could include access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - WebClient (authenticated): Performing a contact search with a maliciously crafted search string.
    - LiveChat API (unauthenticated): Sending a specially crafted email address via the GET request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: 
   - For the WebClient attack vector, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
   - For the LiveChat API, no authentication is required.
