- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "Affiliate Booster â€“ Pros & Cons, Notice, and CTA Blocks for Affiliates" versions 3.0.5 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts would vary based on the actions exposed by the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, performs an unintended action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
