With simplicity and ease of use in mind, the RuckusZoneDirector 1200 is purpose-built to address the gap between standalone, feature-deficient access points (APs) that must be individually managed and the costly, complex high-end enterprise systems that are overkill for most small business environments.

The Ruckus ZoneDirector 1200 can be deployed and operated by non-wireless experts and installed quickly and easily. Any organization with limited IT staff and budget can create a robust and secure multimedia WLAN in a matter of minutes.

This controller is focused on small to medium enterprise business, which scales up to 150 AP’s, 4,000 client devices, and 256 WLANs.  The ZD 1200 works with the ZoneFlex AP’s to deliver a highly reliable and easy to manage Wi-Fi network. The pay as you grow licensing system allows you to start with a standard license for 5 AP’s and grow to a maximum of 150 AP’s with a granularity of one AP license.
