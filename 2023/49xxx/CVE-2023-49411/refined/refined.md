Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists within the `formDeleteMeshNode` function of the `httpd` service, specifically in the `/bin` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack Overflow: The vulnerability occurs because the `formDeleteMeshNode` function does not properly validate the size of the input it receives which allows an attacker to write data beyond the buffer allocated on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Sending crafted packets, as demonstrated in the provided Python exploit, causes the router to crash.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: While the provided information primarily details a DoS attack, stack overflows can often lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can overwrite return addresses and control the execution flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/module` URL, specifically targeting the `deleteMesh` functionality.
- Malicious input within JSON:  The exploit uses a crafted JSON payload, specifically in the "mac" field, to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
- Ability to craft a malicious HTTP request including a specific JSON payload.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable function: `formDeleteMeshNode`
- Vulnerable binary: `httpd` located in `/bin`
- Vulnerable URL: `/goform/module` with parameters targeting `deleteMesh`
- The exploit provided demonstrates how to overflow the stack by sending a long string of 'b' characters in the "mac" field of the JSON payload, followed by a return address.
- The vulnerability is located in Tenda W30E firmware version V16.01.0.12(4843)
- The PoC exploit uses `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, although the body is a JSON.
