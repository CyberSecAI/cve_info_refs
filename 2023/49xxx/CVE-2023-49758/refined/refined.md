- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions they are not supposed to. Specific impact varies depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: A missing authorization check allows an attacker to bypass access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user with the Subscriber role.
