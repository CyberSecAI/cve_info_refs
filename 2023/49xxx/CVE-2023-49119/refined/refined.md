Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when processing `img` tags within the GROWI application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within `img` tags, allowing malicious scripts to be embedded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the web browser of any user who views a page containing the malicious `img` tag.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the user, including displaying fake pages or stealing cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted `img` tags:** An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code within an `img` tag and store it within the GROWI application. When a user views a page containing the crafted `img` tag, the script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create or edit content within the GROWI application. This allows them to inject the malicious `img` tag.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires another user to view the page containing the maliciously crafted content.
