- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to uninitialized pointer access while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PAR file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file. The attacker requires local access to the machine.
