- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A `where_in` JINJA macro in Apache Superset allows users to specify a quote, which can be exploited for SQL injection when combined with a crafted SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input within the `where_in` JINJA macro.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on database permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted SQL statement passed through the vulnerable `where_in` JINJA macro within the Apache Superset application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the input that reaches the vulnerable `where_in` JINJA macro. The specific user privileges required to trigger the vulnerability are not detailed in the text.
