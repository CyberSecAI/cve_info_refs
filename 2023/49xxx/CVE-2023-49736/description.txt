A where_in JINJA macro allows users to specify a quote, which combined with a carefully crafted statement would allow for SQL injection in Apache Superset.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 2.1.2, from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.2, which fixes the issue.
