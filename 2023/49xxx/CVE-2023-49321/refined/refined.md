- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Processing certain fuzzed files takes longer to scan, causing the scanner to hang.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability due to inefficient processing of specific fuzzed files during scanning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to the scanner hanging, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker by providing a specially crafted, fuzzed file for scanning.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious file to the vulnerable product for scanning to trigger the denial-of-service.
