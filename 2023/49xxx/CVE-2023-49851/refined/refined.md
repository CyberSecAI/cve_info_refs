- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Square Thumbnails WordPress plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The vulnerability lies in the plugin's failure to enforce proper access control mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability to execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin function, which can be triggered by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
