Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2023-49075**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by an incorrect implementation in `PimcoreUserTwoFactorCondition.php` which disabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for all non-admin security firewalls. The code was intended to enable 2FA for non-admin firewalls, but a logic error resulted in the opposite behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the disabling of 2FA for non-admin firewalls. This bypasses the expected security measures, leaving the system vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated user can access the system without needing to provide 2FA credentials, effectively bypassing the intended additional layer of security. This could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, tampering, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, requiring an attacker to have network access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability and must target a non-admin firewall. They also need to be able to interact with the login page (user interaction required) as part of the authentication process. The attacker needs to have a high level of privileges (Privileges required: High) because they must be an authenticated user with access to the system.
