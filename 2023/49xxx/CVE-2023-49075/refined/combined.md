### @dvesh3 **[dvesh3](/dvesh3)** commented [Nov 10, 2023](#issue-1987180107)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Setup 2FA for non admin firewall (e.g. simple setup email <https://symfony.com/bundles/SchebTwoFactorBundle/6.x/providers/email.html#how-authentication-works>)
2. login
3. No 2FA executed

Sorry, something went wrong.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
