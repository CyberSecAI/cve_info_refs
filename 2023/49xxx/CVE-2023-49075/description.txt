The Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. `AdminBundle\Security\PimcoreUserTwoFactorCondition` introduced in v11 disable the two factor authentication for all non-admin security firewalls. An authenticated user can access the system without having to provide the two factor credentials. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.2.
