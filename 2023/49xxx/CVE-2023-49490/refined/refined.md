Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-49490 (Based on the content, this is likely the vulnerability being discussed, even if not explicitly stated)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `dr_form_search_hidden` function in `dayrui/Fcms/Core/Helper.php`. This function directly concatenates the value of the 's' parameter from the GET request into a hidden input field without any sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. Because the `s` parameter is directly injected into the HTML, a malicious user can inject JavaScript code into this parameter, which will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Theft:** The provided exploit example demonstrates the ability to steal cookies via the XSS vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user sessions and potentially compromise accounts.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can leverage the XSS vulnerability to perform various malicious actions such as:
    *   Redirecting users to phishing pages
    *   Modifying the content of the page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the 's' parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker tricks a user, typically an administrator, into clicking the malicious link.
    * The provided example shows how an administrator accessing the malicious URL would be vulnerable.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `s` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL containing the malicious payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to induce the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `dr_form_search_hidden` function in the `dayrui/Fcms/Core/Helper.php` file, specifically between lines 2039 and 2053.
*   The exploit example is provided:
    ```
    http://192.168.160.132:5533/admin.php?c=notice&date_form=1906-10-28&date_to=1906-10-28&field=op_username&keyword=1&m=my_index&s=1%22%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/ScRiPt%3E&submit=
    ```

In summary, this content provides a clear description of a reflected XSS vulnerability in XunRuiCMS, specifically within the `dr_form_search_hidden` function, where it lacks proper sanitization of the `s` parameter. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted URL and potentially steal user cookies.
