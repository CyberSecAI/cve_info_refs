Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the RuoYi application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `ancestors` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries. This is demonstrated with the example of extracting the database user.
*   **Potential for Full Database Compromise:**  Using tools like `sqlmap`, an attacker could potentially gain complete access to the database, modify data, or cause other forms of damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/system/dept/edit`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   No authentication or special privileges are explicitly mentioned as required to exploit this vulnerability, although access to the `/system/dept/edit` endpoint is needed.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability is located within the `/system/dept/edit` component of the RuoYi application.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `ancestors` parameter is directly injected into the SQL query without proper sanitization, specifically within a `where dept_id in (${ancestors})` clause.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A sample PoC is provided to demonstrate the injection: `DeptName= 1&deptid =100&ParentId=12&Status= 0&ordernum =1&ancestors=0)or(extractvalue(1,concat((select user())))); #`
*   **Affected Versions:** RuoYi up to version 4.6 is affected.
*   **SQL Injection Point:** The injection point is within the SQL query executed during the update operation, specifically in the `where` clause, as shown by the provided example.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    1.  The attacker identifies the `/system/dept/edit` route.
    2.  The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to this route, embedding SQL injection payload in the `ancestors` parameter.
    3.  The application executes the crafted SQL query leading to information disclosure.
    4.  The attacker uses a tool like `sqlmap` to exploit further and retrieve more database information.
