### **[jnovikov](/jnovikov)** commented [Oct 28, 2023](/jnovikov/184afb593d9c2114d77f508e0ccd508e?permalink_comment_id=4742311#gistcomment-4742311)

Current aiohttp version (3.8.6) is vulnerable to CRLF injection if attacker can control the HTTP version specified for the request.

If the attacker can specify custom array (from JSON for example), validation won't be triggered and attacker would be able to change the request (headers).

This can help with the exploitation of various SSRF vulnerabilites.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# ClientSession is vulnerable to CRLF injection via version

Low

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-q3qx-c6g2-7pw2
Nov 26, 2023

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.9.0

## Patched versions

3.9.0

## Description

### Summary

Improper validation make it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. to insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP version.

### Details

The vulnerability only occurs if the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request (including its type).

For example if an unvalidated JSON value is used as a version and the attacker is then able to pass an array as the `version` parameter.

Furthermore, the vulnerability only occurs when the `Connection` header is passed to the `headers` parameter.

At this point, the library will use the parsed value to create the request. If a list is passed, then it bypasses validation and it is possible to perform CRLF injection.

### PoC

The POC below shows an example of providing an unvalidated array as a version:

<https://gist.github.com/jnovikov/184afb593d9c2114d77f508e0ccd508e>

### Impact

CRLF injection leading to Request Smuggling.

### Workaround

If these specific conditions are met and you are unable to upgrade, then validate the user input to the `version` parameter to ensure it is a `str`.

Patch: <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/7835/files>

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-49081

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
