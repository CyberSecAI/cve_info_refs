Before DolphinScheduler version 3.1.0, the login user could delete UDF function in the resource center unauthorized (which almost used in sql task), with unauthorized access vulnerability (IDOR), but after version 3.1.0 we fixed this issue. We mark this cve as moderate level because it still requires user login to operate, please upgrade to version 3.1.0 to avoid this vulnerability
