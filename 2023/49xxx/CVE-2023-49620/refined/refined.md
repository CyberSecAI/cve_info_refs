Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in Apache DolphinScheduler versions prior to 3.1.0. Specifically, authenticated users could delete User Defined Functions (UDFs) within the resource center, even if they lacked the necessary permissions. This is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system directly uses user-provided IDs for UDF deletion without verifying if the user is authorized to perform the action on the specific resource.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The application fails to adequately check user permissions before allowing deletion of UDFs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker who is a logged-in user can delete UDFs that they are not authorized to manage, potentially disrupting the application's functionality. Since UDFs are often used in SQL tasks, this could lead to broken workflows and data processing issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of Apache DolphinScheduler.
- An authenticated user needs to access the resource center and attempt to delete UDFs for which they lack proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a valid user of the Apache DolphinScheduler application.
- The attacker needs to be logged in to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity because it requires user login.
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in version 3.1.0 of Apache DolphinScheduler.
- The GitHub pull request #10307, referenced in the provided text, contains the fix for this vulnerability, which involves restructuring permissions for the resource center.
