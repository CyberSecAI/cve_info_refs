**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue within the "Login With Ajax" WordPress plugin. This means that a function within the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the **lack of proper access control**. This allows unprivileged users (specifically, users with the "Subscriber" role) to potentially execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as "moderately dangerous" and "expected to become exploited." The specific impact is not detailed in the provided text. The general description of this vulnerability type on the page mentions an unprivileged user executing a higher privileged action.
