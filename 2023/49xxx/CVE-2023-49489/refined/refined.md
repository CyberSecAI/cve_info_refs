The provided content describes a reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in KodExplorer 4.51.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way KodExplorer handles the `APP_HOST` cookie value within the `config/i18n/en/main.php` file. Specifically, the application directly uses the cookie's content within a string format operation (`%s`) without proper sanitization or entity encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflective XSS:** The application reflects the unsanitized cookie value back to the user in the response page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or encode the `APP_HOST` cookie before using it in the page's context, making it vulnerable to script injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser by manipulating the `APP_HOST` cookie.
- This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `APP_HOST` cookie value. This can be achieved through various means including:
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks
  - Cross-site request forgery
  - By exploiting another vulnerability that allows cookie manipulation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the victim's cookie or trick the user into visiting a malicious page that sets the `APP_HOST` cookie with malicious content before accessing a vulnerable page. The exploit requires an ability to modify the cookie value either directly or by an indirect method that sets the cookie, making the attack complex.
