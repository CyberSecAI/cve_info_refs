- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses the `Image::make()` function without validating the provided URL parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external services, potentially leading to information disclosure, internal network scanning, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user uploads an image by URL to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected application.
