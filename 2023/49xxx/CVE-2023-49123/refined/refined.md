- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow during the parsing of specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process, potentially leading to a crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious PAR file using the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted PAR file.
