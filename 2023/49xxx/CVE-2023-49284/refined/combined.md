Subject: CVE-2023-49284: fish command substitution output can trigger shell
 expansion

<https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/security/advisories/GHSA-2j9r-pm96-wp4f>
reports:

Package: fish-shell
Affected versions: < 3.6.2
Patched versions: 3.6.2
CVSS: 3.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L)
CVE ID: CVE-2023-49284

Impact:

fish shell uses certain Unicode non-characters internally for marking wildcards
and expansions. It will incorrectly allow these markers to be read on command
substitution output, rather than transforming them into a safe internal
representation.

While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input (for example, echo
\UFDD2HOME has the same output as echo $HOME), this may become a minor security
problem if the output is being fed from an external program into a command
substitution where this output may not be expected.

Consider the following:

In foo.py:

print("\ufdd2HOME") # Perhaps this value is retrieved from a database or
external source

At the shell:

 > echo $(python3 foo.py)
/home/fishuser

This design flaw was introduced in very early versions of fish, predating the
version control system, and is thought to be present in every version of fish
released in the last 15 years or more, although with different characters.

Code execution does not appear to be possible, but denial of service (through
large brace expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion) is
potentially possible under certain circumstances.

Patches:

fish shell 3.6.2 has been released to correct this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
