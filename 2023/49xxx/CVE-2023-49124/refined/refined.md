- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure during the parsing of specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file. No special privileges are required and user interaction is needed for successful exploitation.
