- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file using the vulnerable Solid Edge application. The attacker has to prepare the crafted PAR file, but does not require any special privileges or network access to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required (opening the crafted file).
