# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hi [@coudot](https://github.com/coudot) , All,  I have found a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to hijack SMS codes to an arbitrary phone number. This could lead to any user's passwords being changed without any notification. I am worried that if the PoC appears on GitHub it could be exploited; could you please provide me with an e-mail address on which to continue responsible disclosure?  Thank you and Regards |
