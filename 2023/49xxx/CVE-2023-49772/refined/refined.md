- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Genesis Simple Love Plugin, versions 2.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection. This occurs when the application unserializes user-controlled data, which allows an attacker to instantiate arbitrary PHP objects and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection. The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of serialized PHP objects, which, when deserialized, can lead to the instantiation of arbitrary PHP classes and potentially execute code if a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain exists.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and other attacks, depending on the available POP chain and application context.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-controlled data which is then deserialized by the vulnerable plugin. This could potentially be achieved through various input fields, query parameters, or other data sources handled by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication, suggesting the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users. The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious serialized PHP object to the vulnerable plugin.
