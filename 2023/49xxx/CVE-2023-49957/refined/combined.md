| **Issue Description**: The current implementation of the OCPP server does not adhere to the specified behavior in the OCPP documentation regarding concurrent transactions. The documentation states that if an `idTag` is already involved in an active transaction, any attempt to initiate a new transaction with the same `idTag` should result in an `AuthorizationStatus` of `ConcurrentTx`. However, I've observed two issues:   1. The server allows initiation of multiple transactions using the same `idTag` without the `ConcurrentTx` status. 2. A `StopTransaction` message with a random `transactionId` can stop the current transaction.   **Steps to Reproduce**:   1. Send a `StartTransaction` message using a specific `idTag`. 2. While the transaction is active, send another `StartTransaction` message with the same `idTag`. 3. Observe that the server does not return an `AuthorizationStatus` of `ConcurrentTx`. 4. Send a `StopTransaction` message with a random `transactionId`. 5. Note that the server stops the most recent transaction.   **Expected Behavior**: In compliance with the OCPP specification, the server should not allow a new transaction to start with an `idTag` that is already in use for an ongoing transaction. The server should issue an `AuthorizationStatus` of `ConcurrentTx`.  **Actual Behavior**: Multiple transactions are allowed for the same `idTag` without returning a `ConcurrentTx` status, and transactions can be stopped using random `transactionIds`.  **Potential Impact**: This could cause a critical error in transaction management and billing processes, affecting operational integrity.  **Suggested Solution**:   * Update the server logic to return an `AuthorizationStatus` of `ConcurrentTx` for `StartTransaction` requests that involve an `idTag` in an ongoing transaction. * Validate `transactionId` in `StopTransaction` requests to ensure the correct transaction is being stopped.   Best regards, Gaetano Coppoletta |

| You are correct. The specification describes the status "ConcurrentTx" this way. But does it make sense in real life? Imagine you've got two cars in your family and want to charge both in parallel on the same account/token? Why should that be rejected? I've added a configuration switch (appsettings.json) to enable this behavior (next version 1.3.0). It might make more sense to add a corresponding setting to the charge tags. So it can be enabled/disabled individually. Maybe in a later version :-) |

| Please check V1.3.0. There is an new switch in the appsettings file. |
