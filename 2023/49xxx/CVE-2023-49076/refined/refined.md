Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-49076

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when creating a new customer in the Pimcore Customer Data Framework. The `/admin/customermanagementframework/customers/new` endpoint was accessible via a GET request without any CSRF token validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The application's lack of CSRF protection on the new customer creation endpoint allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Unprotected GET request:** The customer creation endpoint was vulnerable because it accepted a GET request which is not secure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can create new customers within the Pimcore application without the knowledge or consent of the legitimate user.
- This can affect the integrity of the customer database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can create a malicious webpage that contains an image tag that sends the vulnerable GET request to the target application, e.g., via an `<img>` tag. When a logged-in administrator visits this malicious page, the browser will automatically send the request, creating a new customer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated administrator into visiting the malicious webpage while they are logged into the Pimcore application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided patch (commit `ef7414415cfa64189b8433eff0aa2a9b537a89f7`) addresses the issue by:
    - Changing the route for new customer creation to accept only POST requests.
    - Adding a CSRF token validation to the new customer creation endpoint.
    - Modifying the javascript to send a POST request with the required token.
- The vulnerability was found in versions prior to 4.0.5 of the `pimcore/customer-data-framework` package.
- The exploit PoC includes an HTML page with an `<img>` tag to trigger the vulnerable request.
