Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Google Compute Engine Plugin for Jenkins, in versions 4.550.vb_327fca_3db_11 and earlier, does not correctly perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing access to certain HTTP endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker with the global Item/Configure permission, but lacking Item/Configure permission on specific jobs, can exploit this to:

*   **Enumerate System-Scoped Credentials IDs:** The attacker can discover the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins, which could then be used to capture the actual credentials using another vulnerability.
*   **Access Google Cloud Platform:** The attacker can connect to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using attacker-specified credential IDs. This allows them to obtain information about existing projects, even without proper permissions on those projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints without proper permission checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have global Item/Configure permission within Jenkins.
*   The attacker does not require Item/Configure permission on any particular job.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is specific to the Google Compute Engine Plugin.
* The advisory includes mitigation of the vulnerability by requiring the Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints in version 4.551.v5a_4dc98f6962 of the plugin.
* The severity of the issue is classified as Medium.
