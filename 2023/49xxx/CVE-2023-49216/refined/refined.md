The provided content mentions that a number of vulnerabilities were fixed. Specifically, it mentions:

- **Reflected XSS in filter**
- **Stored XSS in profile**
- **Template Injection in chat**

These vulnerabilities were reportedly fixed in an update.

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- Reflected XSS: The application's filter functionality did not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that are reflected back to the user.
- Stored XSS: The user profile functionality allowed the storage of malicious scripts which are then executed when other users view the profile.
- Template Injection: The chat feature allowed the injection of code within the template engine, potentially allowing for server-side execution of attacker-controlled code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, both reflected and stored.
- Template injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- XSS: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web page.
- Template injection: An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure.

**Attack vectors**:
- XSS: Via manipulating filter parameters and user profiles.
- Template Injection: Via the chat feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- XSS: The attacker needs the ability to manipulate filter parameters (reflected) and user profile information (stored).
- Template Injection:  The attacker needs the ability to send specific messages via the chat feature.
