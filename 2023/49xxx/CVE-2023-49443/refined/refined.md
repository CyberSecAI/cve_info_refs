Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of verification codes in the DoraCMS backend login process. The application allows the reuse of a verification code multiple times.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Verification Code Reuse:** The primary vulnerability is that the verification code does not expire or is not invalidated after a single use, allowing it to be used repeatedly.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There's no evidence of rate limiting or lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts, which makes brute-force attacks feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can repeatedly try different passwords using the same verification code. This makes brute-forcing weak passwords much easier.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successfully brute-forcing the password allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the DoraCMS backend.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the DoraCMS backend login page.
- **Login Page:** The vulnerability is exploited through the standard login page by manipulating login requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the DoraCMS backend login page over the network.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to capture and modify login requests using tools like Burp Suite.
- **Brute-forcing tools**: The attacker needs tools to automate password guessing like Burp Suite Intruder.
- **User Account**: The attacker must have a valid username to target the brute-force attack.

**Additional Notes**
- The content provides detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability including screenshots, showing that the verification code can be reused with different passwords.
- The content specifies the affected version (DoraCMS 2.1.8)
