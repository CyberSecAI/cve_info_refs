- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the fact that when the forgot password functionality is used with an incorrectly configured SMTP setup (SMTP configured but not responding), the system displays different error messages depending on whether the user exists or not.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User enumeration is possible via the password reset functionality due to different error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use the different error messages to determine if a particular user is registered on the system, potentially leading to further targeted attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is conducted remotely over the network using the forgot password functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the application and attempt to use the forgot password feature for potential usernames. No prior privileges or user interaction is needed.
