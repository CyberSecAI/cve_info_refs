# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# Apache NiFi Security

Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. Project Management Committee members will
collaborate and respond to potential vulnerabilities, providing an assessment of the concern and a plan of action to
remediate verified issues.

## Reporting Policy

Please read the [Apache Project Security for Committers](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html)
policy for general guidelines applicable disclosure of security issues for Apache Software Foundation projects.

Do not perform the following actions after discovering a potential security concern:

* Open a Jira disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project mailing lists disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project Slack instance disclosing a security vulnerability to the public

## Reporting Guidelines

Configuring dangerous operating system commands or custom scripts is not a project security vulnerability.
Authenticated and authorized users are responsible for the security of operating system commands and custom
code.

Apache NiFi provides a framework for developing processing pipelines using standard and custom
components. The framework supports configurable permissions that enable authorized users to execute code
using several standard components. Components such as ExecuteProcess and ExecuteStreamCommand support
running operating system commands, while other scripted components support executing custom code using
different programming languages. Configuring these components with untrusted commands or arguments is
contrary to best practices, but it does not constitute of security issue for remediation.

## Reporting Process

* Notify the project on initial discovery of a potential security vulnerability
* Provide a reasonable amount of time for an initial assessment and remediation plan
* Limit interaction to accounts under direct control or accounts with explicit permission of the owner
* Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services
* Avoid spamming, social engineering, and methods to manipulate project members

## Reporting Methods

* Security Mailing List: security@nifi.apache.org
  + Members of the Project Management Committee monitor this private mailing list and respond to disclosures

## Severity Ratings

Severity ratings represent the determination of project members based on an evaluation of
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) calculations.

* Critical: Arbitrary code execution from a remote attacker
* High: Compromise of integrity or availability through resource exhaustion
* Medium: Requires special configuration settings and significant mitigations are available
* Low: Minimal impact and significant difficulty of exploitation

# Published Vulnerabilities

The following announcements include published vulnerabilities that apply directly to Apache NiFi components.

### CVE-2024-56512

* Title: Missing Complete Authorization for Parameter and Service References
* Published: 2024-12-27
* Severity: Low
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 2.0.0
* Fixed Versions: 2.1.0
* Reporter: Matt Gilman
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56512)
  + NVD Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56512)
  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13976)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9535](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9535)

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced
Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups. Creating a new Process Group
can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values,
the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound
Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group. Creating
a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did
not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create
Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized. This vulnerability is limited in scope to
authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with
component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes
authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.

### CVE-2024-52067

* Title: Potential Insertion of Sensitive Parameter Values in Debug Log
* Published: 2024-11-20
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.16.0 to 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M4
* Fixed Versions: 1.28.1 and 2.0.0
* Reporter: David Handermann
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-52067](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52067)
  + NVD Record: [CVE-2024-52067](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52067)
  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13971](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13971)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9489](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9489)

Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values
during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging
for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log.
Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration.
Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values.
Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.

### CVE-2024-45477

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Parameter Description
* Published: 2024-10-28
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 1.27.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M3
* Fixed Versions: 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M4
* Reporter: Muhammad Hazim Bin Nor Aizi
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-45477](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45477)
  + NVD Record: [CVE-2024-45477](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45477)
  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13675)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9195](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9195)

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 1.27.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M3 support a description field for Parameters in a Parameter Context
configuration that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An authenticated user, authorized to configure a Parameter Context,
can enter arbitrary JavaScript code, which the client browser will execute within the session context of the authenticated user.
Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.28.0 or 2.0.0-M4 is the recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2024-37389

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Parameter Context Description
* Published: 2024-07-08
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 1.26.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M3
* Fixed Versions: 1.27.0 and 2.0.0-M4

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 1.26.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M3 support a description field in the Parameter Context
configuration that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An authenticated user, authorized to configure a Parameter
Context, can enter arbitrary JavaScript code, which the client browser will execute within the session context of the
authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.27.0 or 2.0.0-M4 is the recommended mitigation.

Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for
retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code
execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting
configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring
Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache
NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.

The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not
neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS
platforms. The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires
ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection
also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with
authorization to modify access policies to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with
authorization to read user groups to execute the command. NiFi and NiFi Registry version 1.16.3 has completely removed
the shell commands from the ShellUserGroupProvider that received user arguments.

Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default
configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing
formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with
default property values: EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml. Apache NiFi flow configurations that include
these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External
Entity references. Upgrading to NiFi 1.16.1 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these
processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.

When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers
configuration to the operating system temporary directory. The Login Identity Providers configuration file contains the
username and a bcrypt hash of the configured password. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has
global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which
significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. Bcrypt is a password-hashing algorithm that incorporates a
random salt and a specified cost factor, designed to maintain resistance to brute-force attacks. Use of the bcrypt
algorithm minimizes the impact of disclosing the single-user credentials stored in Login Identity Providers. NiFi 1.16.0
includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system
temporary directory.

The NiFi download token (one-time password) mechanism used a fixed cache size and did not authenticate a request to
create a download token, only when attempting to use the token to access the content. An unauthenticated user could
repeatedly request download tokens, preventing legitimate users from requesting download tokens. NiFi 1.12.0 disabled
anonymous authentication, implemented a multi-indexed cache, and limited token creation requests to
one concurrent request per user. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.12.0.

The NiFi UI and API were protected by mandating TLS v1.2, as well as listening connections established by processors
like ListenHTTP and HandleHttpRequest. However intra-cluster communication such as cluster request replication,
Site-to-Site, and load balanced queues continued to support TLS 1.0 or 1.1. NiFI 1.12.0 refactored disparate internal
SSL and TLS code, reducing exposure for extension and framework developers to low-level primitives. NiFi 1.12. also
added support for TLS v1.3 on supporting JVMs. This version restricted all incoming TLS communications to TLS
1.2 or higher. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.12.0.

When updating a Process Group via the API, the response to the request includes all of its contents (at the top most
level, not recursively). The response included details about processors and controller services which the user may not
have had read access to. Requests to update or remove the process group will no longer return the contents of the
process group in the response in Apache NiFi 1.10.0. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.10.0.

The X-Frame-Options headers were applied inconsistently on some HTTP responses, resulting in duplicate or missing
security headers. Some browsers would interpret these results incorrectly, allowing clickjacking attacks. NiFi 1.8.0
consistently applies the security headers including X-Frame-Options. Users running a prior release should upgrade to
1.8.0.

The message-page.jsp error page used the value of the HTTP request header X-ProxyContextPath without sanitization,
resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting attack. NiFi 1.8.0 correctly parses and sanitizes the request
attribute value. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.

### CVE-2018-17194

* Title: Potential Denial of Service with HTTP DELETE Cluster Replication Requests

  + GitHub Pull Request: [3035](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3035)

When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster for verification, the
Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length
value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. NiFi 1.8.0 checks DELETE
requests and overwrites non-zero Content-Length header. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.

The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent in conjunction with ARP spoofing and
meddler in the middle (MITM) intervention, resulting in cross-site request forgery. The required attack vector is
complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication, same subnet access, and injecting malicious code
into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a
Critical severity level. NiFi 1.8.0 applies Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering. Users running
a prior release should upgrade to 1.8.0.

## Requirements

NiFi supports modern operating systems and requires recent language versions for developing and running the application.

### Platform Requirements

* Java 21

### Optional Dependencies

* Python 3.10 or higher

## Projects

The source repository includes several component projects.

Please review individual project documentation for additional details.

* [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/)
* [Apache NiFi Registry](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-registry/nifi-registry-assembly/README.md)
* [Apache NiFi MiNiFi](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/minifi/minifi-assembly/README.md)

## Getting Started

Project guides provide extensive documentation for installing and extending the application.

* [Getting Started](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/nifi-latest/html/getting-started.html)
* [User Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/nifi-latest/html/user-guide.html)
* [Administrator Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/nifi-latest/html/administration-guide.html)
* [Developer Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/nifi-latest/html/developer-guide.html)

## Developing

NiFi uses the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) for project development. The Maven Wrapper provides
shell scripts that download and cache a selected version of [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for running build
commands.

Developing on Microsoft Windows requires using `mvnw.cmd` instead of `mvnw` to run Maven commands.

### Building

Run the following command to build project modules using parallel execution:

```
./mvnw install -T1C
```

Run the following command to build project modules using parallel execution with static analysis to confirm compliance
with code and licensing requirements:

```
./mvnw install -T1C -P contrib-check
```

Run the following command to build the application binaries without building other optional modules:

```
./mvnw install -T1C -am -pl :nifi-assembly
```

### Binaries

The `nifi-assembly` module contains the binary distribution.

```
ls nifi-assembly/target/nifi-*-bin.zip
```

The `nifi-assembly` module includes the binary distribution in a directory for local development and testing.

```
cd nifi-assembly/target/nifi-*-bin/nifi-*/
```

## Running

NiFi provides shell scripts for starting and stopping the system.

Running on Microsoft Windows requires using `nifi.cmd` instead of `nifi.sh` for system commands.

### Starting

Run the following command to start NiFi from the distribution directory:

```
./bin/nifi.sh start
```

### Accessing

The default configuration generates a random username and password on startup. NiFi writes the generated credentials
to the application log located in `logs/nifi-app.log` under the NiFi installation directory.

The following command can be used to find the generated credentials on operating systems with `grep` installed:

```
grep Generated logs/nifi-app*log
```

NiFi logs the generated credentials as follows:

```
Generated Username [USERNAME]
Generated Password [PASSWORD]
```

The `USERNAME` will be a random UUID composed of 36 characters. The `PASSWORD` will be a random string.

The username and password can be replaced with custom credentials using the following command:

```
./bin/nifi.sh set-single-user-credentials <username> <password>
```

NiFi defaults to running on the `localhost` address with HTTPS on port `8443` at the following URL:

```
https://localhost:8443/nifi

```

Browsers will display a warning message indicating a potential security risk due to the self-signed certificate
generated during initialization. Production deployments should provision a certificate from a trusted certificate
authority and update the NiFi keystore and truststore configuration.

# Summary

[NIFI-12403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12403) Improves the `JoltTransformJSON` Processor custom user interface parameter initialization parsing. The JavaScript controller sets Boolean properties based on initial state parameters, which are passed as strings. Adjusting the processing to use a simple string comparison avoids unnecessary additional parsing.

Just one minor change to keep consistent with how we define string in JavaScript (single quotes). Other than that, this works well.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Subject: CVE-2023-49145: Apache NiFi: Improper Neutralization of Input in
 Advanced User Interface for Jolt

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi 0.7.0 through 1.23.2

Description:

Apache NiFi 0.7.0 through 1.23.2 include the JoltTransformJSON Processor, which provides an advanced configuration user interface that is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. If an authenticated user, who is authorized to configure a JoltTransformJSON Processor, visits a crafted URL, then arbitrary
JavaScript code can be executed within the session context of the authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.24.0 or 2.0.0-M1 is the recommended mitigation.

This issue is being tracked as NIFI-12403
