Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-49145

**Description:** Improper Neutralization of Input in Advanced User Interface for Jolt.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The JoltTransformJSON Processor in Apache NiFi includes an advanced configuration user interface that is susceptible to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS). The vulnerability stems from how the user interface processes parameters, specifically how boolean properties are initialized. It uses JavaScript parsing, that was deemed unnecessary and introduced the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS through a crafted URL. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected and executed within the user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the session context of an authenticated user who is authorized to configure a JoltTransformJSON Processor.
- Potential Session Hijacking/Data Theft: Depending on the attacker's JavaScript code, this could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities within the user's authenticated session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: An attacker crafts a malicious URL and entices an authenticated user, authorized to configure JoltTransformJSON, to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user authorized to configure the JoltTransformJSON Processor.
- User Interaction: The attack requires the victim to visit a crafted URL.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache NiFi versions 0.7.0 through 1.23.2

**Fixed Versions:**
- Apache NiFi 1.24.0 and 2.0.0-M1.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the way the JavaScript controller initialized boolean properties. Instead of direct string comparison, it was performing unnecessary parsing of the string parameters.
- The fix involved simplifying the parameter processing by using a direct string comparison, eliminating the need for additional parsing which led to the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is present in the advanced user interface of JoltTransformJSON processor
