- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via crafted requests that exploit the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
