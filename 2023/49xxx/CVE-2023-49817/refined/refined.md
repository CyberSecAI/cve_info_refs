- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can perform actions they should not be able to, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete website compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user, meaning it is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or position are needed besides being able to interact with the vulnerable plugin.
