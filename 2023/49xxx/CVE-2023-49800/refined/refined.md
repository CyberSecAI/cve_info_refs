Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `nuxt-api-party` library directly passing user-controlled `fetchOptions` from the request body to the `ofetch` library without any sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to manipulate the `retry` option within `fetchOptions`, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Unfiltered Input:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation or filtering on the `fetchOptions` object. User-supplied data is directly used in subsequent operations.
- **Abuse of Retry Logic:** The `ofetch` library's recursive error handling mechanism for retries is exploited. Setting an extremely high retry count causes a stack overflow by exceeding stack memory limits.

**Impact:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a full denial of service, rendering the server unusable during the attack. This is caused by the server crashing due to a stack overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is initiated over the network by sending a malicious POST request to the server's API endpoint.
- **Direct API Interaction:** The attacker interacts directly with the API using HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges are required:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack doesn't require any interaction from other users of the system.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the server to send the malicious request.

**Technical Details:**
- The `fetchOptions` are extracted directly from the POST request body as JSON.
- These options are then directly passed into the `ofetch` function without validation.
- The attacker can control the `retry` parameter. Setting a high retry number will crash the server with a stack overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how the vulnerability is exploited.
- The vulnerability can be exploited with a single request.
- The `__proto__` property can be used to bypass endpoint checks.
- More complicated URIs can be used to build the stack faster.
- The fix involves limiting which options can be passed to `ofetch`.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5.
