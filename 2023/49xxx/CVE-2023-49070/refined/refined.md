    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the deprecated Apache XML-RPC library, which is no longer maintained.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of deprecated and unmaintained library"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is not directly specified, but the use of a deprecated library can lead to various security issues, including remote code execution or denial of service.",
