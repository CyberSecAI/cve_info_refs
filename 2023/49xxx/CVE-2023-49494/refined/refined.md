- The vulnerability is a **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `filename` parameter within the `select_media_post_wangEditor.php` file is vulnerable to XSS. This means that user-supplied input to this parameter is not properly sanitized or escaped, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- An attacker can potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions. The specific impact depends on the attacker's objectives and the capabilities of the injected JavaScript.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator accesses a malicious link.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted URL.
- An attacker needs to entice a victim (in this case, an administrator) to click on the malicious link. This can be achieved via email, chat, or other methods of social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `filename` parameter.
- The attacker needs a way to get a victim (specifically an administrator) to access the URL in their browser.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is of the format `http://target-ip/uploads/include/dialog/select_media_post_wangEditor.php?filename=<malicious_payload>`
