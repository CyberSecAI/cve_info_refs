Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `budgie-weathershow` applet in `budgie-extras` incorrectly handles temporary file paths. It reads data from a temporary location accessible by any local user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The applet reads weather data from a publicly accessible temporary file, leading to potential manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **GUI Manipulation:** A local attacker can pre-create this temporary file and insert malicious data, which will then be displayed by the weather applet. This could confuse users and potentially trick them.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can create a FIFO file at the expected temporary file path. Since the applet runs in the same thread as the budgie-panel, this could cause the applet to crash and potentially crash the entire budgie panel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the `budgie-weathershow` applet is running.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create and write to a file in the temporary directory location used by the applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to write to the temporary file location used by `budgie-weathershow`.
*   No specific user privileges are needed to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects `budgie-weathershow` versions greater than 1.4.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.1 of the applet.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.8.
*   The attack complexity is low, and no user interaction is required for exploitation.
*   The scope is "Changed" because the impact can potentially extend beyond the applet itself (to the entire panel)
*   The Ubuntu security notice indicates that CVE-2023-49346 is related to a set of vulnerabilities in Budgie Extras involving insecure temporary file handling.

This information is more detailed than the initial CVE description (which was a placeholder) and provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.
