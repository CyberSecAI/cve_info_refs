{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the physical susceptibility of EEG equipment to radio-frequency (RF) signal injection. The physical structure of the EEG equipment acts as an unintended antenna, receiving amplitude-modulated RF signals.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of shielding or filtering to prevent external RF interference from affecting EEG recordings.",
      "Vulnerability of the physical structure of EEG devices to act as antennas."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can remotely inject false brainwaves into the EEG device, which can lead to: \n- Taking control of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), such as a virtual keyboard speller, a drone-control interface, and a neuro-feedback meditation interface.\n- Forcing the input of any desired character with a virtual keyboard.\n- Crashing a drone by manipulating its controls.\n- Reporting false meditative states.\n- Severe misdiagnoses in clinical EEG tests.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote injection of amplitude-modulated RF signals.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to transmit RF signals with specific modulations and frequencies, which can be done using readily available Software Defined Radio (SDR) equipment and a power amplifier. The attacker does not need any access to the EEG data stream."
