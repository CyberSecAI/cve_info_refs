Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `lock.php` file of the `absis` application. Specifically, the `user` parameter passed through the GET request is directly outputted into the HTML without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes the value of the `user` parameter from the URL and directly reflects it in the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. They could also manipulate the content of the page to perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Phishing:** The injected script could redirect the user to a malicious login page, capture credentials, and perform other forms of phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the `user` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link, often through emails or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `user` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit this URL in their browser.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `absis/view/main/lock/lock.php` on line 16 and 55
*   The vulnerable parameter is `user` in GET request.
*   The specific vulnerable version of absis is <= 2017-10-19.
*   The provided exploit is: `http://127.0.0.1:81/absis/view/main/lock/lock.php?nama=1&user=XSS_TEST%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C/script%3E`
