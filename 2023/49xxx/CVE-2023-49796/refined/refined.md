The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49796.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames when handling file uploads or downloads, leading to a path injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `clear_filename` function did not properly remove all potentially harmful path traversal characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal/Injection:** The application was vulnerable to path injection because it did not properly sanitize filenames. An attacker could include characters such as `../` in the file name, potentially writing to locations outside of the intended temporary directory.
- **SSRF** - Although not directly related to the file write issue, the commit message indicates a SSRF was also fixed in this commit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem if they can control the filename. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data manipulation.
- The SSRF vulnerability could allow attackers to make requests to internal services, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading or providing a URL with a specially crafted filename containing path traversal characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files or provide URLs to be processed by the vulnerable application, and the ability to specify or manipulate the filename.
