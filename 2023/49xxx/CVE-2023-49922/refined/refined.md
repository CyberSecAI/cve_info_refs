- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Beats and Elastic Agent would log raw event data at the `WARN` or `ERROR` level in their own logs if ingesting that event into Elasticsearch failed with a `4xx` HTTP status code (excluding 409 and 429). This included sensitive data from the event itself.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure logging of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive or private information present in the events ingested by Beats or Elastic Agent. This information is written to the logs of the Beats or Elastic Agent.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can potentially induce the logging of sensitive information by sending data to Beats or Elastic Agent that will result in a 4xx HTTP error from Elasticsearch during ingestion, triggering the vulnerable logging behavior.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to a vulnerable Beats or Elastic Agent instance that will cause an ingestion error (4xx status) with Elasticsearch. The attacker needs to be in a position to potentially view the log files of the vulnerable system if they are not public.
