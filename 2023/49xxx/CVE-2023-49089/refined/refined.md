- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability when creating packages in Umbraco Backoffice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The "Package" section in Umbraco Backoffice allows a logged-in user to write folders outside of the default package directory using path traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Backoffice users with permissions to create packages can write files outside of the expected location, potentially leading to unauthorized file creation or modification.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the Umbraco Backoffice interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with permissions to create packages in the Umbraco Backoffice. The attacker requires low privileges.
