- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An open network port 8899 in the WiFi firmware of Bosch BCC101/BCC102/BCC50 thermostat products, which was intended for WiFi module development debugging.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Excessive attack surface due to the open port (CWE-1125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can connect to the device without authentication from the same WiFi network, potentially leading to compromised confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the local WiFi network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same WiFi network as the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
