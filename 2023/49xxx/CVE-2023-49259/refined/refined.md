  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The authentication cookies are generated using a weak algorithm based on the username, hardcoded secret, and the device's uptime.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable from Observable State (CWE-341)"
    ],
    "impact": "Allows an attacker to brute-force authentication cookies and potentially gain unauthorized access to the router.",
    "attack_vectors": "By observing the username and device uptime, and knowing the hardcoded secret, an attacker can predict/brute-force valid authentication cookies.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know or be able to obtain the username, device uptime, and the hardcoded secret. They also need to be able to generate authentication cookies based on this information."
