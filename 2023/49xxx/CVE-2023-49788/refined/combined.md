# CVE-2023-49788 Improper handling of browser-side provided input in richdocuments path handling

High

[caolanm](/caolanm)
published
GHSA-3r69-xvf7-v94j
Dec 8, 2023

## Package

richdocumentscode
(richdocumentscode)

## Affected versions

< 23.5.602

## Patched versions

23.5.602

## Description

### Impact

Unlike a standalone dedicated Collabora Online server, the Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) is run without chroot sandboxing. Vulnerable versions of the richdocumentscode app can be susceptible to attack via modified client->server commands to overwrite files outside the sub directory the server has provided for the transient session.

### Patches

The bug was fixed in Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) release 23.5.602.

### Workarounds

None, except removing Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) app or using standalone dedicated Collabora Online server.

### Credits

Thanks to Reginaldo Silva of ubercomp.com for discovering this flaw.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-49788

### Weaknesses

[CWE-501](/advisories?query=cwe%3A501)
