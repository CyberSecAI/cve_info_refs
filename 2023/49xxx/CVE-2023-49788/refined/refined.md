- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of browser-side provided input in richdocuments path handling. The built-in CODE server (richdocumentscode) runs without chroot sandboxing, making it susceptible to attacks via modified client-to-server commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the server's improper handling of client-provided file paths, allowing for potential file overwrites outside the designated sub-directory for the session. Specifically, the server does not properly sanitize or validate the file paths, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks using modified client-server commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the server. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, such as data loss, configuration modification, or even code execution if an attacker overwrites critical system files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating client-to-server commands to include file paths that traverse outside the intended directory. By sending crafted commands with specially crafted paths, an attacker can exploit the lack of input validation and achieve arbitrary file overwrites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send commands to the server. The attacker also needs to have some knowledge of the file structure to perform a targeted attack.
