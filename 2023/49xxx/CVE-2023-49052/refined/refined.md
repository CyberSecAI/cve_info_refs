Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient validation of uploaded files in the "File Upload" functionality of Microweber CMS version 2.0.4.  Despite configured file type restrictions, the system allows uploading of malicious HTML files, which can then be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application fails to properly validate the content of uploaded files, allowing arbitrary HTML files to bypass restrictions meant for images or custom file types.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The system doesn't sanitize or neutralize the uploaded HTML content before storing and serving it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading and executing malicious HTML files, attackers can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of users' browsers.
- **Information Theft:** This can lead to stealing session cookies, login credentials, and other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or install malware through the injected scripts.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers might be able to alter the visual appearance and/or functionality of the website via the injected HTML/JS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Form:** Attackers can leverage the "File Upload" field in a contact form (or other forms with this functionality) to upload the malicious HTML files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Microweber CMS installation.
- **Form Access:** They need to be able to access a form that includes the file upload field.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to create the malicious file and know how to access it.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists even when file type validations such as "Image Files" or "Custom File Types" (.jpg) are in place.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can upload an HTML file with a simple JavaScript alert to showcase the vulnerability.
- The malicious file is accessible under `http://yoursite.com/userfiles/media/default/contact_form/poc.htm` (or similar path), which allows the attacker to run the uploaded file.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Microweber version 2.0.5.
