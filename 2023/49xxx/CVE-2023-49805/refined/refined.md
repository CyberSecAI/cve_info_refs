The provided content is related to CVE-2023-49805.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not validate the `Origin` header when establishing WebSocket connections using Socket.IO.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing origin validation for WebSocket connections.
- Allows cross-origin requests to connect to the WebSocket server.
- Circumvents reverse proxy or firewall protections if "No-auth" mode is configured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Third-party websites can access the application on behalf of their clients.
- Without login credentials, attackers cannot access protected endpoints containing sensitive data.
- Attackers may exploit unseen vulnerabilities through the established connection.
- Full application access can be gained by attackers if "No-auth" mode is configured and relying on reverse proxy or firewall protections.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attacker serves a malicious HTML document on a different origin.
- The malicious HTML uses JavaScript to open a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a web page to serve the malicious Javascript.
- The attacker needs to know the target application's URL
- No user interaction is required other than accessing the malicious page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.23.8 of the uptime-kuma docker image
- The patch is available in version 1.23.9 of the uptime-kuma docker image
- The fix implements a check to compare the `Origin` header with the `Host` header, denying connections if they don't match.
- The check can be bypassed by setting `UPTIME_KUMA_WS_ORIGIN_CHECK=bypass` in the environment variables.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.0 (Moderate).
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-1385.
