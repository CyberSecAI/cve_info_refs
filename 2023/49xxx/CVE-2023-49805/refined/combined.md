# Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets

Moderate

[louislam](/louislam)
published
GHSA-mj22-23ff-2hrr
Dec 10, 2023

## Package

## Affected versions

## Description

### Summary

The application uses WebSocket (with Socket.io), but it does not verify that the source of communication is valid. This allows third-party website to access the application on behalf of their client.

### Details

When connecting to the server using Socket.IO, the server does not validate the `Origin` header leading to other site being able to open connections to the server and communicate with it.

Other website still need to authenticate to access most features, however this can circumvent reverse proxy or firewall protections made in place by users deploying the application.

### PoC

On another origin, you can serve the following HTML document.

```
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.7.2/socket.io.min.js"></script>
<script>
        const socket = io("wss://[TARGET_WEBSITE]", { transports: ["websocket"] });
        socket.emit("getGameList", console.log.bind(console))
</script>
```

### Impact

Without origin validation, Javascript executed from another origin would be allowed to connect to the application without any user interaction. Without login credentials, such a connection is unable to access protected endpoints containing sensitive data of the application. However, such a connection may allow attacker to further exploit unseen vulnerabilities of the application.

Users with "No-auth" mode configured who are relying on a reverse proxy or firewall to provide protection to the application would be especially vulnerable as it would grant the attacker full access to the application.

### Remediation

Additional verification of the HTTP `Origin` header has been added to the socket.io connection handler. By default, if the `Origin` header is present, it would be checked against the `Host` header. Connection would be denied if the hostnames do not match, which would indicate that the request is cross-origin. Connection would be allowed if the `Origin` header is not present.

Users can override this behaviour by setting environment variable `UPTIME_KUMA_WS_ORIGIN_CHECK=bypass`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
