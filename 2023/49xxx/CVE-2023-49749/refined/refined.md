- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress SureTriggers plugin <= 1.0.23 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through CSRF. An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs an unintended action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with higher privileges into triggering the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the targeted website.
