WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-46143

Affected devices do not check the TFTP blocksize correctly. This could allow an authenticated attacker
to read from an uninitialized buffer that potentially contains previously allocated data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44318

Affected devices use a hardcoded key to obfuscate the configuration backup that an administrator can
export from the device. This could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges or an
attacker that obtains a configuration backup to extract configuration information from the exported file.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44319

Affected devices use a weak checksum algorithm to protect the configuration backup that an administra-
tor can export from the device. This could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges
or an attacker that tricks a legitimate administrator to upload a modified configuration file to change the
configuration of an affected device.

CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44322

Affected devices can be configured to send emails when certain events occur on the device. When
presented with an invalid response from the SMTP server, the device triggers an error that disrupts
email sending. An attacker with access to the network can use this to do disable notification of users
when certain events occur.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W-700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ax or 802.11n standard. They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44317

Affected products do not properly validate the content of uploaded X509 certificates which could allow an attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code on the device.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.2 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 8.6 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-349: Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44318

Affected devices use a hardcoded key to obfuscate the configuration backup that an administrator can export from the device. This could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges or an attacker that obtains a configuration backup to extract configuration information from the exported file.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 4.9 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 6.9 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44319

Affected devices use a weak checksum algorithm to protect the configuration backup that an administrator can export from the device. This could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges or an attacker that tricks a legitimate administrator to upload a modified configuration file to change the configuration of an affected device.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 4.9 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 6.9 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44374

Affected devices allow to change the password, but insufficiently check which password is to be changed. With this an authenticated attacker could, under certain conditions, be able to change the password of another, potential admin user, which could allow to escalate privileges.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 7.1 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-567: Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context |

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Restrict access to application webserver for trusted users only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
