The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `referrerpolicy` attribute on `<a>` tags was not being removed by Readability.js when rendering pages in Reader Mode in Firefox for iOS. This allowed an attacker to bypass the intended referrer policy set by `<meta name="referrer" content="never">` and the `Referrer-Policy` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of HTML content in Reader Mode. Specifically, the `referrerpolicy` attribute was not removed, leading to a relaxation of referrer policy.
- Privilege escalation vulnerability due to access to internal pages or data.
- The ability to leak a secret "uuidkey" via the referrer header when transitioning to an external link.
-  The existence of XSS vulnerability in sessionrestore page that can be abused to gain access to internal://local pages once the uuidkey is obtained.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exfiltrate a security key ("uuidkey") from Reader Mode.
- The leaked "uuidkey" allows access to internal://local URLs, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal pages or data.
- Cross-origin data can be stolen by leveraging an XSS vulnerability and the ability to access internal pages.
- Full compromise of the application

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious page with a crafted `<a>` tag including a `referrerpolicy="unsafe-url"` attribute.
- The victim has to open this page in Firefox for iOS, switch to reader mode, and click the link provided by the attacker.
-  The crafted link redirects the user to attacker controlled page with the uuidkey in the referrer header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a webpage on a server under their control
- Ability to convince a user to open the attacker's page in Firefox for iOS, switch to reader mode and click the crafted link.
- No specific network position is required, an attacker can use a public web server.
