Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes of the Auth Server. Specifically, the application does not adequately verify if the file path requested through the URL is actually the intended image, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-23):** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended `user_images` directory by manipulating the `username` parameter in the URL. This is because the code doesn't sanitize the path effectively before using it in `os.path.isfile()` or `FileResponse()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive files on the server by crafting malicious `username` parameters. This access could expose configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data that the attacker should not have access to.
*   The severity is categorized as "Moderate".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `get_pfp` and `get_banner` endpoints of the Auth Server.
*   By manipulating the `username` parameter in the URL (e.g., `../`, `/etc/passwd`), an attacker could attempt to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Auth Server.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker would need to be aware of the vulnerable endpoints `/get_pfp/{username}` and `/get_banner/{username}`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `src/auth_server.py`.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions `<= 1.3.2`.
*   The fix is implemented in version `>= 1.4.0`.
*   The fix includes sanitization of the `username` input using `username.isalnum()`, which restricts the username to alphanumeric characters to prevent path traversal.
*   The GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability is GHSA-3v77-pvqq-qg3f.
