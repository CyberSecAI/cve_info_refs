# Uncontrolled Data in Path Expression

Moderate

[Superior126](/Superior126)
published
GHSA-3v77-pvqq-qg3f
Jan 8, 2024

## Package

auth\_server.py
(Python)

## Affected versions

<= 1.3.2

## Patched versions

>=1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

The issue relates to the `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes on Auth Server. The issue is that there is no check to ensure that the file that Auth Server is receiving through these URLs is correct. This could allow an attacker access to files they shouldn't have access to.

### Patches

Lif has patched this issue in version 1.4.0 or higher.
