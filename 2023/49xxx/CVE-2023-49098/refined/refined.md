Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the Discourse Reactions plugin, specifically in how it handles requests for reaction data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the exposure of user reaction notification data due to a lack of proper authorization checks. Specifically, the `/discourse-reactions/posts/reactions.json` endpoint allowed users to view reactions given by other users, including reactions on private messages, without proper access control. This issue was present in the `reactions_given` and `reactions_received` methods within `custom_reactions_controller.rb`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's reaction notification data. This could reveal:
    - Which users have reacted to posts of the target user.
    - Which posts a user has reacted to
    - User ID, Post ID, Reaction ID

This vulnerability has a **Low** Confidentiality impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a low level of privileges (e.g., a normal user account).
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint `/discourse-reactions/posts/reactions.json` or `/discourse-reactions/posts/reactions-received.json`, with the username of the targeted user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `discourse-reactions` plugin for Discourse.
- The vulnerable versions are `<= 0.4`.
- The patched versions are `>= 0.4`.
- The fix involves restricting custom reaction access, as evidenced by the commit message "SECURITY: restrict custom reaction access".
- The fix is visible in the provided diffs, which demonstrate changes in access control checks, specifically in the `custom_reactions_controller.rb` and associated tests in `custom_reactions_controller_spec.rb`. The diffs show that the code is changed to check if the user has the ability to see the profile and notifications of the targeted user before retrieving reactions, and that a normal user cannot retrieve reactions from other users.
- The commit log also confirms that a user should not be able to retrieve reactions for private messages of other users.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 4.3.
