The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49550.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs due to an issue in the `mjs` component. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the processing of certain JSON strings causing a write memory access at address `0x4ec508`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Segmentation violation (SEGV) due to a memory access error.
- Potential vulnerability when parsing maliciously crafted JSON strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JSON string sent to the `mjs` component.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by parsing a specifically crafted JSON string leading to the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `mjs` component, specifically crafted JSON strings.
- This could be a remote attacker if the vulnerable component is exposed.

**Additional details:**
- The specific commit `b1b6eac` of `cesanta/mjs` version 2.20.0 is affected.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output pinpoints a SEGV at the address `0x4ec508` during a WRITE memory access, triggered by the provided PoC.
- The PoC consists of JavaScript code that parses specific JSON string that triggers the vulnerability.
