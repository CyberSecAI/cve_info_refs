### **[jnovikov](/jnovikov)** commented [Oct 28, 2023](/jnovikov/7f411ae9fe6a9a7804cf162a3bdbb44b?permalink_comment_id=4742309#gistcomment-4742309)

Current "aiohttp" version (3.8.6) is vulnerable to CRLF injection if user controls the HTTP method using aiohttp client.

This can allow attackers to exploit various SSRF vulnerabilities.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# ClientSession is vulnerable to CRLF injection via method

Low

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-qvrw-v9rv-5rjx
Nov 26, 2023

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.9.0

## Patched versions

3.9.0

## Description

### Summary

Improper validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP method.

### Details

The vulnerability occurs only if the attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST etc.) of the request.

Previous releases performed no validation on the provided value. If an attacker controls the HTTP method it will be used as is and can lead to HTTP request smuggling.

### PoC

A minimal example can be found here:

<https://gist.github.com/jnovikov/7f411ae9fe6a9a7804cf162a3bdbb44b>

### Impact

If the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request it will be able to modify the request (request smuggling).

### Workaround

If unable to upgrade and using user-provided values for the request method, perform manual validation of the user value (e.g. by restricting it to a few known values like GET, POST etc.).

Patch: <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/7806/files>

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-49082

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
