Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The App Search Documents API was logging the raw contents of indexed documents at the `INFO` log level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive or private information contained within the indexed documents could be exposed by being written into the application logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: An attacker with access to the logs could potentially read sensitive or private information contained within the indexed documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Log access: The attack vector is having access to the log files where the sensitive information was inadvertently recorded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have access to the application logs where the raw contents of the indexed documents were written. This could be through unauthorized access to the server's filesystem, or via an exposed logging aggregation system.
- No specific actions are needed on part of users other than using the API and indexing data.
- The application itself was logging the data, so no direct interaction is required from the attacker's side with the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue affects Enterprise Search versions between 7.0.0 and 7.17.16, and 8.0.0 and 8.11.2.
- The vulnerability is only triggered when the Documents API is directly used and the ingested documents contain sensitive information.
- The fix involves changing the log level to `DEBUG` which is disabled by default and is present in versions 7.17.16 and 8.11.2.
- As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade can set the `log_level` to `WARN` or higher to prevent logging of document content.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
