Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a combination of SQL injection and insufficient processing of the include file path within the `link.php` file of the Cacti application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the `external_links` table, specifically to control the `contentfile` field.
2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize the `contentfile` value from the database, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path to include using `include()` statement, leading to LFI vulnerability.
3.  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to prevent directory traversal using `str_replace('..', '', $path)`, but this can be bypassed using `....//....//....//....//` style input, demonstrating a lack of robust input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining SQL injection and LFI vulnerabilities, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker poisons the `/opt/cacti/log/cacti.log` log file by injecting php code into it via SQL injection. Then, when including this log file using the LFI vulnerability, the attacker can achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker leverages a SQL injection vulnerability in the `pollers.php` script to insert a crafted file path into the `external_links` table.
2.  **Local File Inclusion:** The attacker uses the manipulated `contentfile` value in `link.php` to include an arbitrary file (specifically, the poisoned log file) leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authorized user within the Cacti application to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability and also have "External Link Permissions".
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cacti web interface.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can insert a malicious path into the `contentfile` field of the `external_links` table using SQL injection.
- The attacker can also poison the log file `/opt/cacti/log/cacti.log` by injecting a php payload using SQL injection.
- The vulnerability exists in the `link.php` file when processing `contentfile` value.
- The attacker leverages LFI by tricking the application into including the poisoned log file, achieving arbitrary code execution on the server.
- The fix involves improving data escaping and input sanitization to prevent local file inclusion.
