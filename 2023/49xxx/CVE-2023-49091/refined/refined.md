- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JWT (JSON Web Token) used for authentication does not expire or invalidate upon user logout or password change.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper JWT invalidation or expiration after a user logs out or changes their password, leading to persistent session tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a valid JWT can gain unauthorized access to the application even after the user has logged out or changed their password. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of data, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), since the attacker needs network access to send requests with the valid JWT.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a valid JWT obtained before the user logged out or changed their password. The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N), but some user interaction is required (UI:R) to obtain the initial token.
