- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of uploaded file types in DoraCMS user avatar upload functionality. This allows an attacker to upload an HTML file disguised as an image, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) or contain malicious links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate file extensions or content, allowing HTML files to be uploaded as avatars.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to upload HTML files with JavaScript allows for XSS attacks, where malicious scripts can be executed in the context of a user's browser.
    - **Malicious Link Insertion:** The system also allows embedding malicious links within the uploaded "images", which users might inadvertently click.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **XSS Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - **Malware Distribution:** By embedding malicious links, attackers can trick users into downloading and executing malware, compromising their systems.
    - **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to phishing pages, stealing credentials.
    - **Account Takeover:** The attacker can use the compromised user account to perform more privileged actions on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **File Upload:** The attacker uses the user avatar upload functionality to upload a malicious HTML file.
    - **Request Modification:** The attacker modifies the request to change the file extension from an image to HTML.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the user management interface of the DoraCMS system, indicating that the attacker likely has some level of authorization.
    - The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, which can be done using tools like Burp Suite.
