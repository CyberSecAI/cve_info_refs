- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically an injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into a website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts are injected into the website, likely through a user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized. The injected script is then executed in the browser of users visiting the page.
