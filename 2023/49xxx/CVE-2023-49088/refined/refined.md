{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The fix for CVE-2023-39515 was incomplete. Although changes were made to HTML encode the 'title' attribute of the data source path, this encoded value is passed to jquery-ui in an unsafe way to create a tooltip. The browser then transforms the HTML encoded data in the attribute back to HTML, allowing execution of malicious code in the tooltip.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by poisoning data in the Cacti database. This can lead to:\n\n*   Victim-account takeover\n*   Arbitrary actions on the platform as the victim user\n*   Redirection to a malicious website\n*   Phishing attacks\n*   Browser related exploits\n*   Participation in DDoS attacks",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions can inject malicious JavaScript code into the data source path. When a user with permissions to view `data_debug.php` hovers over the malicious data source path, the JavaScript code is executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authorized Cacti user with 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions. The victim needs to be a Cacti user with permissions to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`."
