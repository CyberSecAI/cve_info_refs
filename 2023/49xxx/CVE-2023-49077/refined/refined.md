**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the Quarantine UI of mailcow: dockerized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Quarantine UI does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input (specifically, email content). This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

  - Further attacks within the system.
  - Compromise of the administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends a specially crafted email containing malicious JavaScript code.
- When an administrator opens or previews the email in the Quarantine UI, the malicious code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the mail server.
- No special privileges are required, just the ability to send emails.
- The attacker relies on user interaction (the administrator opening/previewing the malicious email).
