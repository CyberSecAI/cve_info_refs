# XSS Vulnerability in Quarantine UI Allows Unauthorized Access and Data Manipulation

High

[DerLinkman](/DerLinkman)
published
GHSA-46x4-w2fm-5x6g
Nov 27, 2023

## Package

mailcow: dockerized

## Affected versions

< 2023-11

## Patched versions

>= 2023-11

## Description

### Impact

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Quarantine UI of the system. This vulnerability poses a significant threat to administrators who utilize the Quarantine feature, as it allows malicious actors to execute arbitrary code within the context of the admin's session.

Exploitation of this vulnerability occurs when an attacker sends a carefully crafted email containing malicious JavaScript code. Upon opening or previewing the email within the Quarantine UI, the injected code is executed, enabling the attacker to compromise the administrator's session. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or the initiation of further attacks within the system.

### Patches

Versions including 2023-11 and later

### Workarounds

Disable Quarantine feature under System -> Configuration -> Options -> Quarantine

### Severity

High

8.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
