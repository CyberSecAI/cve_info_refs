Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way PyInstaller-built applications handle temporary directories on Windows, specifically when using the `matplotlib` or `win32com` libraries. These libraries' run-time hooks create temporary directories using `tempfile.mkdtemp`. While this function is intended to create secure directories, it does not do so on Windows. The underlying `os.mkdir` call ignores POSIX permissions, and the access control is determined by the parent directory's permissions. This can lead to the temporary directory being accessible to other users, especially if the `TEMP` or `TMP` environment variables point to a system-wide location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Temporary Directory Creation on Windows:** The use of `tempfile.mkdtemp` does not provide sufficient security on Windows, allowing unauthorized access to temporary directories.
2.  **Symlink Attack Vulnerability:** When running in privileged mode with developer mode enabled on Windows, a malicious user can exploit the lack of hardened mode in `shutil.rmtree` to perform a symlink attack, potentially deleting files they do not have access to. This occurs because the `shutil.rmtree` function, used for cleanup, has a race condition when checking symlinks.
3.  **Directory Junctions Vulnerability (Python 3.7 and earlier):** Applications built with Python 3.7.x or earlier do not have protection against directory junction links, exacerbating the symlink attack vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An unprivileged attacker, through a malicious crafted symlink in a temp directory, could trick a privileged PyInstaller application into deleting files the unprivileged attacker would not normally have permission to delete.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.
2.  **Unprotected Temporary Directory:** The `TEMP` or `TMP` environment variables must point to a location that is not exclusively protected for the user running the application or a system-wide location.
3.  **Timing Window or Vulnerable Python Version:**
    *   For Python >= 3.8.0, the attacker must be able to very precisely time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink between the symlink check and the file deletion in the `shutil.rmtree` function.
    *   For Python 3.7.x or earlier, the application is vulnerable to directory junction attacks, making exploitation easier.
4.  **Elevated Privileges:** The targeted application must run with elevated privileges, for instance, as an administrator.
5.  **Vulnerable PyInstaller version:** The application must be built using a version of PyInstaller older than 5.13.1.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local access to the system.
*   Ability to create files and directories in the same temp directory the vulnerable application is using
*   Ability to set up the correct conditions (symlink timing or using an old Python version) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in PyInstaller version 5.13.1 with the changes introduced in pull request #7827, which replaced `tempfile.mkdtemp` with a custom function that creates secure directories on Windows. This change also included hardening the `shutil.rmtree` function, using a secure directory creation process using security descriptors.
*   The fix includes a new `_pyi_rth_utils` package for sharing the secure directory creation code.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-379, which relates to insecure temporary file handling.

In summary, CVE-2023-49797 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in applications built with vulnerable versions of PyInstaller, which can lead to unauthorized file deletion on Windows systems.
