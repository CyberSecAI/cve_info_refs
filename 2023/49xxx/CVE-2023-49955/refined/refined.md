Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the `chargePointVendor` property within the `BootNotification` message of the OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol). Specifically, the server was not enforcing the specified maximum length (20 characters) for this field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper validation on the length of the `chargePointVendor` field before processing the `BootNotification` message.
*  **Lack of Message Size Limitation:**  There was also no global limit on the size of incoming messages, allowing for extremely large messages to be sent.
*  **Database Storage of Invalid Data:** Oversized values in other fields like `idTag` in `Authorize` messages were being stored in the database without prior validation, potentially leading to database bloat and performance issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a `BootNotification` message with an excessively large `chargePointVendor` value (442 MB in the described test) resulted in the server crashing, causing a DoS.
* **Database Storage Exhaustion:**  Accepting and storing excessively large values (e.g., 10MB idTag) could lead to database storage exhaustion, affecting application performance and stability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector involves sending malicious OCPP messages over the network to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the OCPP.Core application to send crafted OCPP messages.
*   **OCPP Message Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the OCPP protocol and the structure of `BootNotification` messages to craft the malicious payload with oversized fields.

**Additional Details:**

*   The developers initially expected the server to simply fail deserialization of the large message with an exception, however the server crashed instead.
*  The issue was resolved in version 1.2.0 by enabling message validation and limiting the maximum message size.
*  The fix addresses both the DoS vulnerability caused by oversized `chargePointVendor` and the issue of storing large, invalid data in the database.
