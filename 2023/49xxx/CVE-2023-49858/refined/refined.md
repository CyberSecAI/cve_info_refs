Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a "Broken Access Control" issue. This means that there are missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function within the plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privilege levels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms. The plugin fails to adequately verify user permissions before allowing access to certain functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed but, generally, it allows a lower-privileged user to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the plugin that is missing access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with "Subscriber" level privileges. This suggests that exploitation does not require administrative access, making it a more widely exploitable vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects the WordPress "Custom Login" plugin versions 4.1.0 and earlier.
*   The issue is fixed in version 4.1.1.
*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
