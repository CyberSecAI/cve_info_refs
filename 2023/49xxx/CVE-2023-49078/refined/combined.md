# Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in raptor-web 0.4.4

Moderate

[zediious](/zediious)
published
GHSA-8r6g-fhh4-xhmq
Nov 25, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

0.4.4

## Patched versions

0.4.4.1

## Description

### Patched

This XSS vulnerability has been patched in [v0.4.4.1](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/releases/tag/0.4.4.1)

Thanks a ton to [@ejedev](https://github.com/ejedev) for finding this and reporting it!

### Summary

Starting in version 0.4.4 of raptor-web, it is possible to craft a malicious URL that will result in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. A user controlled URL parameter is loaded into an internal template that has autoescape disabled.

### Details

To show the flow of this vulnerability we will start off with a request made to `/announcements?server=test`

The base template is loaded, located here: <https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/d53f46bed260ed23742a89e6a414228b75dab797/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/base.html>

It builds the following `htmx` object, which on `load` will automatically send a `GET` request to `raptormc/api/html/announcements?server=test`

[raptor-web/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/base.html](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/d53f46bed260ed23742a89e6a414228b75dab797/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/base.html#L79-L84)

Lines 79 to 84
in
[d53f46b](/zediious/raptor-web/commit/d53f46bed260ed23742a89e6a414228b75dab797)

|  | <div hx-get="/raptormc/api/html/{{request.path|strip\_slash}}{% if request.GET %}?{% for param in request.GET %}{{param}}={% get\_param param %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}" |
| --- | --- |
|  | hx-trigger='load' |
|  | hx-target='#home' |
|  | hx-swap="innerHTML" |
|  | hx-indicator="#mainLoadingspinner"> |
|  | </div> |

The `TemplateView` for `announcements` is rendered here:

[raptor-web/raptorWeb/raptormc/views.py](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391/raptorWeb/raptormc/views.py#L52-L74)

Lines 52 to 74
in
[2776281](/zediious/raptor-web/commit/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391)

|  | class Announcements(TemplateView): |
| --- | --- |
|  | """ |
|  | Page containing the last 30 announcements from Discord |
|  | """ |
|  | template\_name: str = join( |
|  | TEMPLATE\_DIR\_RAPTORMC, 'defaultpages/announcements.html') |
|  |  |
|  | def get(self, request: HttpRequest, \*args: Any, \*\*kwargs: Any) -> HttpResponse: |
|  | if not DefaultPages.objects.get\_or\_create(pk=1)[0].announcements: |
|  | return HttpResponseRedirect('/404') |
|  |  |
|  | if request.headers.get('HX-Request') != "true": |
|  | return HttpResponseRedirect('/404') |
|  |  |
|  | return super().get(request, \*args, \*\*kwargs) |
|  |  |
|  | def get\_context\_data(self, \*\*kwargs: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]: |
|  | context: dict[str, Any] = super().get\_context\_data(\*\*kwargs) |
|  | if self.request.GET: |
|  | context['opened\_server\_pk'] = self.request.GET.get('server') |
|  | return get\_or\_create\_informative\_text( |
|  | context = context, |
|  | informative\_text\_names = ["Announcements Information"]) |

The `get_context_data` method sets `opened_server_pk` equal to the URL parameter `server`.

[raptor-web/raptorWeb/raptormc/views.py](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391/raptorWeb/raptormc/views.py#L71)

Line 71
in
[2776281](/zediious/raptor-web/commit/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391)

|  | context['opened\_server\_pk'] = self.request.GET.get('server') |
| --- | --- |

This template is not accessible directly, and requires the header `HX-Request` to be set to `true`. This is done by the `hx-get` div loaded in the base.

The `announcements` template itself is located here: <https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/defaultpages/announcements.html>

It notably sets `{% autoescape off %}` for the majority of the template:

[raptor-web/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/defaultpages/announcements.html](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/defaultpages/announcements.html#L26)

Line 26
in
[2776281](/zediious/raptor-web/commit/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391)

|  | {% autoescape off %} |
| --- | --- |

The template attempts to build a second `htmx` object, making a call to the `server_announcements_poll` endpoint:

[raptor-web/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/defaultpages/announcements.html](https://github.com/zediious/raptor-web/blob/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391/raptorWeb/templates/raptormc/defaultpages/announcements.html#L51-L56)

Lines 51 to 56
in
[2776281](/zediious/raptor-web/commit/2776281eb12fa04eca177bbfe92a4cfcd74ba391)

|  | <div id="server\_announcements" |
| --- | --- |
|  | hx-get="{% url 'gameservers:server\_announcements\_poll' %}{% if request.GET %}?server={{opened\_server\_pk}}{% endif %}" |
|  | hx-trigger="load" |
|  | hx-target="#server\_announcements" |
|  | hx-swap="outerHTML"></div> |
|  | </div> |

However, since there is no autoescape enabled, we are able to inject Javacript as we have full control over the `opened_server_pk` value being rendered. The original `hx-get` call from the base template will inject the results of this secondary template as `innerHTML`, rendering it for the user.

### PoC

We'll make the following request to the server: `/announcements?server=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C%2fscript%3E`. When URL decoded, it looks like this:

`/announcements?server="><script>alert("XSS")</script>`

This results in the `base` template rendering an `htmx` object that looks like this:

```
          <div hx-get="/raptormc/api/html/announcements?server=&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;"
               hx-trigger='load'
               hx-target='#home'
               hx-swap="innerHTML"
               hx-indicator="#mainLoadingspinner">
          </div>
```

Once the page loads, it makes a `GET` request to `/raptormc/api/html/announcements?server=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C/script%3E`.

This request renders the `announcements` template, and includes an `htmx` object that looks like this:

```
      <div id="server_announcements"
           hx-get="/api/servers/html/server_announcements_poll/?server="><script>alert("XSS")</script>"
           hx-trigger="load"
           hx-target="#server_announcements"
           hx-swap="outerHTML"></div>
```

As we can see, we were able to escape from the `hx-get` attribute as the template does not have autoescape enabled. We injected a `script` object which is then returned all the way to the original `base` template and executed, causing a cross-site scripting vulnerability to occur.

The PoC url to test this is `https://SITE.COM/announcements?server=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C%2fscript%3E`

### Impact

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects all deployments of `raptor-web` on version `0.4.4`. Any victim who clicks on a malicious crafted link will be affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
