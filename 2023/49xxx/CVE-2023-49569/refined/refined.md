- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability exists in `go-git` when using `ChrootOS` file system, due to how the library handles server responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create and modify files across the filesystem. In the worst-case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a maliciously crafted Git server response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control or have the ability to modify a git server response and have a go-git client that uses ChrootOS file system to fetch from that repository.
