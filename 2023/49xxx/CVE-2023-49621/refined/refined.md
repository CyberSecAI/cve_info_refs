- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "intermediate installation" system state of the affected application uses default credentials with admin privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of default credentials (CWE-1392).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could use the default credentials to gain complete control of the affected device. This implies they could potentially read and modify all data and parameters on the device, execute arbitrary code, and impact availability by shutting down the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to reach the affected device over the network.
