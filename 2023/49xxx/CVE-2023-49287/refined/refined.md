Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Buffer overflows in the `tinydir_file_open` function of the TinyDir library when handling long path names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** Occurs in `tinydir_file_open` due to insufficient buffer size when copying or manipulating file paths, specifically when using `_tinydir_strcpy` on `file_name_buf` and `_tinydir_strcat` to concatenate `file_name_buf` and `ext_buf`.
- **Insecure `splitpath` API Usage**: On Windows,  `_tsplitpath` is used which may be vulnerable itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful overflow can crash the application using the library.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  If the input crosses a security boundary, a carefully crafted overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing a long path as input to the `tinydir_file_open` function, either directly or through a program using TinyDir.
- Windows-specific vulnerabilities can be triggered with long paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide or control the input path to the affected function.
- For Windows-specific issues, the attacker would need to be in a Windows environment.
- No privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `tinydir.h` at lines 675-680, 706 and 711.
- The `file_name_buf` buffer has a limited size.
-  The vulnerable `_tinydir_strcpy` and `_tinydir_strcat` operations on this buffer do not check for bounds.
- The Windows `_tsplitpath` function is used insecurely and may cause overflows.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in TinyDir versions 1.2.5 and earlier.
- A patch is available in version 1.2.6.
- The vulnerability was reported by 0xdea (Marco Ivaldi).
- The advisory has a high severity rating of 7.7.
- The CVSS vector is  CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.
