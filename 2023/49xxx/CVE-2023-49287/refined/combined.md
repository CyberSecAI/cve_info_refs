# Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in tinydir

High

[cxong](/cxong)
published
GHSA-jf5r-wgf4-qhxf
Dec 3, 2023

## Package

tinydir

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.5 (latest)

## Patched versions

1.2.6

## Description

### Summary

I spotted some buffer overflow vulnerabilities at the following locations in the tinydir source code:

<https://github.com/cxong/tinydir/blob/master/tinydir.h#L675-L680>

<https://github.com/cxong/tinydir/blob/master/tinydir.h#L706>

<https://github.com/cxong/tinydir/blob/master/tinydir.h#L711>

### Details

Buffer overflows in the `tinydir_file_open()` function, see marked lines below:

```
/* Open a single file given its path */
_TINYDIR_FUNC
int tinydir_file_open(tinydir_file *file, const _tinydir_char_t *path)
{
	tinydir_dir dir;
	int result = 0;
	int found = 0;
	_tinydir_char_t dir_name_buf[_TINYDIR_PATH_MAX];
	_tinydir_char_t file_name_buf[_TINYDIR_FILENAME_MAX];
	_tinydir_char_t *dir_name;
	_tinydir_char_t *base_name;
#if (defined _MSC_VER || defined __MINGW32__)
	_tinydir_char_t drive_buf[_TINYDIR_PATH_MAX];
	_tinydir_char_t ext_buf[_TINYDIR_FILENAME_MAX];
#endif

	if (file == NULL || path == NULL || _tinydir_strlen(path) == 0)
	{
		errno = EINVAL;
		return -1;
	}
	if (_tinydir_strlen(path) + _TINYDIR_PATH_EXTRA >= _TINYDIR_PATH_MAX)
	{
		errno = ENAMETOOLONG;
		return -1;
	}

	/* Get the parent path */
#if (defined _MSC_VER || defined __MINGW32__)
#if ((defined _MSC_VER) && (_MSC_VER >= 1400))
	errno = _tsplitpath_s(
		path,
		drive_buf, _TINYDIR_DRIVE_MAX,
		dir_name_buf, _TINYDIR_FILENAME_MAX,
		file_name_buf, _TINYDIR_FILENAME_MAX,
		ext_buf, _TINYDIR_FILENAME_MAX);
#else
	_tsplitpath(
		path,
		drive_buf,
		dir_name_buf,
		file_name_buf,

The other two vulnerabilities are Windows-specific. It should be possible to replicate them by crafting long paths in a similar way.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
