  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the URL in `nuxt-api-party`. A regular expression was used to check if a URL was absolute. This check could be bypassed by adding leading whitespace such as newline characters, which are later trimmed by the fetch API.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Credentials Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass the intended URL restrictions, potentially leaking sensitive API credentials or performing SSRF attacks.",

      "By manipulating the path parameter to include a URL with leading whitespace, an attacker can cause the application to send requests to arbitrary URLs."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to make requests to the application and manipulate the path parameter, which is typically controlled by the client. Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint or how to bypass it by using `__proto__` is also useful, but not strictly required."
