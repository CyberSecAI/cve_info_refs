SUMMARY

SIMATIC CN 4100 is vulnerable to authorization bypass through user-controlled key, use of default
credentials and unauthenticated IP address change that could allow an attacker to remotely login as root
or cause denial of service condition of the device.

Siemens has released a new version for SIMATIC CN 4100 and recommends to update to the latest
version.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-49251

The “intermediate installation” system state of the affected application allows an attacker to add their
own login credentials to the device. This allows an attacker to remotely login as root and take control
of the device even after the affected device is fully set up.

CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key

Vulnerability CVE-2023-49252

The affected application allows IP configuration change without authentication to the device. This
could allow an attacker to cause denial of service condition.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2023-49621

The “intermediate installation” system state of the affected application uses default credential with
admin privileges. An attacker could use the credentials to gain complete control of the affected device.
