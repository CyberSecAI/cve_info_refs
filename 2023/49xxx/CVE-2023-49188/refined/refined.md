- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Track Geolocation Of Users Using Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows malicious actors to inject scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts execute when users visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious activities like redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin by injecting malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's functionality, which could be achieved through the Contact Form 7 integration. The attacker does not require special privileges beyond that of being a user able to interact with the contact form. However, the execution of the scripts occurs on the browsers of other users visiting the affected site. The admin of the site must update to version 2.1 or later.
