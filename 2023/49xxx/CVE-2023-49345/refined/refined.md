- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The budgie-takeabreak applet stores data in a location accessible to any local user. The data file format is also easily guessable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure data storage, predictable file format.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can manipulate the displayed content by pre-creating the data file with arbitrary string content, or cause a denial of service (DoS) by placing a FIFO file, potentially crashing the entire budgie panel due to the applet running in the same thread.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create files in the vulnerable location.
