### Changelog LinOTP 3.4

#### **Breaking Changes:**

> * For the container, the `client=` HTTP POST parameter is deprecated
>   and disabled by default. It will be removed in an upcoming version
>   of LinOTP. It can be re-enabled if the
>   `GET\_CLIENT\_ADDRESS\_FROM\_POST\_DATA` config is set to a true value
>   (the default is "false", for security reasons). Only if re-enabled,
>   the "Authorization:" config on the "System config" dialog in the
>   web-based management UI is available again and `client=` parameters
>   are looked at.
> * default of `BACKUP\_DIR` is now /var/backups/linotp for the Debian
>   package
> * the CLI `linotp backup create` uses `BACKUP\_DIR` to save backups
>   instead of the current working directory
> * breaking changes to the `linotp audit cleanup` CLI:
>   + option `--no-export` is removed
>   + option `--export` is added to trigger the export
>   + export is disabled by default. Use `linotp audit cleanup
>     --export` to trigger it. This restores LinOTP 2.x behavior
>   + options `--min` and `--max` are removed. They are replaced by
>     `--max-entries-to-keep` and `--cleanup-threshold`:
>     - `--max-entries-to-keep` (default: 5000) specifies the number
>       of entries to be retained in the audit database.
>     - `--cleanup-threshold`: (optional) cleanup is only initiated
>       if the number of entries exceeds this threshold. Must be
>       greater than --max-entries-to-keep. No threshold is active
>       by default, i.e. technically speaking, this parameter is
>       equal to `--max-entries-to-keep` by default.

#### **Features:**

> * TRUSTED\_PROXIES config variable is added to configure LinOTPs proxy
>   trust. This config will override (i.e. disable) the trusted
>   forwarding proxy configuration in the manage ui -> system
>   configuration.
> * add option `--delete-after-days` to `linotp audit cleanup`: Delete
>   entries older than the given number of days (starting from the
>   beginning of the day). Can't be used alongside
>   `--max-entries-to-keep` or `--cleanup-threshold`!
> * improved debug log output for TOTP resync routine
> * improved (mostly by reducing) debug log output during server start
>   and request context.
> * reporting api change: If the `realms` parameter is omitted, the
>   realm `/:no realm:/` is now also evaluated.

#### **Fixes:**

> * when rolling out a forwarding token via /manage, the serial of the
>   target token is included in the description
> * faulty JWTs don't cause a `500 Internal Server Error` anymore and
>   the error gets logged properly
> * login and logout endpoint for admin authentication was mixed into
>   all /api/v2 controllers which made it possible to use e.g.
>   /api/v2/realms/login. Please use only /admin/{login/logout}
> * faulty policies (e.g. `totp\_hashlib=sha256`) now return and log a
>   meaningful error message
> * audit log entries for `/admin/login` and `admin/logout` now state
>   `success`, `user`, `realm` and `administrator` correctly
> * audit log entries for userservice API requests state the correct
>   `success` value
> * the last provider (of any kind) can now be deleted
> * non-default providers can be now be deleted as expected if and only
>   if they are not part of an authentication policy
> * audit log entries for `/userservice/logout` now state `user` and
>   `realm` correctly
> * Restored the `period` return attribute in the /reporting/period API
>   endpoint to resolve missing data issue.

### Changelog LinOTP SelfService 1.3.1

#### **Breaking Changes:**

> * verify warning is removed when a token is enrolled with successful
>   verification
> * users can login with, test and verify forwarding tokens targeting

The update 3.1.1 of LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance applies this patch, please ensure the update to this
version. Please contact the support team for assistance of the regular update or a download link to the
latest ISO installer.

For the upcoming container-based architecture, we have already updated FreeRadius to 3.2.5 and provide a new
container in our registry. Please contact us at **support@linotp.de** if you would like to be informed as soon
as the new container-based LinOTP Virtual Appliance is available or to get an early-adopter demo version

### Changelog LinOTP 3.3.1

#### **Fix:**

> * fix unbound variable in containers `entrypoint.sh`

### Changelog LinOTP 3.3

#### **Breaking Changes:**

> * Renamed the following config variables and some changed their defaults:
>
> + `LOGGING\_FILE\_LEVEL` -> `LOG\_FILE\_LEVEL`
> + default: `WARNING` -> `DEBUG`
> + `LOGGING\_CONSOLE\_LEVEL` -> `LOG\_CONSOLE\_LEVEL`
> + default: `WARNING` -> `DEBUG`
> + `LOGGING\_SQLALCHEMY\_LEVEL` -> `LOG\_LEVEL\_DB\_CLIENT`
> + `LOGGING` -> `LOG\_CONFIG`
>
> * default of `LOGGING\_LEVEL` changed from `INFO` to `WARNING`* when migrating from LinOTP 2.x, the audit log is no longer truncated to circumvent issues with
>     privileges in different database handlers. Old audit log entries that are not truncated now,
>     are reported to have a failing signature check because the method has changed with LinOTP version
>     3.0.

#### **Deprecations:**

> * In the future, config variable `LOGGING\_LEVEL` will be replaced by `LOG\_LEVEL`.
>   `LOG\_LEVEL` can and should be used from now on. `LOG\_LEVEL` defaults to `WARNING`.

>   + /api/v2/tokens
>     - accepts query parameters `userId` and `resolverName` to filter tokens by

> * new API endpoint to retrieve realms:
>   + /api/v2/realms
> * new API endpoint to retrieve users of a realm:
>   + /api/v2/realms/<realm\_name>/users
>     - accepts any field of a user as query parameter to filter by
>     - accepts query parameter `searchTerm` to filter users where one field matches the
>       given value
> * new API endpoint to retrieve resolvers:
>   + /api/v2/resolvers* new API endpoint to retrieve users of a resolver:
>     + /api/v2/resolvers/<resolver\_name>/users
>       - accepts any field of a user as query parameter to filter by
>       - accepts query parameter `searchTerm` to filter users where one field
>         matches the given value
>       - sortable by fields
>     + /api/v2/resolvers/<resolver\_name>/users/<user\_id>
>       - shows the single user info
>   * new API endpoint to retrieve AuditLog:
>     + /api/v2/auditlog

>     its session
>   * tokens can be imported as disabled tokens
>   * when triggering a challenge, the token description is returned to help identify the token
>   * password token now supports the 'onetime' parameter as the former SPASS token type did
>   * added validation for policy actions. The validation is based on the policy definitions and saving a
>     policy with an invalid action is rejected
>   * policies detail\_on\_success and detail\_on\_fail apply to all /validate endpoints
>   * /validate endpoints return user information (e.g. given name, phone) when detail\_on\_success is set
>   * /userservice/context now returns whether usage timestamp logging is enabled in LinOTP
>   * improved audit log messages for /admin/ API
>   * support for MySQL databases that are run with lower\_case\_table\_names=1 (default on Windows)

#### **Fixes:**

> * Removed: LinOTP no longer supports truncated transaction ids or checking partial transaction id
>   matches
> * Upon user logout, admin sessions weren't properly invalidated, allowing to re-use JWTs of logged-out
>   users
> * when using pagination, /admin/userlist would not return the last user of the page,
>   if the list of users for that page is greater or equal to the value of `rp` (default: 16)
> * forward token with an empty pin now supports forwarding to push tokens (was broken since 3.2.4)
> * filtering for active/inactive token works correctly
> * legacy selfservice qr and push token enrollment breaks with strings in otppin policy
> * legacy selfservice customisation not working in login screen
> * drop ability to define autoassignment policy with values, it is now only acting as a boolean policy
> * an admin could use `reporting/delete\_before` for realms they did not have access to
> * AdminController and UserserviceController did trigger reporting on unauthorized requests
> * AdminController was not triggering reporting for the correct realms in some circumstances
> * UserserviceController was not triggering reporting for the correct realms in some circumstances
> * requests to userservice API are logging the username in the audit-log instead of the User-Object
> * replace deprecated `DATA\_DIR` with `CACHE\_DIR`. Mako template cache now uses `CACHE\_DIR`.
> * trim excessive error logging when accessing `/static` files without a valid session

### Changelog LinOTP SelfService 1.2

> * Users get warned and have to confirm their action, if that action would prevent them from logging
>   into Selfservice.
> * Display number of enrolled tokens.
> * Display the number of remaining tokens that the user is still allowed to enroll.
> * Users are prevented from enrolling a token, if the token limit has been reached. They're informed
>   instead.

2023-12-19

> **Disclaimer:**
>
> LinOTP core authentication checks are not directly affected. The
> validation of logins using the LinOTP core API, including all LinOTP
> Authentication Modules are not directly affected. This includes all
> protocols (SAML, RADIUS, LDAP, ), and authentication frontends (i.e.
> LinOTP Authentication Provider, ADFS) which are not directly affected by
> this advisory.

## Description

Due to an error in the multi-threading safety mechanism in the LinOTP
3 Self Service login, the session check data of a user can be overwritten
with the session data of another, concurrent user. This leads to possible
information disclosure (username, e-mail, phone number) and allows to act
as and with the permissions of the attacked user in the LinOTP 3 Self
Service.

This vulnerability could enable unauthorized access
without the need for valid credentials. In specific situations, it might
be possible to target an individual user. However, any unauthorized
access attempts by a malicious entity would only be possible if another
user is actively engaged in the self-service portal at the same time. It
is important to note that previously expired sessions cannot be exploited
in this context.

We currently have no evidence indicating that the identified
vulnerability has been exploited.

A customer initially reported a display bug with the Self Service.
After further investigations, the LinOTP team was able to identify a related vulnerability and assess its
severity. We developed a fix while analyzing the behavior which is
provided with this update. Other parts of LinOTP beyond the Self Service
were analyzed. No additional occurrence of this implementation pattern
was found. The administrative login implemented with LinOTP 3 is not
affected.

The provided update to LinOTP 3.2.5 completely fixes this
vulnerability. All customers running LinOTP 3 up to version 3.2.4 are
strongly advised to install the newest version LinOTP 3.2.5 as soon as
possible.

We are providing LinOTP 3.2.5 as a regular update for
LinOTP SVA and as native packages for LinOTP 3.2.4 and older (Debian).
Please refer to the installation instructions for the correct steps in
your environment:
[**Installation Instructions**](https://linotp.org/resources/linotp-3-2-5-update-instructions.html)

Customers can contact support@linotp.de if you have any questions
about the update. We are happy to assist directly and execute the update
together with you, tailored to your environment.

## Preventive actions

A complete fix of the vulnerability needs the installation of the
provided update. If you can not install the update in a fitting time
frame we provide some preventive actions.

Deactivating all active policies in the scope „selfservice“ will
remove all permissions for all users. This will prevent a possible misuse
until the update can be installed. Please note, regular users will also
not be able to configure their tokens, until the policies are
reactivated.

Deactivating the „userservice“ backend and the Self
Service completely
is advised if you cannot update for some time. Please contact
support@linotp.de, we are happy to assist in deactivating the backend in
the LinOTP configuration.

### Important Measures

LinOTP 3 Self Service checks the user and the client IP of the
session. A common scenario for LinOTP 3 Self Service is running a proxy
or load balancer between the client and the LinOTP backend. Oversight to
configure the forwarding of the client IP to LinOTP in this scenario,
increases the possibility of the race condition in this advisory to
occur, since the clients IP is not contributing to distinguish the
session. Please refer to [1.12.4.
System Config — LinOTP 3.2 documentation](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/system-config.html#tab-client-identification)
for details. This is independent of the current update.

We understand that this process may be inconvenient, and our technical support team is here to assist our
customers.

## [LinOTP 3 released](./linotp-3.html)

On July 15th we released LinOTP 3.2, the first stable release of LinOTP 3.

# LinOTP 3.2

[**netgo software GmbH**](https://linotp.de)
is pleased to announce the availability of the
following product release:

LinOTP 3.2 brings many improvements, new features and bugfixes. The following list contains the
most important changes to LinOTP 2.

* See the [**full changelog**](resources/changelogs.html) of LinOTP 3.0, LinOTP 3.1, and
  LinOTP 3.2 for more details and the full list of changes and deprecations.
* See the [**migration guide**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/3.2/part-installation/migration/23.html)
  in the LinOTP documentation for more details for your upcoming install of LinOTP 3.

## Highlights:

* **Python 3 & Flask**: LinOTP 3 is based on Python 3 and the main framework was ported from Pylons to
  Flask to future proof the foundation.
* **New Selfservice**: LinOTP 3 ships with a completely new Token Selfservice user interface.
* **Administrative Login**: LinOTP 3 ships with a brand new JWT based admin authentication for the
  Management UI and the administrative APIs.

#### New Selfservice

* It completely overhauls the workflow for users to self-manage their own authentication tokens. The new
  selfservice is installed as a dependency of the LinOTP package.
* The new selfservice integrates itself into the apache configuration on installation and is the default
  selfservice of your LinOTP server.
* The SelfService design from LinOTP 2 is deprecated but still available under it’s own path
  /selfservice-legacy. You can change the apache configuration to change the default.
* Footer texts and links to your privacy and imprint informations can be configured by LinOTP policies. The
  logo image can be changed and the CSS rules can be customized.
* The new Selfservice supports the workflow of users testing their tokens after enrollment. This verifies
  the correct functionality of the token and eases future debugging login problems.

#### Administrative Login

* LinOTP 3 ships with a brand new JWT based admin authentication for the Management UI and the
  administrative APIs.
* It is no longer necessary to configure apache to protect admin access
* LinOTP 3 no longer uses digest authentication.
* LinOTP Administrators are now configured in LinOTP itself. Administrators can be configured using the
  `linotp` CLI command for bootstraping or automation or graphically using the known UserIDResolvers and
  Realms.
* The internal administration allows an improved handling of admin policies and permissions based on groups
  and resolvers

#### Configuration Files

* To facilitate the migration to flask and to improve the handling of configuration files in modern
  environments, LinOTP 3 no longer supports the linotp.ini configuration file format. Instead, a new
  linotp.cfg file format is in place. See the migration guide for detailed information about the configuration
  changes.

#### General Improvements

* Managed resolvers (Internally stored users) that are managed via "Import users" in the Manage-UI now work
  with replicated databases, high-availability setups and if restored from database backups.
* A new 'linotp' CLI replaces different scripts and tools. This improves the integration and feature set of
  all CLI scenarios. It also provides new features to administrate different parts of LinOTP. See 'linotp
  --help' for information about the different sub-command groups.
* The audit trail can now be used with an sqlite database. Note that sqlite still has concurency limitations
  and we advise you to use a database server for production environments.
* 'Cross site scripting request forgery (CSRF)' is no longer handled via the session request parameter. The
  session parameter that was used before should be omitted. API endpoints that are modifying data are
  restricted to accept only 'POST' requests and must use the new header. See the Migration guide for further
  details.
* All providers allow configuring a TIMEOUT parameter.
* SMS blocking time is now configurable in the SMS token configuration dialog. The blocking time (in
  seconds) is the period that needs to pass before another challenge can be triggered by the same user.
* Improved handling of timestamps in logs and reports. The audit trail is now storing ISO 8601 formatted
  timestamps in UTC timezone instead of server local time.
* LinOTP 3 now fully relies on the system trusted certificates for TLS security like it is used with LDAP
  resolvers.
* Improved handling of encrypted LDAP resolver connections.
* Specific policies override wildcard policies. This ensures that actions can be restricted for a subset of
  users.
* Improved token monitoring and more precise token counting
* Improved audit log entries
* Improved integration of supported databases
* LinOTP 3 supports reencoding of LinOTP 2 databases from ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) to UTF-8 via the LinOTP CLI.
  Latin1 used to be the default for Python 2 against mysql but is no longer valid for Python 3. The
  'linotp.log' will instruct users on how to use the migration command if necessary. The LinOTP Smart Virtual
  Appliance (SVA 3.0) will automatically apply the reencoding during the restore setup.

## Download

LinOTP 3.2 is available as a Debian package from
[**www.linotp.org**](https://www.linotp.org/download.html).

Users with a support and subscription license can migrate to the new LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance in version
3.0. An SVA installer ISO download link can be requested from the support team.

## [LinOTP hotfix and advisory](./linotp-hotfix-autoresync.html)

# LinOTP hotfix and security advisory

KeyIdentity GmbH announces a critical vulnerability in LinOTP.
[CVE-2019-12887](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12887) was published
for this vulnerability.

KeyIdentity GmbH recommends to apply the hotfix described below for a secure operation of LinOTP if the
conditions apply.

The vulnerability is relevant if you are using TOTP (time based OATH HMAC) token and enabled the auto
resynchronization feature. Automatic resynchronization is inactive by default after installation.

With activated resynchronization it is possible to successfully log in using an OTP value recorded earlier.

The hotfix prevents this attack vector.

If you cannot update or patch immediately and have automatic resynchronization activated with TOTP token, you
should **deactivate the automatic resynchronization** until you can update. We provide
[a configuration guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-disable-autosync.html).

We explicitly thank Sébastien Foutrel for his diagnostics and valuable report for this vulnerability.

### Installation

We provide packages in different formats and versions. These packages do not contain changes beyond the hotfix
for this issue.

KeyIdentity provides an [installation guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-hotfix-autoresync.html)
with download links for all available packages.

### Available Packages

2.10.5.2 updated to 2.10.5.3 (Debian Jessie, Debian Stretch, RPM)

2.9.3.4 updated to 2.9.3.5 (Debian Jessie)

2.8.1.7 updated to 2.8.1.8 (Debian Jessie)

### All versions of LinOTP

If you are using an older version of LinOTP (<2.8) or cannot immediately install
the packages provided, we also provide a patch file with
a [patch guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-hotfix-autoresync.html)

### KeyIdentity LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance

Customers using the LinOTP SVA will receive the update when automatic updates are activated. We recommend until
your scheduled automatic update to deactivate the automatic resynchronization if enabled, used with TOTP token and
you can not apply the immediate updates described above. We offer a [configuration guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-disable-autosync.html).

If you have questions about applying the hotfix, we are happy to assist you:

## [KeyIdentity LinOTP 2.10 released](./linotp-2.10.html)

On January 15th we released LinOTP 2.10 to the repositories.

# LinOTP 2.10

[**KeyIdentity GmbH**](https://keyidentity.com)
is pleased to announce the availability of the
following product release:

LinOTP 2.10 introduces many improvements, new features, cleanups and bug fixes.
The list below provides details of the most important changes. Please also
refer to the complete changelog at the end of this newsletter.

## Highlights

* **New Feature: Voice Token**

LinOTP 2.10 is the first release to include support for Voice
Tokens. Thus, in addition to the already known challenge response token (e.g.
KeyIdentity's Push Token, SMS Token), provides another barrier-free possibility
to deliver OTP to users.

Currently Twilio is supported as Voice Token Provider. The Voice Token requies
a dedicated Voice Challenge Service which is made available to customers by
KeyIdentity GmbH. Documentation for the Voice Token can be found here:
 [**Voice Token**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/voiceprovider.html).

Details about the Voice Challenge Service can be obtained from **support@keyidentity.com**.

* **New Feature: Securing the Selfservice Portal with MFA**

The Selfservice Portal can be additionally protected with MFA. This is
particularly useful for environments where the Selfservice Portal stands
exposed to the Internet. The MFA feature is configureable and allows the
retention of existing workflows with addtional security.

Details can be found here:
 [**MFA Selfservice
Portal**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/policy/selfservice.html).

* **Improvements: KeyIdentity Push Token**

LinOTP 2.10 improves the functionality of KeyIdentity's Push Token. A dedicated
Challenge Service is introduced. This service allows the separation of the
external communication with the user's mobile and the sensitive data stored in
LinOTP. The updated KeyIdentity Authenticator Apps for iOS and Android can now
actively query existing challenges of the user. Thus makes transaction
validation more reliable. The Challenge Service and comprehensive
documentation are provided by the [**KeyIdentity GmbH**](https://keyidentity.com) and can be
obtained from
**support@keyidentity.com**.

* **Token Validity**

Number of uses and the expiry date of tokens can be limited. Starting with
LinOTP 2.10 these limits can be configured conveniently via WEB GUI (token
management) - e.g. by the help desk personnel. This is useful, for example, to
enroll temporary tokens for visitors. More information can be found here:
 [**Token
Validity**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/managingtokens/manage.html#set-expiration).

## Download

LinOTP 2.10 is available as Debian and RPM packages from
[**www.linotp.org**](https://www.linotp.org/download.html).
Ubuntu packages are available from our PPA on Launchpad.
Users of the KeyIdentity LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance will receive
LinOTP 2.10 via the integrated auto-update mechanism.

## [KeyIdentity LinOTP 2.9.1 released](./linotp-2.9.1.html)

On February 15th we released LinOTP 2.9.1 to the repositories.

# LinOTP 2.9.1

[**KeyIdentity GmbH**](https://keyidentity.com)
is pleased to announce the availability of the
following product release:

LinOTP 2.9.1 introduces many improvements, small features,
cleanups and bug fixes. The highlights are the implementation of
the KeyIdentity Push Token, a new caching functionality to
significantly speed up performance for UserIdResolvers and the
switch to StartTLS by default to improve the connection security to
LDAP UserIdResolvers.

The list below provides details of the most important changes.
Please also refer to the complete changelog at the end of this
newsletter

## Highlights

* **New Feature: KeyIdentity Push Token**

LinOTP 2.9.1 is the first release to include support for the
KeyIdentity Push Token to secure logins and transactions while
providing a high level of usability on Android and iOS.

Based on the established cryptographic principles of the QRToken we
improved the workflows of the authentication process while
conserving a high level of security. It utilizes the native push
mechanisms of Android and iOS for the highest level of
compatibility based on the KeyIdentity Authenticator.

Please contact us for more information and about details on how to
integrate the KeyIdentity Push Token in your setup.

* **New Feature: Caching for LDAP UserIdResolvers**

The new caching feature is designed to improve the performance of
LinOTP significantly in environments with a large number of users,
complex realm setups and slow UserIdResolvers. Details about the
configuration can be found at
[**Caching-Feature**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/system-config.html#tab-caching).

* **New Feature: StartTLS by default**

LinOTP 2.9.1 switches to StartTLS by default in order to secure
the communication with LDAP UserIdResolvers in environments without
a LDAPS infrastructure. Please have a look at
[**StartTLS**](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/manageclient/useridresolver.html#configuring-ldap-useridresolver)
for details.

## Download

LinOTP 2.9.1 is available as Debian and RPM packages from
[**www.linotp.org**](https://www.linotp.org/download.html).
Ubuntu packages are available from our PPA on Launchpad.
Users of the KeyIdentity LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance will receive
LinOTP 2.9.1 via the integrated auto-update mechanism after
February 20th 2017.

## Note

With LinOTP 2.9.1 large parts of the LDAP
UserIdResolver code was rewritten and the default for StartTLS have
changed. Although LinOTP 2.9.1 has been tested thoroughly by
KeyIdentity we recommend to setup LinOTP 2.9.1 in a staging
environment before putting it into production.

We are happy to assist our support customers in upgrading their
environment to the latest release. Please contact us at
**keyidentity@keyidentity.com**.

## [Hackathon 2FA](./hackathon_2016.html)

Wissenschaft und Praxis zeigen: Passwörter taugen nichts! Im Gegenteil, sie
stellen eine der Hauptursachen für die erfolgreiche Kompromittierung von
Benutzerkonten oder ganzen Systemen dar. Benutzer wählen oft schwache
Passwörter, Cracker greifen komplette Benutzer-Datenbanken ab, die
möglicherweise gar nicht oder ungeschickt verschlüsselte Passwörter enthalten,
und Schadsoftware, die auch das beste Passwort mitschneidet, wird immer
ausgefeilter. Auch Phishing, vor allem gezieltes „Spear-Phishing“, ist ein
großes Problem in der Praxis.

Unsere Antwort bei der [KeyIdentity GmbH](https://keyidentity.com) ist
LinOTP. LinOTP ([https://linotp.org](https://www.linotp.org/)) ist
eine leistungsfähige und flexible Open-Source-Lösung für
Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung, mit der traditionelle Passwörter durch weitere
Mechanismen ersetzt oder ergänzt werden können. Dazu gehören zum Beispiel
Hardware-Tokens oder Authentifizierungslösungen auf der Basis von mobilen Apps.
LinOTP bietet ein bequemes API zur Integration in
existierende Applikationen.

Wir wissen: Authentifizierung muss sicherer werden. Aus diesem Grund
veranstalten wir einen Hackathon, bei dem Ihr mit LinOTP die Sicherheit Eurer
Applikationen erhöhen könnt. Vernetzt Euch mit anderen, und lasst uns gemeinsam
unsere Applikationen sicherer machen und das Paradigma „Such Dir ein möglichst
komplexes Passwort, das Du Dir nicht merken kannst, und schreib es nirgends
auf“ brechen.

Wir laden am **3.12.2016** zu uns in die Räumlichkeiten der KeyIdentity GmbH in
Weiterstadt ein, stellen Pizza und Getränke und helfen euch dabei, LinOTP über
die API in Eure Software zu integrieren.

Lernt, wie einfach es ist, Eure Applikationen abzusichern, erhaltet freie
Hilfe, vernetzt Euch untereinander und habt einfach einen tollen Tag!
Zur besseren Planung bitten wir um eine Anmeldung via E-Mail unter:

## [LSE LinOTP 2.8.1 released](./linotp-2.8.1.html)

On Apr 5th we released LinOTP 2.8.1 to the repositories.

# LinOTP 2.8.1

LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH is introducing LinOTP 2.8.1,
the latest
version of its vendor independent solution for adaptive
multi-factor and
2-factor authentication and OTP processes (OTP: one time
passwords). LSE is now
offering its latest LinOTP version in Spanish, French, Italian, and
simplified
Chinese in addition to the previously available English and German.
In addition
to the expanded available languages, LinOTP 2.8.1 has new features
for
monitoring and improved capabilities for server migration and
complex setups.
The improved user filters and support for HSM (hardware security
module)
migrations are also new. With the additional languages, LSE has
consistently
continued to internationalise the LinOTP product line. The larger
selection of
available languages applies to both the self-service user portal as
well as the
management interfaces.

## Highlights:

* **New Feature: Additional Languages**

LSE has consistently continued to internationalise the LinOTP
product line. The
larger selection of available languages applies to both the
self-service user
portal as well as the management interfaces.

* **New Feature: Monitoring**

LSE is introducing a new API for monitoring internal LinOTP
processes with
LinOTP 2.8.1. This provides, for example, information on the
statistics and the
status of the tokens, the status of the HSM (hardware security
module)
encoding, and the status of the UserIDResolver with configurable
permissions.

* **New Feature: Improved User Filters**

Today's enterprise environments require a differentiated
approach to user
policy management. LinOTP 2.8.1 adds options for managing the
configurations
and policies based on user groups, user attributes, and regular
expressions.
This considerably simplifies detailed and complex permission
scenarios in the
setup.

* **New Feature: SMPPSMSProvider**

LinOTP now supports SMPP protocol for submitting text messages
to Short
Message Service centers (SMSC).

* **New Feature: Improved Features for Server Migration and
  Complex Setups**

Previous features for routing registration data to other
authentication servers
have been improved with options for generic routing. This means
migration
scenarios and complex setups with multiple LinOTP instances are
easier to model
and administer.

In addition to these features, LinOTP 2.8.1 includes many
further improvements
and bug fixes in order to improve the user experience.

## Download

LinOTP 2.8.1 is available as a Debian package from linotp.org.
Ubuntu packages
are available from our PPA on Launchpad. It can also be obtained
via the Python
Package Index (PyPI). Users of the LSE LinOTP Smart Virtual
Appliance will
receive LinOTP 2.8.1 via the integrated update mechanism.

have about LinOTP
2.8.1 and assist upgrading your environment to the latest release

## [LSE LinOTP 2.8 released](./linotp-2.8.html)

On Nov 27th we released LinOTP 2.8 to the repositories.

# LinOTP 2.8

LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH is pleased to announce the
availability of
the following product release:

LinOTP 2.8 contains full support for the FIDO U2F standard,
along with
additional new features, usability improvements and bug fixes.

The list below provides details of the most important changes.
The complete
changelog is provided at the end of this article.

## Highlights:

* New feature: FIDO U2F support

> LinOTP 2.8 now fully supports the FIDO alliance U2F protocol.
> It is now
> possible to use user friendly U2F tokens provided by various
> manufacturers in
> order to implement the second authentication factor. By using
> public key
> techniques, It is now possible to use just one token to access
> multiple
> authentication systems. In addition, it is possible to
> implement Bring Your
> Own Token (BYOT) scenarios.

* New feature: User enrollment of FIDO U2F, email and SMS
  tokens via the self
  service portal

> In order to simplify the rollout process, it is now possible to
> allow users to
> use the self service portal to enroll new token types (FIDO
> U2F, email and SMS)
> in addition to those previously available. As with other token
> types, access to
> these new types is under the control of the LinOTP
> administrator via the policy
> system.

* New feature: Temporary email and SMS token

> If a token is lost or stolen, it is now possible to define a
> temporary email or
> SMS token instead of a temporary password.

* New feature: More than one challenge response token per
  user with identical
  token PIN

> The API in LinOTP 2.8 supports generation of more than one
> challenge for
> various tokens and token types. This now makes it possible to
> use different
> challenge response tokens with the same token PIN. It is also
> possible to use
> different challenge response token types with identical token
> PINs.

* Improvements and bug fixes

In addition to these features, LinOTP 2.8 includes many further
improvements
and bug fixes in order to improve the user experience.

## [LSE LinOTP Hotfix / Security Advisory](./linotp-hotfix-flexigrid.html)

LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH recommend the application of the hotfix described
below in oder to ensure secure operation with LinOTP. It is only necessary
to carry out these steps on those installations which do not use automatic
update mechanisms (see below under "LSE LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance"). Users
of automatic update mechansims are not affected, as LinOTP will already have been
updated.

The hotfix closes a critical issue and prevents potential misuse.

This issue can potentially allow an unauthorised user to submit input containing
unwanted characters, that is written to LinOTP's logs and database. At a later
date under certian conditions, it is possible that these could be executed under
admin context. It is possible that malicious code could be exected as a result. This
is due to unescaped output being passed to a widget used by LinOTP.

[A security advisory has been released](https://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2015-11-06.txt) for
our
product LinOTP containing further
details. We would especially like to thank Tomas Rzepka for his valued input
and assistance.

As far as we are aware, there have not been any cases of this issue being exploited.

We have provided the hotfix to our customer in various formats and versions. The
fixed packages do not contain any changes apart from the hotfix itself. We recommend
applying this update as soon as possible.

Please use the instructions provided below to install the hotfix.

In future versions of LinOTP (2.8 and above), we will make changes to reduce the
potential risk of similar issues through use of the API.

### Hotfix installation

The following updated LinOTP versions are available:

* 2.6.1.1 --> 2.6.1.2
* 2.7.0.2 --> 2.7.0.3
* 2.7.1.2 --> 2.7.1.3
* 2.7.2.1 --> 2.7.2.2

Systems prior to LinOTP 2.6 or which do not use packages should refer to the
installation instructions. In this case the fix should be applied by manually
copying a fixed version of the file in question.

#### LSE LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance

Customers who use the LinOTP SVA with automatic updates enabled will
automatically obtain the new package when updates are applied according to
their system configuration.

It is possible to start the update process from the command line by executing
the command "appliance-update.sh".

Please note: appliance-update.sh will download and apply all pending operating
system updates. If your system has not been updated for some time, this may
result in a lengthy download and installation process.

# Security Update for LinOTP 3 - CVE-2023-49706
CVE Identifier: CVE-2023-49706
Product: LinOTP 3 SelfService
Issue Date: 2023-12-18
Criticality (CVSS 3.1): 7.5 (high)
Publisher: netgo software GmbH - LinOTP Team

# CVE-2023-49706: LinOTP 3 Self Service issue in session security
## Description
An issue with the LinOTP 3 Self Service login's request context safety
mechanism can cause a user's session data to be mistakenly replaced with that
of another user who is logged in at the same time. This error could potentially
reveal personal information (like username, email, and phone number) and allow
one user to access and operate with the permissions of another within the
LinOTP 3 Self Service.
## Affected Products
\* LinOTP 3 on native installations with all versions from LinOTP 3.0 up to LinOTP 3.2.4
\* LinOTP Virtual Appliance with LinOTP 3.0 and above (Installations based on
SVA 3.0 and higher need to update to LinOTP 3.2.5 and newer)
## Unaffected Products
\* LinOTP 2 up to and including the current 2.12.6 is \*\*not\*\* affected.
\* LinOTP ADFS Plugin is \*\*not\*\* affected
\* LinOTP LAP is \*\*not\*\* affected
\* LinOTP SAML IdP, LinOTP RADIUS Authentication Module, LinOTP LDAP
Authentication Module are \*\*not\*\*affected.
\* LinOTP Virtual Appliance itself is \*\*not\*\* affected.
## Criticality
We are currently calculating with a CVSS 3.1 score of 7.5 (high)
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M).
## Date of Publication
2023-12-18
| \*Disclaimer:\* LinOTP core authentication checks are not directly affected.
| The validation of logins using the LinOTP core API, including all LinOTP
| Authentication Modules are not directly affected. This includes all protocols
| (SAML, RADIUS, LDAP, ), and authentication frontends (i.e. LinOTP
| Authentication Provider, ADFS) which are not directly affected by this
| advisory.
## Description
Due to an error in the multi-threading safety mechanism in the LinOTP 3 Self
Service login, the session check data of a user can be overwritten with the
session data of another, concurrent user. This leads to possible information
disclosure (username, e-mail, phone number) and allows to act as and with the
permissions of the attacked user in the LinOTP 3 Self Service. This
vulnerability could enable unauthorized access without the need for valid
credentials. In specific situations, it might be possible to target an
individual user. However, any unauthorized access attempts by a malicious
entity would only be possible if another user is actively engaged in the
self-service portal at the same time. It is important to note that previously
expired sessions cannot be exploited in this context.
As of now, there's no evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited.
It was initially reported as a display bug by a customer, leading to its
discovery and subsequent fix in the LinOTP 3.2.5 update. The vulnerability is
limited to the Self Service component; other LinOTP components, including the
administrative login, are unaffected.
Organisations using LinOTP 3 versions up to and including 3.2.4 should urgently
upgrade to version 3.2.5. This update, available for LinOTP SVA and as native
packages, can be accessed through the provided installation instructions.
(https://linotp.org/resources/linotp-3-2-5-update-instructions.html)
Customers can contact support for assistance.
If an immediate update is not possible, it is recommended to deactivate all
"selfservice" policies or even the "userservice" backend to prevent misuse.
Note: When using LinOTP 3 Self Service with a proxy or load balancer, ensuring
proper client IP forwarding is crucial to avoid exacerbating this
vulnerability. Details can be found in the LinOTP 3.2 System Config
documentation.

## Description

Due to an error in the multi-threading safety mechanism in the LinOTP
3 Self Service login, the session check data of a user can be overwritten
with the session data of another, concurrent user. This leads to possible
information disclosure (username, e-mail, phone number) and allows to act
as and with the permissions of the attacked user in the LinOTP 3 Self
Service.

This vulnerability could enable unauthorized access
without the need for valid credentials. In specific situations, it might
be possible to target an individual user. However, any unauthorized
access attempts by a malicious entity would only be possible if another
user is actively engaged in the self-service portal at the same time. It
is important to note that previously expired sessions cannot be exploited
in this context.

We currently have no evidence indicating that the identified
vulnerability has been exploited.

A customer initially reported a display bug with the Self Service.
After further investigations, the LinOTP team was able to identify a related vulnerability and assess its
severity. We developed a fix while analyzing the behavior which is
provided with this update. Other parts of LinOTP beyond the Self Service
were analyzed. No additional occurrence of this implementation pattern
was found. The administrative login implemented with LinOTP 3 is not
affected.

The provided update to LinOTP 3.2.5 completely fixes this
vulnerability. All customers running LinOTP 3 up to version 3.2.4 are
strongly advised to install the newest version LinOTP 3.2.5 as soon as
possible.

We are providing LinOTP 3.2.5 as a regular update for
LinOTP SVA and as native packages for LinOTP 3.2.4 and older (Debian).
Please refer to the installation instructions for the correct steps in
your environment:
[**Installation Instructions**](https://linotp.org/resources/linotp-3-2-5-update-instructions.html)

Customers can contact support@linotp.de if you have any questions
about the update. We are happy to assist directly and execute the update
together with you, tailored to your environment.

## Preventive actions

A complete fix of the vulnerability needs the installation of the
provided update. If you can not install the update in a fitting time
frame we provide some preventive actions.

Deactivating all active policies in the scope „selfservice“ will
remove all permissions for all users. This will prevent a possible misuse
until the update can be installed. Please note, regular users will also
not be able to configure their tokens, until the policies are
reactivated.

Deactivating the „userservice“ backend and the Self
Service completely
is advised if you cannot update for some time. Please contact
support@linotp.de, we are happy to assist in deactivating the backend in
the LinOTP configuration.

### Important Measures

LinOTP 3 Self Service checks the user and the client IP of the
session. A common scenario for LinOTP 3 Self Service is running a proxy
or load balancer between the client and the LinOTP backend. Oversight to
configure the forwarding of the client IP to LinOTP in this scenario,
increases the possibility of the race condition in this advisory to
occur, since the clients IP is not contributing to distinguish the
session. Please refer to [1.12.4.
System Config — LinOTP 3.2 documentation](https://www.linotp.org/doc/latest/part-management/system-config.html#tab-client-identification)
for details. This is independent of the current update.

We understand that this process may be inconvenient, and our technical support team is here to assist our
customers.
