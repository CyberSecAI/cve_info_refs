**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Atlassian Companion App for MacOS has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass its blocklist and the MacOS Gatekeeper using WebSockets, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of WebSocket connections, allowing bypass of the application's blocklist and MacOS Gatekeeper.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system where the Atlassian Companion App is installed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the use of WebSockets.
- The attacker must be able to establish a WebSocket connection to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a WebSocket connection with the vulnerable application.
- No specific user privileges are required.
- User interaction is required to establish a connection, so the attack vector would be through a malicious website.

**Affected versions:**
- All versions of Atlassian Companion App for MacOS up to but not including 2.0.0

**Fixed versions:**
- Atlassian Companion App for MacOS 2.0.0 and later.

**Additional notes:**
- The Atlassian Companion App for Windows is not affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability only affects the Atlassian Companion App, not Confluence Data Center, Server, or Cloud sites.
- The application auto-updates, but Atlassian recommends users verify the version installed.
- If users cannot update to a fixed version, uninstalling the application mitigates the vulnerability.
