- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A polynomial time complexity issue exists in the `handle_pointy_brace` function within `cmark-gfm`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The core vulnerability is a polynomial time complexity, specifically quadratic, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to unbounded resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific input string. The provided example uses a python command to generate a long string of `</` followed by `<!--` repeated multiple times. This crafted input when processed by `cmark-gfm` will lead to the quadratic time complexity issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input to the `cmark-gfm` parser.
