- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of active debug code in the OMRON CP1L-EL20DR-D PLC. This debug code allows for the execution of commands not specified in the FINS protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the existence of active debug code (CWE-489) that can be leveraged to bypass normal access controls. This can lead to the execution of unauthorized commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read and write to arbitrary areas of the device memory. This can result in:
    - Overwriting the firmware
    - Causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition
    - Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the affected PLC device and does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
