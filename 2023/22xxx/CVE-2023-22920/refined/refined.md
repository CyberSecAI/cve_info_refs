- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A security misconfiguration in the factory default settings of the affected devices. This misconfiguration was intended for testing purposes but was inadvertently included in the released firmware.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Security misconfiguration leading to an open Telnet service.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could gain unauthorized access to the affected device via Telnet.

- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the device on the network using Telnet.
