Vulnerability Correction in CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS)

■ Overview
Contec has identified several vulnerabilities in its CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) Web

HMI/SCADA software. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by a malicious attacker to

steal or tamper with data or to execute malicious programs that could result in the

destruction of the system.

The products affected by these vulnerabilities and the countermeasures/workarounds are

listed below. Please implement the appropriate countermeasures or workarounds as soon

as possible.

■ Affected products
Model：  CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS)
Version：  (1) Less than Ver.3.4.5

(2) to (5) Less than Ver.3.5.0

■ The vulnerability and its threat
[JVNVU#96873821]

(1)  CVE-2022-44456: “CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) OS command injection

vulnerability”

This vulnerability makes it possible for OS execution commands to be input from the

network continuity confirmation screen. These commands could then be used by a

malicious attacker to steal or tamper with information, destroy the system, or execute

malicious programs.

(2)  CVE-2023-22331: “CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) authentication failure

vulnerability”

CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) is designed to use a common account (user

name/password) immediately after installation. If this account setting is left unchanged,

this vulnerability could be used by a malicious attacker to alter the authentication

information.

(3)  CVE-2023-22334: “CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) information leakage vulnerability”

Because the authentication information for CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) is hashed

but unencrypted, this vulnerability could be used by a malicious attacker to steal

authentication information.

(4)  CVE-2023-22373: “Incomplete CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) JavaScript code

deactivation process”

Due to an incomplete JavaScript code deactivation process in CONPROSYS HMI

System (CHS), a malicious attacker could use page editing tools to steal cookies and

authentication information stored in the Web browser being used.

(5)  CVE-2023-22339: “CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) improper access control

vulnerability”

Site certificates used for HTTPS authentication are accessible from the Web. This

vulnerability could be used by a malicious attacker to eavesdrop on CONPROSYS HMI

System (CHS) communications operating on a different HTTPS.

■ Fix Version
By installing the latest version (less than ver.3.5.0) on CONTEC's website, the above

vulnerabilities can be fixed.

■ Workarounds
For customers unable to update to the latest version, Contec recommends the following

workarounds to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities by an attacker.

[Workarounds for vulnerabilities (1) through (5)]

- Set up a firewall at an upstream location in the network where the product is being used.

- Limit network access for this product to a reliable closed network.

[Additional workarounds for specific vulnerabilities]
  (2) After installation, log in to each project using the admin/demo account and change the

default password.

  (3) Change the settings so that connections use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

  (5) Stop using the included site certificate and create a new site certificate for use.

When renewing the site certificate, save it in a location that cannot be accessed from

the Web.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
