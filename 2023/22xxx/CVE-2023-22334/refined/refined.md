Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22334:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) stores authentication information using a hash instead of encryption.

**Weakness:** Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication (CWE-836). The authentication information is hashed but not encrypted.

**Impact:**
*   A malicious attacker can steal the hashed authentication information.
*   This stolen information can be used in a man-in-the-middle attack to potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attack.
*   Man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user and the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS).
*   The attacker needs some level of network access to be able to perform the man-in-the-middle attack.
*   An attacker would need to be able to intercept network communication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) versions 3.4.5 and earlier.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 5.3 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.5.0 and later.
*   A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is to switch from using HTTP to HTTPS connections
