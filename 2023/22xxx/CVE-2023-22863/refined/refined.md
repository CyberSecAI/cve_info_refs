- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Robotic Process Automation defaults to HTTP in some RPA commands when the prefix is not explicitly specified in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure default to HTTP for URL requests, leading to man-in-the-middle vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain sensitive information by intercepting communications using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the vulnerable system and the target server to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
