- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'sendemail' REST API endpoint in Splunk Enterprise did not properly validate permissions, allowing any authenticated user to send emails as the Splunk instance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient permissions validation on the 'sendemail' REST API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker could send emails as the Splunk instance. This could be used for phishing attacks, social engineering, or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Splunk Enterprise instance and access to the 'sendemail' REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Splunk Enterprise instance with access to the affected API endpoint.
