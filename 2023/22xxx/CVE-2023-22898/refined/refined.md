Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the possibility of a "zip bomb" or similar archive-based denial-of-service attack. The code was previously vulnerable to processing archives with excessive recursion or a large number of files within nested archives. This could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk space) and potentially crash the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper limits on archive recursion depth.
- Lack of proper limits on the number of files extracted from nested archives.
- Potential denial-of-service by consuming excessive resources when processing malicious archives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Service disruption due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk space).
- Potential crash of the service handling archive extraction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Uploading or providing a specially crafted archive file with excessive recursion.
- Uploading or providing a specially crafted archive file containing an extremely large number of files in nested archives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to upload or provide files to the system that performs archive extraction.

**Technical Details of the Fix:**
The commit addresses the vulnerability by introducing limits on:
- **`max_recurse`:** Maximum recursion depth for nested archives.
- **`max_files_in_recursive_archive`**: Maximum number of files allowed in recursive archives.
- The code now checks, at each level of recursion, if these limits are exceeded and stops the extraction to prevent resource exhaustion.
- The system reports a warning when these limits are exceeded with the possibility to rescan the file if the user desires.

**Code Changes:**
- **`extractor.py`**:
    - Implements a check on archive recursion depth using the `max_recurse` and `max_files_in_recursive_archive` parameters, preventing infinite loops or a very large number of extractions.
    - When the limits are reached, the extraction process stops and the user is alerted.
- **`extractor.yml.sample`**:
    - Introduces the new configuration parameters:
        - `max_files_in_recursive_archive`: sets the maximum number of files within recursive archives
        - `max_recurse`: sets the maximum recursion level allowed for archive extraction

The commit also addresses a minor issue where a warning was shown only if the status of the processed files was not `NOTAPPLICABLE`. Now the code always shows a warning if the archive appears to be empty.

This commit aims to make the system more resilient to malicious archive attacks.
