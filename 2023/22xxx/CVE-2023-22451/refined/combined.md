# Weak password requirements in Kiwi TCMS

Moderate

[atodorov](/atodorov)
published
GHSA-496x-2jqf-hp7g
Jan 2, 2023

## Package

Kiwi TCMS

## Affected versions

<= 11.6

## Patched versions

11.7

## Description

### Impact

When users register new accounts and/or change passwords there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password.

### Patches

This issue is resolved by providing sane defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting:

* password can’t be too similar to your other personal information.
* password must contain at least 10 characters.
* password can’t be a commonly used password.
* password can’t be entirely numeric.

### Workarounds

An administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak one may have been chosen. For example execute the following code snippet in the Kiwi TCMS Python shell:

```
import uuid
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

for user in User.objects.all():
    user.set_password(uuid.uuid4().hex)
    user.save()

```

Note that this is resetting each user's password to a random one!
