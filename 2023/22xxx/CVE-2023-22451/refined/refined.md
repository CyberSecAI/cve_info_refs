Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of password validation during user registration and password changes in Kiwi TCMS. This allows users to create accounts with easily guessable passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient password complexity requirements.
- Absence of checks against common or weak passwords.
- No enforcement of minimum password length.
- No restrictions on passwords similar to user information.
- Specifically, the system does not enforce strong password policies by utilizing `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to user accounts due to easily guessable passwords.
- Potential compromise of the entire system if administrative accounts have weak passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Brute-force attacks against user accounts using common or predictable passwords.
- Dictionary attacks.
- Social engineering to guess passwords easily.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no special position and can be an external user interacting with the Kiwi TCMS web interface.
- The attacker requires knowledge of a valid user login/registration process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding proper password validation rules to the application
- Patched versions of the software enforce a minimum password length of 10 characters and other password complexity rules like preventing the usage of common passwords.
- The commit `3759fb68aed36315cdde9fc573b2fe7c11544985` updates the tests to use a stronger password. However, this commit alone does not solve the security vulnerability. It is the addition of password validation rules that addresses the problem.
- The Github Security Advisory `GHSA-496x-2jqf-hp7g` is associated with CVE-2023-22451, confirming that the weak password requirements are the root cause of the CVE.
