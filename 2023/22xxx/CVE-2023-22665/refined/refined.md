The provided content includes information about CVE-2023-32200, not CVE-2023-22665. However, it incorrectly references CVE-2023-22665, so the information provided here is for CVE-2023-32200.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient restrictions on called script functions within Apache Jena.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper restrictions on the JavaScript functions that can be called from within SPARQL queries.
- This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to significant security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote user can execute arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting a malicious SPARQL query. This could lead to:
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the server running Apache Jena.
- Data exfiltration by accessing system resources.
- Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the server or consuming excessive resources.
- Other malicious activities, limited by the capabilities of the server environment.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted SPARQL query that contains malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit SPARQL queries to an Apache Jena instance.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned beyond the ability to send SPARQL queries, which suggests the vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.
