    "root_cause": "Standard users were able to manipulate Kubernetes secrets in the `local` cluster. This involved deleting the secret while preserving read-level permissions. This, followed by other crafted commands, led to gaining access to service account tokens.",

      "Insufficient access control leading to privilege escalation.",
       "Ability for users to manipulate secrets in the `local` cluster.",
       "Preservation of read permissions after secret deletion.",
