An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher allowed standard users to leverage their existing permissions to manipulate Kubernetes secrets in the local
 cluster, resulting in the secret being deleted, but their read-level 
permissions to the secret being preserved. When this operation was 
followed-up by other specially crafted commands, it could result in the 
user gaining access to tokens belonging to service accounts in the local cluster.


This issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.0 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4.
