- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the data that can be contained in a topic draft within the Discourse platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded data storage in topic drafts leading to potential resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by creating excessively large drafts, slowing down the instance.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a low level of privileges and some user interaction (creating the draft).
