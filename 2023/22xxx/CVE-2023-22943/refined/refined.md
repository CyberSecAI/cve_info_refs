- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a connection over HTTPS fails, the REST API Modular Input incorrectly falls back to using HTTP to connect to third-party APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure fallback to HTTP after HTTPS connection failure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Potential exposure of data transmitted between the Splunk instance and third-party APIs due to lack of encryption.
    - Possible tampering with the data in transit.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks by intercepting the communication between the Splunk instance and the third-party APIs when it reverts to HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the communication channel between the Splunk instance and the third-party API.
    - Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
