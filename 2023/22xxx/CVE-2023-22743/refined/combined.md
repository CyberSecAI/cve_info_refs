# Git for Windows' uninstaller vulnerable to DLL hijacking when run under the SYSTEM user account

Low

[vdye](/vdye)
published
GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3
Apr 12, 2022

## Package

git-for-windows
(-)

## Affected versions

<=2.35.1.2

## Patched versions

v2.35.2

## Description

### Impact

Since part of Git for Windows' uninstaller is copied into the current user's temporary directory and run in that place, it is important to ensure that there are no malicious `.dll` file in that directory that might be loaded as part of loading the executable.

However, the default system settings for `TMP` and `TEMP` are to point to `C:\Windows\Temp`, a folder that is world-writable (for historical reasons), and the SYSTEM user account inherits those settings. This means that any authenticated user can place malicious `.dll` files that are loaded when Git for Windows' uninstaller is run via the SYSTEM account.

### Patches

Fixes are available in Git for Windows v2.35.2 or newer.

### Workarounds

* Override SYSTEM's `TMP` environment variable to point to a directory exclusively under SYSTEM's control before running the uninstaller
* Sweeping `C:\Windows\Temp` of all `.dll` files before running the uninstaller
* Running the uninstaller under an admin account rather than SYSTEM

### Credits

Thank you Lockheed Martin Red Team for finding and reporting this vulnerability!

# Git for Windows' installer is susceptible to DLL side loading attacks

High

[derrickstolee](/derrickstolee)
published
GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

git

## Affected versions

<=2.39.1

## Patched versions

2.39.2

## Description

### Impact

By carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked to DLL [side-load said DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/).

This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation.

### Patches

* [jrsoftware/issrc@869084f...d9c6feb](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc/compare/869084f1b421cd46be0380d3df21abc87fda0df3...d9c6feba2acc77d3ce3ed35141fc494f48e617f3)

### Workarounds

Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer. Or move the installer into a different directory before executing it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Using Manifests or Directives to Ensure That Visual Styles Can Be Applied to Applications

To enable your application to use visual styles, you must use ComCtl32.dll version 6 or later. Because version 6 is not redistributable, it is available only when your application is running on a version of Windows that contains it. Windows ships with both version 5 and version 6. ComCtl32.dll version 6 contains both the user controls and the common controls. By default, applications use the user controls defined in User32.dll and the common controls defined in ComCtl32.dll version 5. For a list of DLL versions and their distribution platforms, see [Common Control Versions](common-control-versions).

If you want your application to use visual styles, you must add an application manifest or compiler directive that indicates that ComCtl32.dll version 6 should be used if it is available.

An application manifest enables an application to specify which versions of an assembly it requires. In Microsoft Win32, an assembly is a set of DLLs and a list of versionable objects that are contained within those DLLs.

Manifests are written in XML. The name of the application manifest file is the name of your executable followed by the file name extension .manifest; for example, MyApp.exe.manifest. The following sample manifest shows that the first section describes the manifest itself. The following table shows the attributes set by the **assemblyIdentity** element in the manifest description section.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| version | Version of the manifest. The version must be in the form major.minor.revision.build (that is, n.n.n.n, where n <=65535). |
| processorArchitecture | Processor for which your application is developed. |
| name | Includes company name, product name and application name. |
| type | Type of your application, such as Win32. |

The sample manifest also provides a description of your application and specifies application dependencies. The following table shows the attributes set by the **assemblyIdentity** element in the dependency section.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| type | Type of the dependency component, such as Win32. |
| name | Name of the component. |
| version | Version of the component. |
| processorArchitecture | Processor that the component is designed for. |
| publicKeyToken | Key token used with this component. |
| language | Language of the component. |

Following is an example of a manifest file.

Important

Set the **processorArchitecture** entry to **"X86"** if your application targets the 32 bit Windows platform, or to **"amd64"** if your application targets the 64 bit Windows platform. You can also specify **"\*"**, which ensures that all platforms are targeted, as shown in the following examples.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
<assemblyIdentity
    version="1.0.0.0"
    processorArchitecture="*"
    name="CompanyName.ProductName.YourApplication"
    type="win32"
/>
<description>Your application description here.</description>
<dependency>
    <dependentAssembly>
        <assemblyIdentity
            type="win32"
            name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
            version="6.0.0.0"
            processorArchitecture="*"
            publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df"
            language="*"
        />
    </dependentAssembly>
</dependency>
</assembly>

```

If you are using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 or later, you can add the following compiler directive to your source code instead of manually creating a manifest. For readability, the directive is broken into several lines here.

```
#pragma comment(linker,"\"/manifestdependency:type='win32' \
name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' \
processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")

```

The following topics describe the steps for applying visual styles to different types of applications. Notice that the manifest format is the same in each case.

## Using ComCtl32.dll Version 6 in an Application That Uses Only Standard Extensions

The following are examples of applications that do not use third-party extensions.

* Calculator
* FreeCell (in Windows Vista and Windows 7)
* Minesweeper (in Windows Vista and Windows 7)
* Notepad
* Solitaire (in Windows Vista and Windows 7)

**To create a manifest and enable your application to use visual styles.**

1. Link to ComCtl32.lib and call [**InitCommonControls**](/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Commctrl/nf-commctrl-initcommoncontrols).
2. Add a file called YourApp.exe.manifest to your source tree that has the XML manifest format.

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
   <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
   <assemblyIdentity
       version="1.0.0.0"
       processorArchitecture="*"
       name="CompanyName.ProductName.YourApplication"
       type="win32"
   />
   <description>Your application description here.</description>
   <dependency>
       <dependentAssembly>
           <assemblyIdentity
               type="win32"
               name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
               version="6.0.0.0"
               processorArchitecture="*"
               publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df"
               language="*"
           />
       </dependentAssembly>
   </dependency>
   </assembly>

   ```
3. Add the manifest to your application's resource file as follows:

   ```
   CREATEPROCESS_MANIFEST_RESOURCE_ID RT_MANIFEST "YourApp.exe.manifest"

   ```

   Note

   When you add the previous entry to the resource you must format it on one line. Alternatively, you can place the XML manifest file in the same directory as your application's executable file. The operating system will load the manifest from the file system first, then check the resource section of the executable. The file system version takes precedence.

When you build your application, the manifest will be added as a binary resource.

## Using ComCtl32 Version 6 in Control Panel or a DLL That Is Run by RunDll32.exe

**To create a manifest and enable your application to use visual styles.**

1. Link to ComCtl32.lib and call [**InitCommonControls**](/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Commctrl/nf-commctrl-initcommoncontrols).
2. Add a file called YourApp.cpl.manifest to your source tree that has the XML manifest format.

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
   <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
   <assemblyIdentity
       version="1.0.0.0"
       processorArchitecture="*"
       name="CompanyName.ProductName.YourApplication"
       type="win32"
   />
   <description>Your application description here.</description>
   <dependency>
       <dependentAssembly>
           <assemblyIdentity
               type="win32"
               name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
               version="6.0.0.0"
               processorArchitecture="*"
               publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df"
               language="*"
           />
       </dependentAssembly>
   </dependency>
   </assembly>

   ```
3. Add the manifest to your application's resource file as resource ID 123.

Note

When you author a Control Panel application, place it in the appropriate category. Control Panel now supports categorization of Control Panel applications. This means that Control Panel applications can be assigned identifiers and separated into task areas such as Add or Remove Programs, Appearance and Themes, or Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options.

## Adding Visual Style Support to an Extension, Plug-in, MMC Snap-in or a DLL That Is Brought into a Process

Support for visual styles can be added to an extension, plug-in, MMC snap-in, or a DLL that is brought into a process. For example, use the following steps to add visual styles support for an Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in.

1. Compile your snap-in with the -DISOLATION\_AWARE\_ENABLED flag or insert the following statement before the #include "windows.h" statement.

   ```
   #define ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED 1

   ```

   For more information about ISOLATION\_AWARE\_ENABLED, see [Isolating Components](/en-us/windows/desktop/SbsCs/isolating-components).
2. Include the common control header file in your snap-in source.

   ```
   #include <commctrl.h>

   ```
3. Add a file called YourApp.manifest to your source tree that uses the XML manifest format.

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
   <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
   <assemblyIdentity
       version="1.0.0.0"
       processorArchitecture="*"
       name="CompanyName.ProductName.YourApplication"
       type="win32"
   />
   <description>Your application description here.</description>
   <dependency>
       <dependentAssembly>
           <assemblyIdentity
               type="win32"
               name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
               version="6.0.0.0"
               processorArchitecture="*"
               publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df"
               language="*"
           />
       </dependentAssembly>
   </dependency>
   </assembly>

   ```
4. Add the manifest to your snap-in's resource file. See [Using ComCtl32 Version 6 in an Application That Uses Extensions, Plug-ins, or a DLL That Is Brought into a Process](/en-us/previous-versions//ms649781%28v%3Dvs.85%29) for details on adding a manifest to a resource file.

## Turning Off Visual Styles

You can turn off visual styles for a control or for all controls in a window by calling the [**SetWindowTheme**](/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Uxtheme/nf-uxtheme-setwindowtheme) function as follows:

```
SetWindowTheme(hwnd, L" ", L" ");

```

In the previous example, *hwnd* is the handle of the window in which to disable visual styles. After the call, the control renders without visual styles.

## Using Visual Styles with HTML Content

HTML pages that modify the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties such as background or border do not have visual styles applied to them. They display the specified CSS attribute. When specified as part of the content, most CSS properties do apply to elements that have visual styles applied.

By default, visual styles are applied to intrinsic HTML controls on pages displayed in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later versions. To turn off visual styles for an HTML page, add a META tag to the `<head>` section. This technique also applies to content packaged as HTML Applications (HTAs). To turn off visual styles, the META tag must be as follows:

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="MSThemeCompatible" CONTENT="no">

```

Note

If the browser setting and the tag setting do not agree, the page will not apply visual styles. For example, if the META tag is set to "no" and the browser is set to enable visual styles, visual styles will not be applied to the page. However, if either the browser or META tag is set to "yes" and the other item is not specified, visual styles will be applied.

Visual styles might change the layout of your content. Also, if you set certain attributes on intrinsic HTML controls, such as the width of a button, you might find that the label on the button is unreadable under certain visual styles.

You must thoroughly test your content using visual styles to determine whether applying visual styles has an adverse effect on your content and layout.

## When Visual Styles are not Applied

To avoid applying visual styles to a top level window, give the window a non-null region (**SetWindowRgn**). The system assumes that a window with a non-NULL region is a specialized window that does not use visual styles. A child window associated with a non-visual-styles top level window may still apply visual styles even though the parent window does not.

If you want to disable the use of visual styles for all windows in your application, call [**SetThemeAppProperties**](/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Uxtheme/nf-uxtheme-setthemeappproperties) and do not pass the STAP\_ALLOW\_NONCLIENT flag. If an application does not call **SetThemeAppProperties**, the assumed flag values are STAP\_ALLOW\_NONCLIENT | STAP\_ALLOW\_CONTROLS | STAP\_ALLOW\_WEBCONTENT. The assumed values cause the nonclient area, the controls, and web content to have a visual style applied.

## Making Your Application Compatible with Earlier Versions of Windows

Much of the visual style architecture is designed to make it simple to continue to ship your product on earlier versions of Windows that do not support changing the appearance of controls. When shipping an application for more than one operating system, be aware of the following:

* In versions of Windows prior to Windows 8, visual styles are off when high contrast is on. To support high contrast, a legacy application that supports visual styles needs to provide a separate code path to properly draw UI elements in high contrast. In Windows 8, high contrast is a part of visual styles; however, a Windows 8 application (one that includes the Windows 8 GUID in compatibility section of its application manifest) still needs to provide a separate code path to render correctly in high contrast on Windows 7 an earlier.
* If you use the features in ComCtl32.dll version 6, such as the tile view or link control, you must handle the case where those controls are not available on your user's computer. ComCtl32.dll version 6 is not redistributable.
* Test your application to make sure you are not relying on features of ComCtl32.dll version 6 without first checking for the current version.
* Do not link to UxTheme.lib.
* Write error-handling code for instances when visual styles do not work as expected.
* Installing your application's manifest in earlier versions will not affect the rendering of controls.

# gitk can inadvertently call executables in the worktree

High

[derrickstolee](/derrickstolee)
published
GHSA-wxwv-49qw-35pm
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

git-for-windows

## Affected versions

<=2.39.1

## Patched versions

2.39.2

## Description

### Impact

When `gitk` is run on Windows, it potentially runs executables from the current directory inadvertently, which can be exploited with some social engineering to trick users into running untrusted code.

### Patches

* [3650ca5](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/3650ca5592a94f3d9ce24ad118c65f087bc95f2c)

### Workarounds

Avoid using `gitk` (or Git GUI's "Visualize History" functionality) in clones of untrusted repositories.

### References

# "git apply" overwriting paths outside the working tree

High

[ttaylorr](/ttaylorr)
published
GHSA-r87m-v37r-cwfh
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v2.39.1, v2.38.3, v2.37.5, v2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, v2.30.7

## Patched versions

>= v2.39.2, v2.38.4, v2.37.6, v2.36.5, v2.35.7, v2.34.7, v2.33.7, v2.32.6, v2.31.7, v2.30.8

## Description

### Impact

By feeding specially crafted input to `git apply`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten as the user who is running `git apply`.

### Patches

A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8.

### Workarounds

Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying; avoid applying one that creates a symbolic link and then creates a file beyond the symbolic link.

### Credits

Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Joern Schneeweisz of GitLab. The patch was authored by Patrick Steinhardt of GitLab.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-23946

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.[[1]](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-dll-sideloading.pdf)

# Local clone-based data exfiltration with non-local transports

Moderate

[ttaylorr](/ttaylorr)
published
GHSA-gw92-x3fm-3g3q
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v2.39.1, v2.38.3, v2.37.5, v2.36.4, v2.35.6, v2.34.6, v2.33.6, v2.32.5, v2.31.6, v2.30.7

## Patched versions

>= v2.39.2, v2.38.4, v2.37.6, v2.36.5, v2.35.7, v2.34.7, v2.33.7, v2.32.6, v2.31.7, v2.30.8

## Description

### Impact

Using a specially-crafted repository, Git can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links (c.f., [CVE-2022-39253](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85)), the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link.

These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as [CVE-2022-39253](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85).

### Patches

A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8.

### Workarounds

The most complete workaround is upgrading to the most recent patched version published.

If doing so is impractical, then there are a couple of short-term workarounds.

* Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`.
* Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs.

# About Side-by-Side Assemblies

## In this article

A Windows side-by-side assembly is described by <manifests>. A side-by-side assembly contains a collection of resourcesâa group of DLLs, Windows classes, COM servers, type libraries, or interfacesâthat are always provided to applications together. These are described in the assembly manifest.

Typically, a side-by-side assembly is a single DLL. For example, the Microsoft COMCTL32 assembly is a single DLL with a manifest whereas the Microsoft Visual C++ development system run-time libraries assembly contains multiple files. Manifests contain [*metadata*](m-sbscs-gly) that describes side-by-side assemblies and side-by-side assembly dependencies.

Side-by-side assemblies are used by the operating system as fundamental units of naming, binding, versioning, deployment, and configuration. Every side-by-side assembly has a unique identity. One of the attributes of the assembly identity is its version. For more information, see [Assembly Versions](assembly-versions).

Starting with Windows XP, multiple versions of side-by-side assemblies can be used by applications running at the same time. Manifests, and the assembly version number, are used by the loader to determine the correct binding of assembly versions to applications. Side-by-side assemblies and manifests work with applications and the side-by-side manager as illustrated in the following figure.

![representation of typical side-by-side assembly](images/sxsman.png)

In the preceding example, both Comctl32.DLL version 6.0 and Comctl32.DLL version 5.0 are in the side-by-side assembly cache and available to applications. When an application calls to load the DLL, the side-by-side manager determines whether the application has a version dependence described in a manifest. If there is no relevant manifest, the system loads the default version of the assembly. For Windows XP, version 5.0 of Comctl32.DLL is the system default. If the side-by-side manager finds a dependence on version 6.0 stated in a manifest, that version is loaded to run with the application.

Several key system assemblies are being made available from Microsoft as side-by-side assemblies. For more information, see [Supported Microsoft Side-by-side Assemblies](supported-microsoft-side-by-side-assemblies). Application developers can also create their own side-by-side assemblies. For more information, see [Guidelines for Creating Side-by-side Assemblies](guidelines-for-creating-side-by-side-assemblies). In many cases it is possible to update existing applications to use side-by-side assemblies without having to change the application code.

Developers are encouraged to use side-by-side assemblies to create [isolated applications](isolated-applications), and to update existing applications into isolated applications for the following reasons:

* Side-by-side assemblies reduce the possibility of DLL version conflicts.
* Side-by-side assembly sharing enables multiple versions of COM or Windows assemblies to run at the same time.
* Applications and administrators can update assembly configuration on either a [global](publisher-configuration) or [per-application configuration](per-application-configuration) basis after deployment. For example, an application can be updated to use a side-by-side assembly that includes an update without having to reinstall the application.
