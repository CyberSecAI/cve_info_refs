Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `GridFieldPrintButton` in the Silverstripe framework incorrectly validates the permissions of `DataObjects` when generating the print view. Specifically, it fails to properly check the `canView` permission, leading to potential unauthorized data access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of a proper authorization check before rendering `DataObjects` in the print view. The code was not enforcing the `canView` method on the data objects before including them in the printed output.
- **CWE-284**:  Improper Access Control, was initially identified as the weakness. Later, it was changed to CWE-862

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** A content author could potentially view records that they are not authorized to access, thereby bypassing the intended access control mechanisms.
- **Confidentiality Loss:** The vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- **GridField Print View:** An attacker would need to use the print view functionality of the GridField in the Silverstripe framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges (e.g., content author role) to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The exploitation does not require any user interaction beyond accessing the vulnerable print functionality.
- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to a Silverstripe application using a vulnerable version of the framework.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `silverstripe/framework` versions prior to 4.12.5.
- The fix involves adding a check for the `canView` method on the data objects before including them in the print output.
- The vulnerability was reported by Stephan Bauer from relaxt Webdienstleistungsagentur GmbH.
- The fix was implemented in commit `fd5d821` which includes a fix in `src/Forms/GridField/GridFieldPrintButton.php` and corresponding tests.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3, with a base score of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
- The EPSS score is 0.070% (33rd percentile).
