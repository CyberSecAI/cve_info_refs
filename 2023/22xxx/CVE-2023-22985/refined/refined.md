- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to validate or encode user-supplied input before including it in the output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to XSS through the Name, Referrer, Location, and Comments fields.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.
    - This could lead to sensitive information disclosure such as cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.
    - Account compromise may occur if session cookies are obtained, allowing account hijacking.
    - Attackers could rewrite content of the HTML page.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts within the vulnerable fields of the application (Name, Referrer, Location and Comments) to be executed in another user's browser session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to input data into the application. The attack is classified as 'local'.
