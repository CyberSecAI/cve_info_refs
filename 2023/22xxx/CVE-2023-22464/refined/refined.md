      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when rendering the 'copyfrom path' in revision view. Specifically, the 'copyfrom path' of a changed file is not HTML-escaped.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper output escaping.",
         "CWE-80"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with commit access to a Subversion repository can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code, which gets executed in the browser of a user viewing the revision changes if they are convinced to visit a specific page.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker with commit privileges can create a file with a malicious name (containing HTML/JavaScript code) in a Subversion repository. Then, they can copy or rename the file within the repository. Finally, they must convince a user to view the revision details containing the copy operation.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs commit access to the Subversion repository exposed by a ViewVC instance. Additionally, the attacker needs to convince a user to visit a specific URL that renders the injected malicious content."
    },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the 'copyfrom path' displayed when reviewing a revision. The initial report also identified a similar issue with the filename itself, which is tracked under CVE-2023-22456. The fix for CVE-2023-22464 involves HTML-escaping the `changes.copy_path` variable in the `revision.ezt` template file.  A workaround is provided which involves manually HTML escaping the changed path \"copyfrom paths\" in the template file by using `[format \"html\"][changes.copy_path][end]`."
