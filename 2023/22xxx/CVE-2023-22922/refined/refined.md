- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Zyxel NBG-418N v2 home router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted packets over Telnet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted packets to the device with Telnet enabled, but does not need to be authenticated.
