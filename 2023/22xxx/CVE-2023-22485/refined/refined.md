- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read in the `validate_protocol` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-127).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows reading out-of-bounds memory. The advisory states that the out-of-bounds read accesses `malloc` metadata and does not cause any visible damage.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted markdown document can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted markdown document to the `cmark-gfm` parser. The proof of concept shows how to do this through the command line.
