Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from Git's local clone optimization, which can be tricked into being used even when a non-local transport is specified. Although Git prevents local clones when the source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory itself could still be a symbolic link. This allows an attacker to bypass the symlink check and include arbitrary files from the victim's filesystem by crafting a malicious repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of symlink check:** The vulnerability exists due to the insufficient checks on symbolic links within the source repository, specifically the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory itself, during local clone optimization. Git only checks for symlinks within the directory but not if the directory itself is a symlink
- **Incorrect transport handling:** Git can be tricked into using local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. This is the core weakness, and is fixed in the patch by delaying the picking of the transport until after `get_repo_path()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** A malicious actor can craft a Git repository with a symlinked `objects` directory to point to sensitive files on a victim's machine. When the victim clones this repository (potentially through submodules) Git will copy the content from the symlinked directory into the working directory, leading to the exfiltration of data.
- The data exfiltration is achieved by a malicious repo using a symlink to access and copy arbitrary files from the victim's file system into the malicious repo's working copy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Repository:** An attacker hosts a malicious Git repository.
- **Submodules:**  A malicious repository can be embedded as a submodule in another repository, and if a victim clones with `--recurse-submodules` this vulnerability can be triggered.
- **Non-local transport with local clone optimization** The victim clones a malicious repo, potentially via a non-local transport such as http(s) but the git client incorrectly applies the local optimization during the clone, if the malicious repo is specially crafted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Repository Hosting:** The attacker needs to be able to host a Git repository, or compromise one.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to clone the malicious repository, potentially by tricking them into cloning the attacker's repo or a repo with a malicious submodule.
- **Knowledge of Victim's filesystem:**  To exfiltrate specific data, the attacker needs some knowledge of the victim's filesystem paths.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-39253, which was a local clone symlink dereference vulnerability, but this CVE can be triggered with non-local transport if the malicious repo is specially crafted.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves preventing Git from using the local clone optimization when it is not intended and preventing directory symlinks from being followed if the `FOLLOW_SYMLINKS` flag is not explicitly passed to `dir_iterator_begin`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- Patched versions of Git address this vulnerability by ensuring the correct transport is picked.
