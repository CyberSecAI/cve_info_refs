- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of XML external entity reference (XXE)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to improper input validation of XML data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a specially crafted project file that, when opened by a user, could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the file system where CX-Motion Pro is installed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the user to open a malicious project file provided by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious project file and have it opened by a user of the vulnerable software. The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the target system itself to carry out this attack. The user must willingly open the file for the exploit to work.
