Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is an OS command injection vulnerability in the `check_system_user` function within the `ys_thirdparty` component of the Milesight UR32L router. This function constructs a command string using user-supplied input without proper sanitization and executes it via `popen`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the `check_system_user` function. Specifically, the `user` argument to the `user_permission` command is incorporated into a shell command, enabling the injection of arbitrary commands via backticks.
*   **Use of `popen`:** The `popen` function is used to execute the generated command string which allows for command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the router with elevated privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands can lead to a complete compromise of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network request to the router. Specifically, the `user` command in the `user_permission` menu via Telnet/SSH is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative credentials to access the router's console (telnet or SSH) and use the `enable`, `configure terminal`, and `user_permission` commands.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the router.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `check_system_user` function, which constructs the shell command `/usr/sbin/userpermit.sh chk 0 <username>` and executes it with `popen`.
*   The `user` command, when issued with `user <malicious_username> name <new_username>`, triggers the vulnerability as the malicious username gets embedded in the shell command without sanitization.
*   The exploit can be triggered through the routerâ€™s CLI, specifically through the `user` command within the `user_permission` context after gaining admin access through telnet or SSH.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**

The provided proof of concept demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting the `reboot` command. When `user \`reboot\` name test` command is executed, the system reboots, confirming arbitrary command execution.
