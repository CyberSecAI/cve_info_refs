# Netdata Streaming Alert Command Injection

High

[ralphm](/ralphm)
published
GHSA-xg38-3vmw-2978
Dec 1, 2022

## Package

netdata

## Affected versions

Stable < 1.37, Nightlies < 1.36.0-409

## Patched versions

1.36.0-409, 1.37

## Description

### Impact

An attacker with the ability to establish a streaming connection can execute arbitrary commands on the targeted Netdata agent.

When an alert is triggered, the function `health_alarm_execute` is called. This function performs different checks and then enqueues a command by calling `spawn_enq_cmd`. This command is populated with several arguments that are not sanitized. One of them is the `registry_hostname` of the node for which the alert is raised. By providing a specially crafted `registry_hostname` as part of the health data that is streamed to a Netdata (parent) agent, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands at the remote host as a side-effect of the raised alert.

Note that the commands are executed as the user running the Netdata Agent. This user is usually named `netdata`. The ability to run arbitrary commands may allow an attacker to escalate privileges by escalating other vulnerabilities in the system, as that user.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in:

```
Netdata agent v1.37 (stable)
Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly)

```
### Workarounds

Streaming is not enabled by default. If you have previously enabled this, it can be disabled by modifying `stream.conf`:

```
[stream]
    enabled = no

```

Limiting access to the port on the recipient Agent to trusted child connections may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
