- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Robotic Process Automation session tokens are not invalidated after a password reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session tokens remain valid after a user's password has been reset, which allows for potential unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially maintain access to a user's account even after the user has changed their password by using the old session token.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with a valid session token could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid session token of a user whose password has been reset.
