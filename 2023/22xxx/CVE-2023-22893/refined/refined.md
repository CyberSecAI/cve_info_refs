{
  "CVE-2023-22893": {
    "description": "Authentication Bypass for AWS Cognito Login Provider in Strapi Versions <=4.5.6",
    "root_cause": "The Strapi server did not verify the JWT token provided by the AWS Cognito login provider. It only decodes the JWT and extracts the username and email without any verification against the public key of the user pool.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Missing OAuth token verification"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can forge a JWT token to impersonate any user who uses AWS Cognito to authenticate, gaining unauthorized access to the Strapi API. This does not affect the admin panel.",
    "attack_vector": "A crafted JWT token is sent to the `/api/auth/cognito/callback` endpoint.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to forge a JWT token and know the email address of the victim."
  },
  "CVE-2023-22621": {
      "description": "SSTI to RCE by Exploiting Email Templates in Strapi Versions <=4.5.5",
      "root_cause": "The `sendTemplatedEmail` function uses the `lodash` template engine to render email templates, which allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the templates. The validation function `isValidEmailTemplate` could be bypassed using a crafted payload.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)",
        "Inadequate input validation",
        "Use of template engine with code execution capabilities"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with admin access can inject a malicious payload into an email template that, when rendered, allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can be chained with CVE-2023-22894 to achieve unauthenticated RCE.",
       "attack_vector": "A crafted payload is injected into an email template via the admin panel, which is then triggered when the email is rendered.",
      "required_capabilities": "Initially, the attacker needs administrator access. When chained with CVE-2023-22894, this vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users."
   },
    "CVE-2023-22894": {
      "description": "Leaking Sensitive User Information by Filtering on Private Fields in Strapi Versions <=4.7.1",
      "root_cause": "The Strapi filtering functionality does not properly filter out private fields during queries. It removes private fields from the results but still uses them for filtering the queries. This allows attackers to infer values of private fields by using the `$startsWith` filter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Information disclosure",
        "Vulnerable filtering logic"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can leak sensitive user information, such as password hashes and reset tokens, by bruteforcing the values of private fields character by character. This can be done by unauthenticated users through relational fields or the `created_by`/`updated_by` fields",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious user crafts a series of API requests using the $startsWith filter on sensitive fields.",
       "required_capabilities":"An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending requests to any Strapi API endpoint that is accessible and contains a relation to user data. An attacker can exploit the `/content-manager/collection-types/plugin::users-permissions.user`, `/admin/users` routes or collections with a relationship to `users-permissions.user` or the admin users."
