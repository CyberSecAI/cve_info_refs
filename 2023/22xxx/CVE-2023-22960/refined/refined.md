- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper implementation of brute-force protection mechanisms for local accounts on Lexmark devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the bypass of the brute-force protection, which allows for unrestricted attempts to guess local account credentials. This is related to CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) and potentially CWE-799 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of local account credentials, potentially granting an attacker unauthorized access to the device and its functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L) and no privileges (PR:N), with no user interaction (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U), and the impact is limited to low confidentiality (C:L), with no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the network to send login attempts. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
