Lexmark Security Advisory:

1.0
Revision:
Last update:
17 January 2023
Public Release Date:  23 January 2023

Summary
This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass protections on the device that protect local accounts against
brute-force guessing attacks.

References
CVE:     CVE-2023-22960

CWE:     CWE-307,  CWE-799

Details
Lexmark devices have a feature that protects against local account credential brute-force guessing attacks by
temporarily locking out an account for an amount of time after a number of unsuccessful login attempts. The
number of attempts and the lockout time can be set by a device administrator.

This vulnerability bypasses the brute-force protection, allowing unrestricted attempts to guess a local account’s
credentials.
