Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-wvr4-gc4c-6vmx
Jan 9, 2023

## Package

Talk Android
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 15.0.2

## Patched versions

15.0.2

## Description

### Impact

To exploit this the attacker needs to have a physical access to the target's device.

Due to the bypass of passcode an attacker is able to access the user's Nextcloud files and view conversations.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk Android app is upgraded to 15.0.2

### Workarounds

No workaround available

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22473
