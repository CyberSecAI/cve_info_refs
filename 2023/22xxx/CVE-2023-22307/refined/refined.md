- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords for administrator and authentication were submitted as GET parameters in webconf when creating a site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information (passwords) was exposed in the URL, which was then logged in the Apache access logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the Apache access logs could potentially recover the administrator and authentication passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, as an attacker would need access to the server where Apache logs were stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires local access to the server and access to the Apache access logs.
