  "CVE-2023-22730": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation within the cart, specifically related to clearance sales. The cart validators failed to properly check the individuality of line items, allowing users to add multiple instances of the same item, bypassing quantity limits and clearance sale restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows users to bypass selling limits and clearance sale restrictions by adding multiple identical line items to their cart through the API. This could lead to unintended sales and potential exploitation of clearance offers.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the API by adding duplicate line items to the cart.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to interact with the API and add items to the cart. No specific privileges or access to the backend are mentioned, suggesting this could be done by any customer interacting with the system."
