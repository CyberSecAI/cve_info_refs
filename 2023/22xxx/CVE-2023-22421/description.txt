Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Kostac PLC Programming Software (Former name: Koyo PLC Programming Software) Version 1.6.9.0 and earlier. The insufficient buffer size for the PLC program instructions leads to out-of-bounds read. As a result, opening a specially crafted project file may lead to information disclosure and/or arbitrary code execution.
