| |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Jan 9, 2023](item?id=34316206)   | [parent](item?id=34314504) | [context](context?id=34316206) | [favorite](fave?id=34316206&auth=8bb98599c357cdb06233b76e105f67953c835367) | on: [Three lessons from Threema: Analysis of a secure m...](item?id=34314504)  The attacks in this paper are much less damaging than the attacks in the Nebuchadnezzar paper were against Matrix. But somehow, Threema comes out looking even worse: \* Threema's end-to-end inner protocol, the one used to exchange messages between actual humans, is based on a single X25519 key, used bidirectionally. It has no forward secrecy. Worse, to prevent otherwise-trivial replay attacks made possible by the simplistic structure of the protocol, both sides have to cache every nonce they've seen used to encrypt a message. This breaks down when users change devices, which, due to the structure of the protocol, is trivially detectable. \* The Threema E2E protocol includes enough metadata to ostensibly enforce message ordering, *but they don't authenticate it*, so attackers can (1) strip the metadata off and (2) hold back and/or reorder messages at their luxury. \* Threema has the hello-world of E2E protocols, but for reasons not made clear has chosen to build their own transport protocol for client-server transactions (ie, login), rather than using TLS or NoiseIK. The C2S handshake has the raw material to do an authenticated DH key exchange, ala 3DH (both sides have long-term and ephemeral secrets), but they freelanced it instead and come up with a proof-of-identity round trip that is trivially replayable, and which destroys the forward secrecy of the C2S protocol. \* One form of Threema backup uses encrypted ZIPs, which reveal the names of files, which files apparently (according to the paper) reveal the identity of counterparties you've been talking to. Also: the ZIP library the client uses didn't verify MACs, and while Threema fixed that, the maintainer of the ZIP library Threema chose hasn't responded, which is :grimace-emoji:. \* You can "lock" your Threema app, but it does so much background processing that attackers can extract your private key if they have access to the device (or, maybe, all its traffic?) --- to wit, Threema does automated backups, the backups are compressed-then-encrypted, Threema processes messages in the background even when locked, one of those messages runs an automatic contact discovery protocol, and attackers can inject contact-discovery messages to do a byte-by-byte CRIME-style recovery of the private key, which is embedded in the same JSON document(!) as contact information in the backup system. There is a very funny bit in the middle of the paper where they reconstitute the C2S proof-of-identity replay attack, this time minting a new identity proof rather than replaying it. To pull this off, they bounce the C2S protocol off of the E2E protocol: because, and I cannot believe I am saying this, Threema uses PKCS7 padding (ie, "I'm 3 bytes short of my block size, so I'll pad with 03h 03h 03h"), you can trick a Threema client into sending a message which, once encrypted, will have the 01h-delimited format of the identity proof (because 1/254 validly padded messages will happen to end in 01h). I didn't read closely enough to figure out if there was any reason you would go to the trouble of executing this attack variant, and it is entirely possible that they are just showing off. But: that's why you read these kinds of papers! For the stunt cryptography! A bit of advice: read these papers for the cryptographic design and pitfall ideas, not for verdicts on which messaging systems to use. Maybe there are very good reasons to use Threema besides its flimsy protocol design; the point is: we know how to design better protocols that don't have these problems, and so (1) here are some more examples for the textbooks on why you should domain-separate your keys (for instance, to make it impossible to bounce the C2S protocol off the E2E protocol in the first place), and (2) Threema could drastically improve their system simply by adopting a known-good protocol rather than freelancing their own. Great stuff.

Like looking at a house you're thinking of buying and seeing a giant hole in the wall and looking at a different house with a damp mildew smell in every room. The hole in the wall is a more immediate and obvious problem, but the smell suggests the more significant concern. Cryptographic systems in particular seem good at generating these kind of warning signs, since there is a significant overlap between "I can't immediately catastrophically break this" and "WTF are you doing?". Arguably, making these kinds of terrible cryptographic choices suggests something fundamentally broken in your design process that isn't fixed by just addressing specific weaknesses. This seems especially true in the secure messaging arena, where if you can't articulate an extremely good reason you can't use an existing protocol, the default position should be to avoid your product. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [sys42590](user?id=sys42590) [on Jan 10, 2023](item?id=34321629)   | [prev](#34318555) [–]  The story around Threema feels a tiny bit like Crypto AG repeating: Reputable Swiss company sells homebrew crypto to unsuspecting parties. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pvg](user?id=pvg) [on Jan 10, 2023](item?id=34321817)   | [parent](#34321629) [–]  Crypto AG was effectively owned and operated by intelligence services. There's no evidence at all this is the case for Threema, if anything, you'd expect intelligence services to hide their tracks far better. 'A functional, secure E2EE instant messenger with broad public appeal/usability' is just a very convoluted, readily bungle-able project. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sys42590](user?id=sys42590) [on Jan 10, 2023](item?id=34322067)   | [root](#34321629) | [parent](#34321817) [–]  Threema had 9 years to migrate to something more standard like the Signal protocol, given the findings in the article, that would have been a great idea. In their defense, they're a comparably tiny company, so a full protocol rewrite might be too much of cost to keep their investors happy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pvg](user?id=pvg) [on Jan 10, 2023](item?id=34322235)   | [root](#34321629) | [parent](#34322067) [–]  *migrate to something more standard like the Signal protocol* That helps less than it might seem at first glance because it's just a very convoluted, readily bungle-able project, as per: <https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/62598.html> with HN discussion here: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33929620> and one of its references, which I don't think has had HN coverage [https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentat...](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht) None of these difficulties imply or require infiltration by intelligence services. | | --- | --- | --- | | |

for rating Zip4j as the best Java library for zip files [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9324933/what-is-a-good-java-library-to-zip-unzip-files), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5362364/java-library-to-work-with-zip-files), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/166340/recommendations-on-a-free-library-to-be-used-for-zipping-files), [4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18201279/file-compression-library-for-java/18201553)]. It has encouraged me to
bring this project to life again after a gap of several years. I tried to add some of the important features that
were requested over this time, and also made the API much more neater. The newer version (> 2.0.0) now supports streams,
which was understandably, one of the most requested feature. If you have any feedback, bugs to report, feature
requests, etc, please open an issue here on GitHub. I will try to address them as soon as I can. I also monitor the
tag `zip4j` on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zip4j).

## About

Zip4j is the most comprehensive Java library for zip files or streams. As of this writing, it is the only Java library
which has support for zip encryption, apart from several other features. It tries to make handling zip files/streams
a lot more easier. No more clunky boiler plate code with input streams and output streams. As you can see in the usage
section below, working with zip files can now even be a single line of code, compared to [this](https://www.baeldung.com/java-compress-and-uncompress). I mean no offense
to the Java's built-in zip support. In fact, this library depends on Java's built-in zip code and it would have been
significantly more ~~complicated~~ challenging if I had to write compression logic as well. But lets be honest, working with zip
files or streams can be a lot of boiler plate code. The main goal of this library is to provide a simple API for all
usual actions of a zip file or streams by doing the heavy lifting within the library and not have developers worry about
having to deal with streams, etc. Apart from usability, another important goal of this library is to provide support for
as many zip features as possible, which brings me to:

## Features

* Create, Add, Extract, Update, Remove files from a zip file
* Support for streams (ZipInputStream and ZipOutputStream)
* Read/Write password protected zip files and streams
* Support for both AES and zip standard encryption methods
* Support for Zip64 format
* Store (No Compression) and Deflate compression method
* Create or extract files from split zip files (Ex: z01, z02,...zip)
* Support for Unicode file names and comments in zip
* Progress Monitor - for integration into apps and user facing applications

## Background

Zip4j was started by me (Srikanth Reddy Lingala) back in 2008/2009, when I realized the lack of support for majority of zip format
features in Java. And also working with zip files was, as mentioned several times above, a lot of boiler plate code,
having to deal with streams (worse still, it was back in the days when there was no try-with-resources in Java). There
was also no comprehensive library which supports zip features. So, I decided to write one, and approximately after a
year, the first version was out. The response was truly overwhelming, and I got a lot of support right from the next
day of release. It was not put on GitHub as git/GitHub was not as popular as it is now. Code was hosted on my website,
as, guess what, a zip file :). And unfortunately, after a year or two after the initial release, life got busy and I was
not able to support Zip4j as much as I wanted to. But the overwhelming encouragement I got over the years made me start working on Zip4j
once again, and makes me support Zip4j as much as I can.

## Requirements

JDK 7 or later\*

\* Zip4j is written on JDK 8, as some of the features (NIO) that Zip4j supports requires features available only in
JDK 8. However, considering the fact that Zip4j is widely used in Android, and to support older versions of Android,
Zip4j supports JDK 7 as well. In cases where the feature/class from JDK 8 is missing, Zip4j falls back to the features
available in JDK 7. In other words, when running on JDK 7, not all features will be supported.

## Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lingala.zip4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>zip4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Please check the latest version number on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j).

## Usage

### Creating a zip file with single file in it / Adding single file to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile("filename.ext");
```

Or

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile(new File("filename.ext"));
```

### Creating a zip file with multiple files / Adding multiple files to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFiles(Arrays.asList(new File("first_file"), new File("second_file")));
```

### Creating a zip file by adding a folder to it / Adding a folder to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFolder(new File("/users/some_user/folder_to_add"));
```

Since v2.6, it is possible to exclude certain files when adding a folder to zip by using an ExcludeFileFilter

```
ExcludeFileFilter excludeFileFilter = filesToExclude::contains;
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setExcludeFileFilter(excludeFileFilter);
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFolder(new File("/users/some_user/folder_to_add"), zipParameters);
```

### Creating a zip file from stream / Adding a stream to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addStream(inputStream, new ZipParameters());
```

Passing in `new ZipParameters()`, as in the above example, will make Zip4j use default zip parameters. Please look at
[ZipParameters](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j/latest/net/lingala/zip4j/model/ZipParameters.html#ZipParameters--) to see the default configuration.

### Creating a zip file of compression method STORE / Adding entries to zip file of compression method STORE

By default Zip4j uses Deflate compression algorithm to compress files. However, if you would like to not use any
compression (called STORE compression), you can do so as shown in the example below:

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.STORE);

new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile("fileToAdd", zipParameters);
```

You can similarly pass in zip parameters to all the other examples to create a zip file of STORE compression.

### Creating a password protected zip file / Adding files to an existing zip with password protection

##### AES encryption

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setEncryptFiles(true);
zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);
// Below line is optional. AES 256 is used by default. You can override it to use AES 128. AES 192 is supported only for extracting.
zipParameters.setAesKeyStrength(AesKeyStrength.KEY_STRENGTH_256);

List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.addFiles(filesToAdd, zipParameters);
```

##### Zip standard encryption

Instead of AES, replace `zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);` with
`zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.ZIP_STANDARD);`. You can omit the line to set AES key strength. As
the name suggests, this is only applicable for AES encryption.

In all the above examples, you can similarly pass in zip parameters with appropriate password configuration to create
a password protected zip file.

### Creating a split zip file

If you want to split the zip file over several files when the size exceeds a particular limit, you can do so like this:

```
List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip");
zipFile.createSplitZipFile(filesToAdd, new ZipParameters(), true, 10485760); // using 10MB in this example
```

Passing in `new ZipParameters()`, as in the above example, will make Zip4j use default zip parameters. Please look at
[ZipParameters](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j/latest/net/lingala/zip4j/model/ZipParameters.html#ZipParameters--) to see the default configuration.

Zip file format specifies a minimum of 65536 bytes (64KB) as a minimum length for split files. Zip4j will throw an
exception if anything less than this value is specified.

To create a split zip with password protection, pass in appropriate ZipParameters as shown in the example below:

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setEncryptFiles(true);
zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);

List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.createSplitZipFile(filesToAdd, zipParameters, true, 10485760); // using 10MB in this example
```

### Zip64 format

Zip64 is a zip feature which allows support for zip files when the size of the zip file exceeds the maximum that can be
stored in 4 bytes (i.e., greater than 4,294,967,295 bytes). Traditionally, zip headers have a provision of 4 bytes to store
for file sizes. But with growing file sizes compared to a few decades back, zip file format extended support of file
sizes which extends 4 bytes by adding additional headers which uses 8 bytes for file sizes (compressed and
uncompressed file sizes). This feature is known as Zip64.

Zip4j will automatically make a zip file with Zip64 format and add appropriate headers, when it detects the zip file to be
crossing this file size limit. You do not have to explicitly specify any flag for Zip4j to use this feature.

### Extracting all files from a zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractAll("/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting all files from a password protected zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractAll("/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a single file from zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a folder from zip (since v2.6.0)

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractFile("folderNameInZip/", "/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a single file from zip which is password protected

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory");
```

Since v2.6.0: If the file name represents a directory, Zip4j will extract all files in the zip that are part of this directory.

### Extracting a single file from zip and giving it a new file name

Below example will extract the file `fileNameInZip.txt` from the zip file to the output directory `/destination_directory`
and will give the file the name `newfileName.txt`. Without the third parameter of the new file name, the same name as the
file in the zip will be used, which in this case is `fileNameInZip.txt`. If the file being extracted is a directory,
`newFileName` parameter will be used as the directory name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory", "newfileName.txt");
```

### Get an input stream for an entry in a zip file

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("entry_name_in_zip.txt");
InputStream inputStream = zipFile.getInputStream(fileHeader);
```

You can now use this input stream to read content from it/write content to an output stream. Please note that the
entry/file name is relative to the directory it is in. If `entry_name_in_zip.txt` is in a folder called "root\_folder" in
the zip, then you have to use `zipFile.getFileHeader("root_folder/entry_name_in_zip.txt");`.

### Remove a file/entry from a zip file

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").removeFile("fileNameInZipToRemove");
```

If `fileNameInZipToRemove` represents a folder all the files and folders under this folder will be removed as well
(this is valid since v2.5.0 of Zip4j. All prior versions remove just the single entry even if it is a folder).

Please note that the file name is relative the root folder in zip. That is, if the file you want to remove exists in a
folder called "folder1", which in-turn exists in a folder called "root-folder", removing this file from zip has to be done
as below:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").removeFile("root-folder/folder1/fileNameInZipToRemove");
```

If you want to be sure that the file you want to remove exists in zip file or if you don't want to deal with file names
as string when using the `removeFile` API, you can use the other overloaded method which takes in a `FileHeader`:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("someZip.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("fileNameInZipToRemove");

if (fileHeader == null) {
  // file does not exist
}

zipFile.removeFile(fileHeader);
```

Since v2.5.0 of Zip4j, it is possible to remove multiple files and folders from a zip file. You can now pass in a list
as shown in the code below:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("someZip.zip");
List<String> filesToRemove = Arrays.asList("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "some-folder/", "some-new-folder-1/somefile.pdf");

zipFile.removeFiles(filesToRemove);
```

The above code will remove `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, all files and folders under `some-folder` (including `some-folder`)
and just the entry `somefile.pdf` in folder `some-new-folder-1`. All other files and folders are kept intact in the zip
file.

### Rename entries in the zip file

There are three ways to rename an entry in a zip file with Zip4j. One way is to pass in a file header and the new file
name:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("sample.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("entry-to-be-changed.pdf");
zipFile.renameFile(fileHeader, "new-file-name.pdf");
```

Second way is to pass in just the file name to be changed (instead of the file header), and the new file name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("entry-to-be-changed.pdf", "new-file-name.pdf");
```

It is also possible to change multiple file names at once. In this case you have to use a map, with the key of the entry
in the map being the entry to be changed, and the value of the map being the new file name:

```
Map<String, String> fileNamesMap = new HashMap<>();
fileNamesMap.put("firstFile.txt", "newFileFirst.txt");
fileNamesMap.put("secondFile.pdf", "newSecondFile.pdf");
fileNamesMap.put("some-folder/thirdFile.bin", "some-folder/newThirdFile.bin");
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFiles(fileNamesMap);
```

To modify an entry name which is inside a folder, the new file name should contain the complete parent path as well.
For example, if an entry by the name `some-entry.pdf` is in the folder `some-folder/some-sub-folder/`, to modify this
entry name to `some-new-entry.pdf`:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "some-folder/some-sub-folder/new-entry.pdf");
```

If the parent path is missing, then the file will be put at the root of the zip file. In the below example, after
the file is renamed, `some-new-entry.pdf` will exist at the root of the zip file instead of at `some-folder/some-sub-folder/`:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "some-new-entry.pdf");
```

This also gives the flexibility to "move" the entry to a different folder. The below example will move the
`some-entry.pdf` from `some-folder/some-sub-folder/` to `folder-to-be-moved-to/sub-folder/` and the file will also be
renamed to `new-entry.pdf`. To just move the file, use the same file name instead of a new file name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "folder-to-be-moved-to/sub-folder/new-entry.pdf");
```

If the entry being modified is a directory, all entries that are part of that directory will be renamed so that all of
them have the new folder name as parent. In zip format, all entry names under a directory will contain the full name as their file name.
For example if there is an entry by the name `filename.txt` inside a directory `directoryName`, the file name for the entry
will be `directoryName/filename.txt`. And if the name of the directory has now been changed to `newDirectoryName`, the
entry under it will also be changed to `newDirectoryName/filename.txt`, so when the zip file is extracted,
`filename.txt` will be under `newDirectoryName`.

Zip file format does not allow modifying split zip files, and Zip4j will throw an exception if an attempt is made to
rename files in a split zip file.

### Merging split zip files into a single zip

This is the reverse of creating a split zip file, that is, this feature will merge a zip file which is split across
several files into a single zip file:

```
new ZipFile("split_zip_file.zip").mergeSplitFiles(new File("merged_zip_file.zip"));
```

This method will throw an exception if the split zip file (in this case `split_zip_file.zip`) is not a split zip file.

### List all files in a zip

```
List<FileHeader> fileHeaders = new ZipFile("zipfile.zip").getFileHeaders();
fileHeaders.stream().forEach(fileHeader -> System.out.println(fileHeader.getFileName()));
```

You can get all other information from the `FileHeader` object corresponding to each file/entry in the zip.

### Check if a zip file is password protected

```
new ZipFile("encrypted_zip_file.zip").isEncrypted();
```

### Check if a zip file is a split zip file

```
new ZipFile("split_zip_file.zip").isSplitArchive();
```

### Set comment for a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").setComment("Some comment");
```

### Remove comment of a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").setComment("");
```

### Get comment of a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").getComment();
```

### Check if a zip file is valid

Note: This will only check for the validity of the headers and not the validity of each entry in the zip file.

```
new ZipFile("valid_zip_file.zip").isValidZipFile();
```

## Working with streams

### Adding entries with ZipOutputStream

```
import net.lingala.zip4j.io.outputstream.ZipOutputStream;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.ZipParameters;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.enums.AesKeyStrength;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.enums.CompressionMethod;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.enums.EncryptionMethod;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.List;

public class ZipOutputStreamExample {

  public void zipOutputStreamExample(File outputZipFile, List<File> filesToAdd, char[] password,
                                     CompressionMethod compressionMethod, boolean encrypt,
                                     EncryptionMethod encryptionMethod, AesKeyStrength aesKeyStrength)
      throws IOException {

    ZipParameters zipParameters = buildZipParameters(compressionMethod, encrypt, encryptionMethod, aesKeyStrength);
    byte[] buff = new byte[4096];
    int readLen;

    try(ZipOutputStream zos = initializeZipOutputStream(outputZipFile, encrypt, password)) {
      for (File fileToAdd : filesToAdd) {

        // Entry size has to be set if you want to add entries of STORE compression method (no compression)
        // This is not required for deflate compression
        if (zipParameters.getCompressionMethod() == CompressionMethod.STORE) {
          zipParameters.setEntrySize(fileToAdd.length());
        }

        zipParameters.setFileNameInZip(fileToAdd.getName());
        zos.putNextEntry(zipParameters);

        try(InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(fileToAdd)) {
          while ((readLen = inputStream.read(buff)) != -1) {
            zos.write(buff, 0, readLen);
          }
        }
        zos.closeEntry();
      }
    }
  }

  private ZipOutputStream initializeZipOutputStream(File outputZipFile, boolean encrypt, char[] password)
      throws IOException {

    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(outputZipFile);

    if (encrypt) {
      return new ZipOutputStream(fos, password);
    }

    return new ZipOutputStream(fos);
  }

  private ZipParameters buildZipParameters(CompressionMethod compressionMethod, boolean encrypt,
                                           EncryptionMethod encryptionMethod, AesKeyStrength aesKeyStrength) {
    ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
    zipParameters.setCompressionMethod(compressionMethod);
    zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(encryptionMethod);
    zipParameters.setAesKeyStrength(aesKeyStrength);
    zipParameters.setEncryptFiles(encrypt);
    return zipParameters;
  }
}
```

### Extract files with ZipInputStream

```
import net.lingala.zip4j.io.inputstream.ZipInputStream;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.LocalFileHeader;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class ZipInputStreamExample {

  public void extractWithZipInputStream(File zipFile, char[] password) throws IOException {
    LocalFileHeader localFileHeader;
    int readLen;
    byte[] readBuffer = new byte[4096];

    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(zipFile);
    try (ZipInputStream zipInputStream = new ZipInputStream(inputStream, password)) {
      while ((localFileHeader = zipInputStream.getNextEntry()) != null) {
        File extractedFile = new File(localFileHeader.getFileName());
        try (OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(extractedFile)) {
          while ((readLen = zipInputStream.read(readBuffer)) != -1) {
            outputStream.write(readBuffer, 0, readLen);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Working with Progress Monitor

ProgressMonitor makes it easier for applications (especially user facing) to integrate Zip4j. It is useful to show
progress (example: updating a progress bar, displaying the current action, show file name being worked on, etc.). To use
ProgressMonitor, you have to set `ZipFile.setRunInThread(true)`. This will make any actions being done on the zip file
to run in a background thread. You can then access ProgressMonitor `Zipfile.getProgressMonitor()` and get details of the
current action being done along with the percentage work done, etc. Below is an example:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(generatedZipFile, PASSWORD);
ProgressMonitor progressMonitor = zipFile.getProgressMonitor();

zipFile.setRunInThread(true);
zipFile.addFolder(new File("/some/folder"));

while (!progressMonitor.getState().equals(ProgressMonitor.State.READY)) {
  System.out.println("Percentage done: " + progressMonitor.getPercentDone());
  System.out.println("Current file: " + progressMonitor.getFileName());
  System.out.println("Current task: " + progressMonitor.getCurrentTask());

  Thread.sleep(100);
}

if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.SUCCESS)) {
  System.out.println("Successfully added folder to zip");
} else if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.ERROR)) {
  System.out.println("Error occurred. Error message: " + progressMonitor.getException().getMessage());
} else if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.CANCELLED)) {
  System.out.println("Task cancelled");
}
```

Note that in the above example, `addFolder()` will almost immediately return back the control to the caller. The client
code can then perform a loop until the state gets back to "Ready" as shown in the above example.

Similarly, ProgressMonitor can be used with other actions like, `addFiles`, `removeFiles` and `extractFiles`.

## Contribution

It is hard to find as much free time as I used to have when I first started Zip4j back in 2009. I would
highly appreciate any support I can get for this project. You can fork this project, and send me pull requests for
any bug fixes, issues mentioned here or new features. If you need any support in understanding the code or zip specification,
just drop me a mail and I will help you as best as I can. (See FAQ for my email address.)

## FAQ

1. **Why do I have to pass in password as char array and not as a string?**

   [That's why](https://www.baeldung.com/java-storing-passwords)
2. **How can I contact you?**

   srikanth.mailbox@gmail.com
3. **Are unicode file names supported?**

   Yes, unicode file names (UTF-8) are supported as specified by the zip format specification. Zip4j will use UTF-8 file
   name and file comment encoding when creating a zip file. When extracting a zip file, Zip4j will only use UTF-8 encoding,
   only if the appropriate header flag is set as specified by zip file format specification. If this flag is not set,
   Zip4j will use CP437 encoding which only supports extended ASCII characters.
4. **Where can I find zip file format specification?**

   [Here](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)
5. **Why are there so many changes in version 2.x compared to 1.x?**

   Because when version 1.x was written back in 2009, Zip4j was badly in need of a face-lift and code modernization. Also, my
   coding standards have improved over the years (or at least that's what I like to think). Although I am proud of
   the work I did with Zip4j back in 2009, some parts of the code make me feel like hiding my face in shame. One such example
   is the usage of `ArrayList` instead of `List`. API and code should look much neater now. And also, Zip4j now supports
   a minimum of JRE 8, as compared to JRE 5 with 1.x, which obviously will bring some nice features that I can make use of. (For
   example: no more explicitly closing the streams all over the code). If you still feel like something can be improved (and
   I am pretty sure that there are things to be improved), please let me know by opening an issue here or writing to me
   (my email address is in point #2 above).
6. **What are the licensing conditions for older releases of Zip4j?**

   All releases of Zip4j, from version 1.0, are licensed under Apache License 2.0

# [Statement on ETH Findings](/en/blog/posts/news-alleged-weaknesses-statement)

January 9, 2023
·
[Deutsche Version](/de/blog/posts/news-angebliche-schwachstellen-statement)

*Updated 2023-01-10, 20:53 CET (Added TL;DR box, clarified lead)*

### TL;DR

* Researchers of ETH Zurich have published a paper on Threema’s communication protocol.
* We have acknowledged the issues mentioned in the paper and would like to thank the researchers for their efforts.
* We have resolved all issues within a few weeks.
* The introduction of a new protocol (“Ibex”) was planned for some time and coincided with the disclosure period of the researchers.
* All apps have been updated with the improvements.

**Last year, a student at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich wrote his master’s thesis on Threema’s communication protocol. ETH Zurich has now published his work as a paper/preprint. The presented findings have been addressed or no longer apply to Threema’s current communication protocol “Ibex.” None of them ever had any considerable real-world impact.**

For bringing the findings to our attention and for spending several months analyzing Threema’s cryptography, we would like to thank Kien Tuong Truong and his supervisors, Prof. Kenny Paterson and Matteo Scarlata of the Applied Cryptography Group at ETH Zurich.

While some of the findings presented in the paper may be interesting from a theoretical standpoint, **none of them ever
had any considerable real-world
impact**. Most assume extensive and unrealistic prerequisites that would have far greater consequences than the respective finding itself.

One such prerequisite is, for example, physical access to an unlocked Android device over a period of about twelve hours (with no passphrase set in Threema). In a scenario like this, the entire device must be considered compromised, and it follows a fortiori that Threema must also be considered compromised. For any app can only ever be as secure as the device/OS it runs on.

Despite the theoretical nature of these findings and as part of our continued commitment to maintain our strict standards of integrity and security, we have implemented appropriate measures to address those findings that were not already rendered irrelevant by the Ibex protocol (see [Technical Details](#details)).

* To learn more about Threema’s cryptographic communication protocol “Ibex,” which was developed over the course of 1.5 years and supports Perfect Forward Secrecy on the end-to-end layer, please [refer to this blog post](/en/blog/posts/ibex).

Before we discuss each finding in detail, here’s a summary:

* One finding (#5) isn’t new but had already been discovered some time ago by a security researcher and was addressed
  way back in 2021 (as the author of this paper was aware of).
* One finding (#1) is of purely theoretical interest and has no practicable applicability whatsoever.
* Four findings (#3, 4, 6, and 7) assume a very broad threat model and extensive prerequisites such as physical
  access to an unlocked mobile device over an extended time period or direct access to the unlocked Threema app.
* One finding (#2) relies on social engineering, could not have been applied in practice, and would have required deliberate, extensive, and unusual cooperation by the targeted user.

### Bug Bounty Program

The Threema apps are [open source](https://threema.ch/open-source), and security researchers can subject them to independent reviews at any time. A bug bounty of up to CHF 10,000 awaits those who come up with a [relevant security finding](https://gobugfree.com/programs/threema). In addition to that, external experts are regularly commissioned to [conduct systematic security audits](https://threema.ch/en/faq/code_audit).

## Technical Details

### Finding 1 (C2S Ephemeral Key Compromise)

This theoretical finding would have allowed an adversary who has somehow managed to obtain an ephemeral
private key used for connecting to the chat server, as well as a session transcript, to impersonate
the user towards the chat server and thus view metadata of received messages and prevent selected
messages from being delivered.

In practice, in order to obtain the ephemeral private key, the
adversary would have needed the ability to read app memory contents or influence the device’s random
number generator – at which point the adversary would have many other options to intercept any
information processed by the user’s device in any app.

Thus, there is no practicability at all. No way of obtaining an ephemeral private key was found, even
with physical access to the targeted user’s unlocked device.

* Current app versions (Threema ≥5.0 for Android and Threema ≥4.8.5 for iOS) replace the legacy chat
  server authentication procedure (which was modelled after CurveCP) with a new protocol that
  solves this issue (along with finding 2). Ephemeral key caching has also been completely
  removed.

### Finding 2 (Vouch Box Forgery)

This finding is described in two variants, both relying on social engineering, requiring extensive cooperation by the targeted user, and theoretically giving an adversary the opportunity to view metadata for incoming messages and prevent selected messages from being delivered.

* Both variants are not reproducible in practice as Threema’s chat server verifies the validity of public
  keys before accepting them. Current app versions (Threema ≥5.0 for Android and Threema ≥4.8.5 for iOS)
  replace the legacy chat server authentication procedure with a new protocol that resolves the root issue
  with both variants (along with finding 1).

#### Finding 2a (Vouch Box Forgery – Threema Gateway)

This variant exploits a payload confusion issue in the legacy chat server authentication procedure combined
with the use of a Threema Gateway ID with a specifically chosen public key.

An adversary would have needed to do all of the following:

* Apply and pay for a Threema Gateway ID with a public key equivalent (for ECDH purposes) to the current
  chat server public key.
* Spend the computing power of about 8,000 CPU cores for one week to find a Curve25519 private key whose
  corresponding public key has a certain form that allows it to be expressed in a text message.
* Convince the targeted user to send this specially crafted “garbage” text message to the adversary’s
  Threema Gateway ID on average about 200 times for the exploit to work with adequate probability.

As this variant requires the purchase of a Threema Gateway ID with a specifically chosen public key, we can
confirm that no such Gateway IDs exist, other than those created by the paper’s author. Therefore, there has
never been an attempt to create such a Gateway ID in the wild. We have blocked the creation of new Gateway
IDs with such public keys, rendering exploitation impossible.

Note that the adversary could not send any messages from their Threema Gateway ID (as they do not have the
corresponding private key) and thus would have needed to use another channel or another Threema ID to communicate with
the targeted user.

Threema OnPrem is not affected by this theoretical issue, as it requires administrative access to the
on-premises server instance for the creation of Gateway IDs.

#### Finding 2b (Vouch Box Forgery – Android data backup)

This variant exploits a bug in a common ZIP library for Java (Zip4j). However, the prerequisites for this
variant are so numerous and difficult to meet that a successful exploit would be extremely unlikely.
Specifically, an adversary would need to do **all** of the following:

* Obtain read and write access to the ZIP data backup created by a user of the Android version of the
  Threema app.
* Know where in the encrypted and compressed contact list backup inside the ZIP file his public key is
  stored. It could be anywhere in a range of typically several thousand bytes; the adversary needs to
  guess blindly, must hit the exact byte offset and typically only gets one chance (see below).
* Overwrite the location thus found/guessed, XORing in the difference between their own (compressed)
  public key and the server’s public key (as ZIP encryption uses AES-CTR). The fact that the backup data
  is compressed further complicates the exploit to the point where the adversary would essentially need to
  know the entire exact backup contents in advance.
* Wait for (or entice) the user to restore their Threema app data from the tampered backup ZIP. If the
  offset guessed in the second step is wrong, then the exploit will not work.
* Convince the targeted user to send a specially crafted “garbage” text message to the adversary’s Threema
  ID on average about 200 times for the exploit to work with adequate probability.

### Finding 3 (Message Reordering and Omission)

A compromised Threema server could reorder or omit messages while they are in transit.

* Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) has been introduced last year with our new Ibex protocol. The paper
  describes the situation prior to Ibex. With PFS, reordered or missing messages are detected, and the
  user is warned.

Note that even in 1:1 chats without PFS, omissions would be apparent to the sender anyway as they will not
receive a delivery receipt. Also, reordering is only possible while a bundle of messages is in transit
(typically messages are delivered/pushed immediately and individually as soon as they have been
transmitted).

### Finding 4 (Replay and Reflection)

A compromised Threema server could replay or reflect messages to a user who has lost their nonce database
due to reinstalling the app. Only messages received prior to reinstallation could be replayed or reflected.

* Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) has been introduced last year with our new Ibex protocol. The paper
  describes the situation prior to Ibex. With PFS, replayed/reflected messages are detected and dropped
  even if the user has lost the nonce database.

### Finding 5 (Kompromat)

A compromised Threema directory server could theoretically trick a client into encrypting an arbitrary
message to another user.

* This is an old finding discovered by another researcher (Jonathan Krebs) and already addressed by Threema in
  2021 (as the author of this paper was aware of). Furthermore, in current app versions (Threema ≥5.0 for Android and Threema ≥4.8.5 for iOS), the
  legacy directory server authentication procedure has been replaced.

### Finding 6 (Cloning via Threema ID Export)

If a targeted user handed a completely unprotected and unlocked device to the adversary and the app had no PIN
or biometric protection set, the adversary could, by design, clone the user’s Threema ID by means of the ID
export feature. However, had the adversary connected to the Threema server at the same time as the targeted user, the latter would have been notified.

The ID export feature is designed to let users take control of their private key so they can move their
Threema ID to another device without losing it when they switch to a new device. As Threema does
intentionally not have traditional accounts tied to a username/password or a phone number, the app assumes
that whoever has the unlocked device and also knows the app PIN (if set) is authorized to export the ID.

Users can easily guard against this issue by setting an app PIN or enabling biometric protection. Threema
Work and OnPrem admins also have fine-grained control over their users’ backup/export capability via MDM
parameters (`th_disable_id_export` and others).

* To ensure that the user will be informed even if a private key has been compromised due to careless
  actions by the user, we have further improved the detection method that will alert the user if there has
  been any connection using their Threema ID from another device since the last time that they used the
  app.

### Finding 7 (Private Key Recovery through Compression Side-Channel)

This finding exploits a compression oracle in the generation of Threema Safe backup data to recover the
private key of the Threema ID. It would have required physical access to an unlocked device for an extended
period of time (in the order of twelve hours) and would have only worked in the Android version of the app (due
to implementation details) and also only if no passphrase was set in the app.

* Threema Safe compression is disabled in current app versions (Threema ≥5.0 for Android and Threema ≥4.8.5 for iOS), thus resolving this issue.

Abstract
We provide an extensive cryptographic analysis of Threema,
a Swiss-based encrypted messaging application with more
than 10 million users and 7000 corporate customers. We
present seven different attacks against the protocol in three
different threat models. We discuss impact and remediations
for our attacks, which have all been disclosed to Threema
and patched. Finally, we draw wider lessons for developers
of secure protocols.

1 Introduction

Threema is a Swiss encrypted messaging application. It has
more than 10 million users [32] and more than 7,000 on-
premise customers [35]. It is among the top Android apps in
Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Canada, and Australia in the
“paid for” category [8]. It has undergone independent security
audits [38, 37]. Along with Signal and Telegram, Threema
was widely advertised as a more secure alternative to What-
sApp [56, 24, 57] in the wake of Facebook’s acquisition of the
company [24] and of the January 2021 change in WhatsApp
Terms of Service [31, 61]. Threema is the messaging app of
choice of the Swiss Government and of the Swiss Army [25],
where its use is mandated for all official communications [59].
Threema is also used by German politicians, including the
current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz [52]. The company behind
Threema makes strong claims for its security [34] and adver-
tises its Swiss, non-US jurisdiction as a virtue.1

In general, secure messaging protocols are designed to
provide end-to-end encrypted communication between two
(or more) parties. Modern designs like Signal achieve not only
confidentiality, integrity, origin authentication and verification
of correct ordering of the exchanged messages, but also:

• session key security: compromise of a session key or
ephemeral values in one session should not affect the
security of keys in other, parallel sessions;

1Quoting from [32]: “Threema is 100% Swiss Made, hosts its own servers
in Switzerland, and, unlike US services [. . . ] it is fully GDPR-compliant. . .

• fine-grained perfect forward secrecy (PFS): compro-
mise of session keys in an on-going session should not
affect security of earlier keys and exchanged messages
in that session and compromise of long-term keys should
not undermine the security of completed sessions; and

• post-compromise security (PCS): after a compromise
of all key material, it should be possible to regain secu-
rity after a protocol execution, provided the adversary is
passive during that execution.

Such properties have been established for Signal for two-party
messaging [14, 41, 15, 21].

At the same time, the current landscape of messaging apps
includes a wide variety of solutions, with different trade-offs
with respect to centralization and federation, company juris-
diction, ease of use, openness of design and code, and security
guarantees provided by the underlying cryptographic proto-
cols. The absence of a standard for secure messaging means
that many of the contenders feature bespoke cryptographic
protocols with unclear security guarantees [7, 4, 6]. Indeed,
these security guarantees are often much weaker than those
provided by Signal, which can be seen as a providing a “gold
standard” for secure messaging.

1.1 Our Contributions

We provide the first in-depth security analysis of the cryptogra-
phy used in Threema, focussing on its protocols for securing
end-to-end (E2E) and client-to-server (C2S) communications,
for user registration, and for backing up users’ private keys.
We also examine the interactions between these protocols.

Our analysis uncovers seven different attacks against
Threema, in three different threat models (as depicted in Fig-
ure 1). One of the attacks was discovered before us by Krebs,
disclosed to Threema and patched in December 2021 [33].
We include it here for completeness. We produced proof-of-
concept implementations for most of the attacks to verify that
they work. We summarise the threat models and attacks next.

1

In the “external actor” threat model we consider attacks by
outsiders with no special access to Threema servers or clients.
Here, we found two attacks:

1. An adversary who is able to compromise a single
ephemeral value used by a client in the C2S protocol
is able to permanently impersonate that client to the
server, and through this, access the metadata for all E2E-
protected messages. This strongly violates the expected
security properties of a well-designed protocol.

2. An adversary is able to register the server’s public key as
a user public key and, by tricking the victim into sending
a single carefully crafted message in the E2E protocol,
can obtain a value that enables it to again permanently
impersonate the victim to the server in the C2S protocol.

In the “compromised Threema” threat model we consider
attacks by an adversary who has gained access to Threema
servers. Such access should not enable breaking the end-to-
end security guarantees. Here, we describe three attacks:

3. Due to peculiarities in nonce-handling in the E2E proto-
col, the adversary is able to arbitrarily and undetectably
reorder and/or delete messages sent from any client to
any other client.

4. Again, due to how nonces are handled in the E2E pro-
tocol, Threema clients must keep a local database of all
nonces used in sending and receiving messages. This
database is deleted when a user reinstalls the app or
changes devices. After such an action, the adversary can
replay old messages. Because of poor key separation,
the adversary can also send back to user Alice any old
messages originally sent by Alice.

5. For registration, a client proves possession of its private
key by encrypting a server-chosen message to a server-
chosen public key using the E2E encryption mechanism.
This process is invisible to the user. This allows a mali-
cious server to create “Kompromat”: a potentially incrim-
inating message that can be delivered at any later time
to a target user. This is the attack that we rediscovered.

In the “compelled access” threat model, we consider attacks
by actors with direct access to a user’s device, for example
law enforcement officers or border guards. We present two
attacks in this setting:

6. A trivial attack exploiting a Threema feature allowing
users to easily export a backup of their long-term pri-
vate key protected under a chosen password. Because
of Threema’s design, this key can be used to clone a
Threema account and, through this, silently access all
the user’s future messages. In conjunction with a compro-
mised Threema server, all old messages can be accessed
too. This attack is only possible when the app and mobile
device are both unlocked.

1. External Actor

3. Compelled Access

2. Compromised Threema

Figure 1: In the threat models we consider, the attacker can
have access to network communication (1), the Threema
servers (2) or the victim device itself (3).

7. A more sophisticated attack exploiting one of Threema’s
backup mechanisms; this attack does not (by default)
require an unlocked app (but does need an unlocked
mobile device). It exploits Threema’s use of “compress-
then-encrypt” when creating the backup, in combination
with the ability of the adversary to inject chosen strings
into the backup file through Threema nicknames. By ob-
serving the size of the backup file over many operations
with chosen nicknames, the adversary can recover the
user’s private key, with the same consequences as above.

Attacks 1 and 2 do not, by themselves, leak plaintext, but
they target metadata that, under normal circumstances, only
the server should be able to access. Furthermore, they break
the PFS guarantees of Threema, allowing plaintext to be re-
covered if the long-term key of a user is ever exposed. Attacks
3, 4, and 5 show that the Threema server has the power to
undetectably disrupt conversations, despite the E2E proto-
col (which, however, still guarantees message confidentiality).
This requires users to put excessive trust in the server. Attacks
6 and 7 allow an attacker to obtain future plaintexts, as well
as recover past plaintexts that are not protected by the C2S
layer; however, they do require access to an end device. Our
attacks are not directly caused by Threema’s lack of PFS and
PCS, but they showcase how such a deficiency can amplify
the impact of smaller attacks. The attacks range in practicality.
For example, attack 6 is feasible for an unskilled attacker that
has access to the device for a very short time, while attack 1
is more of theoretical interest. See Table 1 for a summary of
the attacks’ prerequisites and impacts.

In totality, our attacks seriously undermine Threema’s secu-
rity claims. In particular, we show that Threema’s approach to
PFS (i.e. only providing it at the message transport layer) is in-
sufficient even against a network attacker. All the attacks can
be mitigated, but in some cases, a major redesign is needed.
We discuss appropriate mitigations and the remediations un-
dertaken by Threema, after presenting the attacks.

We also draw three wider lessons for developers of secure
protocols: using secure libraries for cryptographic primitives
does not on its own lead to a secure protocol design; beware
of cross-protocol interactions; and adopt a proactive rather
than reactive approach to secure protocol design.

1.2 Related Work

An independent early analysis of the Threema client-to-server
protocol, dating back to the closed-source Threema version
1.3, was carried out by Ahrens [2], and was the basis for
an open-source implementation by Berger [10]. We analyse
the current version (version 4.831) of the Threema Android
application, and base our analysis of the protocol on the 2020
open-source release of the Threema app [29] and the Threema
security whitepaper [30].

Rösler et al. [54] considered the end-to-end security of
group chats in various secure instant messaging services, in-
cluding Threema. They observed the lack of forward secrecy
and post-compromise security for Threema group chats, and
described two attacks: a replay attack on group messages, and
leakage of group membership information to non-members.
Both attacks have since been patched by Threema.

Cremers et al. [18] investigated the security of Threema
(and other apps) in a black-box post-compromise setting, by
cloning a victim device and observing whether the clone re-
tains access to exchanged messages. The authors note that
Threema prevents the clone from accessing messages ex-
changed while the clone is offline. While this result holds in
a black-box setting, the weaknesses we uncover in Threema’s
client-to-server protocol enable even an adversary with lim-
ited technical proficiency to intercept messages if given access
to the full cloned state of the victim.

Threema itself commissioned two security audits [38, 37].
Both audits focused on the Android and iOS apps for Threema,
and do not touch on its cryptographic security beyond con-
firming that the implementation of the protocol matches the
description provided in the Threema whitepaper [30].

Soatok [58] highlighted Threema’s lack of forward secrecy
and transcript consistency in groups as deficiencies of the
app. The lack of transcript consistency is not yet resolved
by Threema, and, as [58] argues, can be combined with the
lack of robustness of the XSalsa20-Poly1305 AEAD cipher
to obtain “Invisible Salamander”-style attacks [19, 3]: an
attacker can send attachments in group chats that decrypt to
different plaintexts for different chat participants.

1.3 Ethical Considerations

We only used the description of Threema in [30] and the client-
side source code to conduct our analysis. We did not attempt
any reverse-engineering of the server behaviour other than
what could be observed passively through normal client in-
teraction. We performed experiments only with test accounts
under our full control; no other user accounts were targeted.
We reduced as much as possible the number of messages
sent to Threema servers, and we avoided sending malformed
messages to servers so as to avoid triggering DoS attacks.

We did purchase a “Threema Gateway” account (with
Threema ID *LYTAAAS) and registered a public key under

that account identical to the Threema server public key (obvi-
ously, without knowing the corresponding private key). This
step was necessary in order to validate one of our attacks
(Section 3.1.2). It did not violate any terms or conditions of
the service, so far as we could determine.

We disclosed the results in this paper to Threema on
03.10.2022, proposing a 90-day disclosure period. They ac-
knowledged receipt also on 03.10.2022. We agreed on the
details of the coordinated disclosure: a first batch of mitiga-
tions would be released in Q4 of 2022, while further mitiga-
tions would be released in Q1 of 2023, along with a post on
Threema’s blog. The first batch of mitigations were included
in Threema 5.0 for both Android and iOS2 on 29.11.2022. To
further remediate the issues we reported, Threema included
their custom protocol, Ibex, in the same release. The new
protocol aims to provide forward secrecy at the E2E layer.3
Threema also updated their whitepaper [30] on 15.12.2022 to
add discussion of the forward security feature. We have not
audited this new protocol. We agreed to publicly disclose our
findings on 09.01.2023. The current publicly released patches
address all of our attacks.

In one of our attacks, we leveraged a vulnerability in a
library, Zip4j, used by Threema to create backup zip files. We
disclosed our findings to the author of Zip4j on 08.10.2022,
proposing a 60-day disclosure period. A CVE advisory for the
bug (CVE-2023-22899) was published on 10.01.2023 [47]. A
fix was released in version 2.11.3 on 26.01.2023.

1.4 Paper Structure

In Section 2 we introduce the Threema architecture and pro-
vide a description of Threema’s core cryptographic protocols
and subsystems. Section 3 presents our attacks, grouped by
threat model. We propose mitigations in Section 4. We discuss
three wider lessons for secure protocol designers in Section 5.

2 Threema Architecture and Protocols

The design of Threema can be studied as the ensemble of
several interoperable cryptographic protocols, all sharing the
same user state and cryptographic primitives. The functional
core of Threema consists of an end-to-end (E2E) protocol,
which employs the long-term cryptographic secrets of the
users to encrypt messages, and a client-to-server (C2S) pro-
tocol, a secure channel protocol that protects these messages
in flight from clients to the Threema servers. Because of the
composition of these two protocols, each message is wrapped
in two layers of encryption: an inner end-to-end layer, and
an outer client-to-server layer. We depict the composition in
Fig. 2. Also relevant to our analysis and attacks are the regis-
tration protocol, data backup and contact discovery system.

We first describe the cryptographic primitives used by
Threema and establish our notation. Then we analyze the
registration protocol, the E2E protocol, and the C2S proto-
col. Finally, we briefly cover the backup mechanisms. For
completeness, we also include a description of the contact
discovery mechanism in Appendix A.

was used to decrypt.

We denote by k ← KDF(K, σ, τ) a Key Derivation Function
taking some key material K, a salt σ, and a label τ as input,
and producing key k as output. Threema uses a KDF based
on the Blake2b hash function [55].

2.1 Cryptographic Primitives and Notation

2.2 Registration Protocol

The protocols used by Threema rely on standard crypto-
graphic primitives. The main tool used is the crypto_box
abstraction provided by the Networking and Cryptography
Library (NaCl) [11] which consists of a Curve25519 Diffie-
Hellman key agreement, followed by encryption with an Au-
thenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algo-
rithm. The AEAD algorithm used by NaCl is the nonce-based
XSalsa20-Poly1305. As a convention, long-term keys will be
indicated with the same letter as the symbol for the user, with
the public key in uppercase and the private key in lowercase
(e.g. user A has private key a and public key A). We reserve
(x, X), (y,Y ), and (z, Z) for values used as ephemeral keys.

Let X25519(·) denote the NaCl function that takes a private
key and a public key, and outputs a shared secret byte string.
In NaCl, this string results from applying the hsalsa20 key
derivation function to the byte representation of the shared
elliptic curve point and a fixed nonce. Internally, the X25519
algorithm operates on the Curve25519 elliptic curve: the al-
gorithm uses 32-byte scalars as private keys and computes
the scalar multiplication of the chosen base point of the curve
g with the private key to obtain a 32-byte public key. We will
use multiplicative notation for such operations: e.g. secret
key a has a corresponding public key A = ga for some fixed
generator g. We denote by (x, X) ←$ KeyGen() the key gener-
ation procedure of Curve25519, which outputs a private key x
and a public key X = gx. Let K be an AEAD key; we denote
by EK(m; n) the encryption of message m under key K using
nonce n, and by DK(m; n) the corresponding decryption op-
eration. If the decryption fails, we assume that the algorithm
returns a special value ⊥. This may happen, for example, if
the ciphertext has been tampered with, or if the wrong key

In order to create a new account and register it with the
Threema server, each user generates a Curve25519 key pair
(a, A). The entropy for the generation of the key pair is taken
from system randomness, as well as random user input which
is processed and mixed with the former to obtain the 32-byte
private key a. The client later runs a registration protocol
with the server to prove knowledge of a. This is done via a
challenge-response exchange run over a TLS-protected con-
nection: the client sends A to the server. The server replies
with an ephemeral public key X and a message m. The client
computes K = X25519(a, X) and AEAD-encrypts m using K
and a fixed nonce (“createIdentity response.”) to create
a response. If this response decrypts correctly and yields m as
plaintext, the server accepts the registration and then issues a
new Threema ID, storing it along with the public key of the
user in the Threema database.

2.3 Threema End-to-End Protocol

The Threema E2E protocol, depicted in Figure 3, is con-
cerned with guaranteeing end-to-end security of messages.
Every user Ui of the protocol has an alphanumeric 8-character
identity IDUi (the Threema ID, or simply ID), a private
key ui, and a corresponding public key Ui = gui. Messages
sent from user Ui to user U j are encrypted under KUi,U j =
X25519(ui,U j) = X25519(u j,Ui), a static Diffie-Hellman
key. Note that the same key is derived by user Ui for U j as
the one from user U j for Ui: the key KUi,U j is bidirectional.
A message m is first serialized into a byte string, and pre-
fixed with a byte that indicates the message type. The specific
serialization method depends on the message itself. For in-

stance, a text message would be directly encoded as a byte
string representing the UTF-8 string, and prefixed with 0x01.
A random amount of PKCS7 padding, between 1 and 254
bytes, is appended to the message.The resulting plaintext
ptxt is then encrypted under K using the AEAD algorithm
with a random nonce, nonce, to obtain a ciphertext ctxt.

To create the final message packet, the following informa-
tion is prepended to the ciphertext: the Threema ID of the
sender src, and of the receiver dst, a random 8-byte message
ID msg-id, the timestamp at which the message was sent
timestamp, the nickname of the sender src-nick, the nonce
nonce and an optional metadata value. To construct this
metadata, the app takes the message ID, the nickname of the
sender and the timestamp, concatenates them, and encrypts
the resulting plaintext under KDF(K, “mm”, “3ma-csp”), us-
ing the same nonce value. Since the presence of the metadata
box is optional and it is not cryptographically bound to the
ciphertext, it can always be stripped off and its length set to
0 by an adversary. In Fig. 4 we depict the structure of an
E2E-encrypted packet in Threema.

When sending an E2E message, the associated random
nonce is stored in the device’s local storage in order to avoid
reusing it. If a generated nonce matches a nonce in the local
storage, up to five attempts are made to sample a new nonce.
When receiving a message, the app checks if the correspond-
ing nonce has already been seen: if so, it rejects the mes-
sage.If the nonce is otherwise fresh, the app tries to decrypt
the message, verifying the MAC tag as part of the process.
If successful, the app stores (a hashed representation of) the
nonce. This storage of nonces is aimed at preventing trivial
replay and reflection attacks (which would otherwise be pos-
sible since the key KUi,U j is bidirectional) and hedges against
the possibility of a faulty randomness source.

Remarkably, the E2E protocol does not provide any for-
ward secrecy, since it only uses the long-term keys of the users,
with no ephemeral values being exchanged. This means that
a malicious server could take advantage of its position to exe-
cute a “store now, decrypt later” attack. This has supposedly
been fixed with the introduction of the Ibex protocol.

2.4 Threema Client-to-Server Protocol

The Threema C2S protocol is concerned with establishing
a secure channel between a client and the server to protect
messages in flight, shielding metadata and the non-forward
secret E2E protocol messages from a network adversary. Note
that this protocol is only used for messaging: other function-
alities such as registration, backup, and contact matching are
implemented over TLS.

Threema’s C2S protocol is a novel secure channel protocol,
broadly comparable in function and construction to the TLS
protocol. It assumes a reliable transport, and can be decom-
posed as a handshake subprotocol, in which the server and the
client interact to establish a session key, and a transport sub-
protocol, where the server and the client use the established
session key to exchange messages.

The C2S protocol requires that each user connects to the
server from only one device at any given moment. If two
devices try to connect to the server at the same time, the older
connection is dropped in favour of the newer one. Before
terminating the connection, an error message is sent to the
device, informing it that another device has connected with
the same Threema ID.

2.4.1 Handshake Subprotocol

The handshake subprotocol runs between the server S (with
long-term key pair (s, S = gs)) and a client U (with long-term
key pair (u,U = gu)). Fig. 5 gives a pictorial representation
of the protocol. We refer to the figure for the naming of the
messages below. We can assume that the server and the client
already know each other’s public keys: the client knows the
server’s key as it is pinned in the app and the server receives
the client’s key at registration time.

The client first generates an ephemeral key pair (x, X = gx)
and a 16-byte value c called the client cookie, and sends (X, c)
to the server (client-hello). After receiving the client’s
ephemeral public key and the client cookie, the server gen-
erates its own ephemeral key pair (y,Y = gy) and a 16-byte
value called the server cookie. It then computes the first shared
symmetric key of the exchange K1 = X25519(s, X), mixing

the long-term key of the server with the ephemeral key of
the client, and uses it to encrypt its ephemeral public key
concatenated with the client cookie, using a random nonce n.
The server sends the resulting ciphertext, along with its own
cookie (server-hello).

The client and server cookies prevent replay attacks and
are used to initialize client and server counters. For each
counter, the most significant 16 bytes of the counter are set to
the respective cookie, while the lower 8 bytes function as a
monotonically increasing value. Subsequent AEAD nonces
for the exchanged messages are drawn from these counters.
When the client receives the message, it recomputes K1 and
checks if the ciphertext decrypts correctly and if the client
cookie in the plaintext corresponds to the one that the client
previously generated. If either check fails, it will abort the
protocol. The client and the server derive two additional keys:
K, obtained by combining the two ephemeral key pairs (x, X)
and (y,Y ), and K2, obtained by combining the two long-term
key pairs (u,U) and (s, S). The key K is used in the transport
subprotocol as the session key. The long-term symmetric key
K2 is used by the client to create the so-called vouch box
vouch ← EK2(X; n′) using a random nonce n′. The vouch box
is used by the server to authenticate the client, and to bind the

6

client’s ephemeral key X to the client’s identity.

The vouch box is concatenated with IDU and the server
cookie CS , and encrypted using the session key K (login).
The server decrypts the message with K and tries to decrypt
the vouch box with K2. If the decryption fails or the value
contained in the vouch box does not correspond to the client’s
ephemeral key, the server will abort the protocol. Otherwise,
the server sends a final confirmation message composed of 16
zero bytes, encrypted with the session key K (login-ack).

Taken as a standalone protocol, the C2S handshake could
be formally analysed using, for example, the extended Canetti-
Krawczyk security model [42] or the MSKE security model
of [26] that was used in [14, 15] to analyse Signal. We will
(informally) use these models when relating the attacks in
Section 3 to the formal security properties they violate.

2.4.2 Transport Subprotocol

In the transport subprotocol, the client and the server exchange
messages, encrypted using the session key K. The client and
server nonces are derived from the same (respective) coun-
ters inherited from the handshake subprotocol, ensuring that
handshake messages cannot be used as transport messages
(and vice versa). If a decryption fails, the entire connection
is dropped. This prevents message reordering and message
deletion by a network adversary, since either attack would
result in a party decrypting with a nonce different from the
correct one, and then the AEAD integrity guarantees would
ensure that an error is generated on decryption.

When the connection is dropped, the client attempts to
reconnect, with up to five reconnection attempts being made.
If these all fail, the app will display an error to the user and
will require a restart to be able to connect to the server. If two
devices are actively trying to connect to the server, they will
keep interfering with each other until one of them relinquishes
the connection. This is relevant for any attacker that wants to
attempt an impersonation attack, since using all five attempts
will alert the user that another device is trying to connect to
the server with the same Threema ID.

While the connection is alive, the server will send messages
that are meant for the user encrypted under the session key K.
The client replies with an ACK in response to each message.
If the client does not send an ACK, the server will try to send
the message again when the client later reconnects.

2.5 Threema Safe

Threema allows a user to activate, at any point in time, the
Threema Safe feature. This allows the user to backup their
long-term private key, their nickname, the list of their contacts
and additional account information on the Threema servers.
Note that the backup does not store any message history.

When the Threema Safe is first set up, the user chooses a
password for their backups. A minimum length of 8 characters

is enforced, and the password is checked against an offline list
of weak passwords. The app derives two 32-byte strings, the
Backup ID BID and the Backup Key BK, using scrypt with
the password as input and the Threema ID of the user as salt.
For every backup, the app creates a JSON payload containing
all the data to be backed up and serializes it into a byte string,
which is then compressed using gzip. Finally, the app encrypts
this compressed JSON string with XSalsa20-Poly1305 under
BK with a random nonce. The resulting ciphertext is sent to
the server over a TLS connection.

The server will store ciphertexts indexed by BID, suppos-
edly without any other information related to the user. In
the Threema whitepaper [30], the developers claim that this
process is designed to make it impossible for the Threema
Safe server to distinguish which backup comes from whom
by looking at the uploaded data. We note, however, that when
a backup is created the app is likely to have an active C2S
protocol session, which reveals the Threema ID of the user.
By linking the two connections coming from the same IP, the
server can learn the identity associated with a given backup.
A backup is scheduled to happen every day or, in case the
previous backup failed to be uploaded, as soon as the app is
restarted. This happens even if access to the app is protected
by a PIN or biometric login.

2.6 Other Backup Methods

Threema provides two additional methods to save personal
data: the first one is called a Threema ID export and the second
one is called a data backup.

The Threema ID export requires that the user provide a
password, which is used to derive a 32-byte symmetric key
by using the PBKDF2 algorithm with a random 8-byte salt.
This key is used to encrypt the ID of the user, as well as their
long-term private key using XSalsa20 with a zero nonce (but
with no integrity protection). The result is base32-encoded
and given to the user in order to be saved outside of the app.
A data backup consists of an encrypted zip containing

various files. The identity file stores the Threema ID and
the long-term key of the user; the contact file stores Threema
IDs, nicknames, and public keys of contacts in CSV form,
and for each chat, a file named with the Threema ID of the
correspondent stores the chat history. The zip is encrypted
following the WinZip AE-2 specification [16].

We note that, because WinZip does not hide the file names,
this encrypted zip leaks information about with whom the
user has been communicating. Due to the length of each file
being known, an attacker may also infer the length of the
conversation from the encrypted zip.

3 Attacks on Threema

We consider three threat models: first, an external actor who
can monitor communications between a device running the
app and the Threema servers; second, an actor that has com-
promised the Threema servers; third, an actor that can take
control of the device for a short period of time.

The first of these models corresponds to the standard adver-
sary for secure network protocols, often called the Dolev-Yao
adversary. We refer to it as the external actor threat model.

Concerning the second model, any reasonable security anal-
ysis must consider the possibility that the messaging server
is malicious: national security agencies and hacking groups
are tasked with penetrating servers like those run by Threema
in order to gain persistent access to concentrated amounts
of sensitive data. It is then reasonable to ask what security
guarantees remain for users in the event of such a breach. This
is especially so for a system that claims to provide end-to-end
security. We refer to this model as the compromised Threema
threat model.

We call the third model the compelled access threat model.
It is relevant, for example, in the case of border searches of
electronic devices, when protesters are detained by police
forces and searched for incriminating evidence, or in the set-
ting of intimate partner violence [27]. We may subdivide this
setting into two sub-cases: one where the app is locked, and

the other where it is unlocked (we will always assume the
device itself is unlocked).

We next introduce our attacks, grouped by threat model.

Table 1 summarizes our findings.

3.1 External Actor Threat Model

Our first two attacks allow the attacker to impersonate a vic-
tim in the C2S protocol. The core of both attacks lies in the
structure of the vouch box vouch. This is used in the protocol
to authenticate clients but contains only client-chosen fresh-
ness. By either replaying (Attack 1) or forging (Attack 2) a
user’s vouch box, the attacker can authenticate itself as that
user to the server. These impersonation attacks are permanent,
despite the fact that the attacker never learns the value of the
victim’s long-term key.

Our attacks show that the weak notion of forward secrecy
achieved by Threema is insufficient: by using either of our
attacks, the adversary gains access to E2E-encrypted mes-
sages, which use long-term keys only. The reuse of ephemeral
keys which we describe in the first attack further weakens
the guarantees given by forward secrecy, since an attacker
gains access to messages up to a week in the past. Comparing
this design to Signal’s, we note that in the latter each E2E
message is encrypted with a different key, providing a much
stronger, fine-grained notion of forward secrecy.

3.1.1 Attack 1 (C2S Ephemeral Key Compromise)

Assumptions: We assume that the attacker has discovered
one of the ephemeral keys x used by the client in a C2S
handshake session. This capability is commonly referred
to in formal security models as ephemeral key reveal, and
it can arise in practice from a randomness failure or via a

side-channel attack. We further assume that the attacker has
passively recorded the corresponding C2S session.

Execution: We now show that, with the knowledge of x
and the C2S session transcript, the attacker can create new
sessions with the server in which they impersonate the victim
and can tamper with the flow of messages.

As highlighted in Figure 6, the attacker has all the material
necessary to derive K1 and decrypt the login message from
the recorded C2S protocol run, from which it can recover the
value of vouch. Now the attacker initiates a new run of the
C2S protocol, playing the role of the victim user. In this run
it replays the ephemeral public value X. A new session key
K′ known to the attacker is generated (the server should send
a fresh Y ′ in its server-hello but the attacker still knows
x). The attacker can then reuse vouch (without learning K2)
when constructing its response in the login message, which
makes the handshake complete successfully. We have verified
that the server does not detect such replays.

Impact: Since vouch can be reused repeatedly, this attack
(involving the loss of just a single ephemeral value) allows
the attacker to permanently impersonate the victim user to
the server, enabling the attacker access to all E2E-encrypted
messages meant for the victim. Despite the E2E layer of en-
cryption, this still reveals the metadata information in all com-
munications sent to the victim, allowing the attacker to learn
with whom and when the victim has been communicating.

Most importantly, this attack leads to a break of the forward
secrecy property that the C2S protocol is intended to provide.
Indeed, the E2E-encrypted messages that the attacker now
sees are encrypted only using long-term keys. Full decryption
of those messages becomes possible if the victim’s long-term
key is later revealed (for example through attacks 6 or 7).

In addition, the attacker gains the opportunity to selectively
drop messages from the conversation by deciding which mes-
sages to ACK to the server. If a message is ACK-ed by the
attacker, it will not be received by the victim when they next
connect to the server, virtually deleting that message from the
conversation on the victim’s end.

We stress that, as long as the attacker and the victim do not
connect to the server at the same time, this attack is not de-
tectable by the victim. If they were to connect at the same time,
the attacker could observe error messages from the server to
learn this. At this point, the attacker can relinquish the con-
nection in order to avoid detection.

This attack shows that, for the C2S protocol, ephemeral
keys are as important to protect as long-term keys. This is a
very strong assumption to have to make in order to guarantee
security for a key exchange protocol.

We note that a similar vulnerability was present in the
Off-The-Record (OTR) protocol [51]. The authors of [51]
highlight the consequent lack of the session independence
property in OTR: “the exposure of ephemeral session-specific
secrets should have no bearing on the security of other ses-

8

sions”. Threema’s C2S protocol suffers from the same issue.

Non-ephemeral Ephemerals: An additional problem with
the C2S protocol lies in how the ephemeral keys are han-
dled client-side: if the app is never restarted, then the same
ephemeral key is used by the client for up to seven days be-
fore generating a new one. Leaking such a re-used ephemeral
key then allows an attacker to also impersonate the server to
the user by forging a server-hello using the server’s public
key and the compromised ephemeral key (this is known as
an ephemeral Key Compromise Impersonation attack in the
literature). In turn, this implies that the attacker has the power
to also read the outbound E2E-encrypted messages of the
victim that are meant for the real Threema server. This reveals
additional metadata, allows the attacker to drop arbitrary mes-
sages and allows a network adversary to execute attacks that
would otherwise be in the “compromised Threema” threat
model, such as the ones described in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
If ephemeral keys were to be freshly generated for each hand-
shake, this problem would be confined to the single compro-
mised session. However, by reusing the same ephemeral key
for a long time, the effect of this attack is heavily amplified.
Finally, there is similar reuse of ephemeral keys on the
server side. We noticed that whenever the same ephemeral
key X is used multiple times by a user within a short span of
time, the server will use the same ephemeral key Y as well. An
attacker is thus able to force the same session key to be used
for a long time by regularly connecting to the server with
the same value X. We note that compromising said server
ephemerals would allow the impersonation of multiple users
to Threema for an indefinite period of time, as long as the
attacker has recorded C2S handshakes involving the revealed
ephemeral keys. In fact, it suffices for the attacker to replay
the client-hello, inducing the server to reuse a previously
revealed key y. As the attacker can compute the session key,
they can create a new login message, which contains an old
vouch box, thus completing the handshake.

In order to test all these weaknesses, we created a Python
script which, given a valid transcript of a C2S handshake and
the client ephemeral key used, can impersonate the user to the
server. The script shows all the metadata of incoming mes-
sages and can drop arbitrary messages from the conversation.

3.1.2 Attack 2 (Vouch Box Forgery)

An alternative route to achieve the same goal as the previous
attack is to forge a new vouch box containing an ephemeral
key X for which the adversary knows the private value x. This
is feasible due to a cross-protocol interaction between the E2E
and the C2S protocols. The consequence is that the attacker
again gains the ability to permanently impersonate the victim.

Assumptions: The attack requires two steps. In the first
step, the attacker E has the victim use the public key S of
the C2S protocol server when communicating with E in the
E2E protocol. In the second step, the attacker, now acting as a

Figure 7: Attack 2: a cross-protocol interaction of an E2E and
a C2S session. The attacker claims the public key of the server,
and knows a keypair of the form (z, Z = 0x01 ∥ σ ∥ 0x01).
They convinced the victim U to send σ to them as a E2E
text message (in blue, Left side). The attacker can now start a
session of the C2S protocol (Right side) where they use the
“ephemeral” keypair (z, Z) and the corresponding vouch box
EK2(Z) (in blue) in order to authenticate as U to the server.

Threema user, has the victim user send a specifically crafted
text message to the attacker in the E2E protocol. Under normal
circumstances, these actions should not lead to an attack: if
the victim sends a message encrypted against the server’s
public key, then the attacker should not be able to decrypt it,
nor use it for other purposes. Furthermore, sending an E2E
message should not compromise security of the C2S protocol.
We will show two different methods to implement the first
step of the attack. In the first method, we use part of the
infrastructure of Threema to create a new account which has
the server’s public key S as its own public key. In the second
method, we leverage a vulnerability in a dependent library
used by the Android version of Threema.

Execution: The attacker’s objective is to forge a vouch
box vouch for this key X that would allow the attacker to
authenticate as the victim in the C2S protocol. Let (u,U) be
the long-term key pair of the victim. Assume that the first
step of the attack has already been executed, meaning that,
whenever the victim wants to send a message to the attacker,
they will use their private key u and the server’s public key S to
encrypt their message. Assume also that the attacker manages
to find a private key x such that the corresponding public key
X = gx has the following form: a 0x01 byte, followed by a
string σ composed of 30 printable UTF-8 characters, followed
by another 0x01 byte. If the victim sends σ as a text message
to the attacker in the E2E protocol (for example, via social
engineering, e.g. sending a special code to win a prize), this
would result in the victim deriving a key K∗ = X25519(u, S)
and encrypting the message. Since σ is sent as a text message,
the ciphertext will include 0x01 as the first byte, followed by
the string σ and then PKCS7 padding at the end. The attacker
hopes to obtain a ciphertext c = EK∗(0x01 ∥ σ ∥ 0x01; n) =
EK∗(X; n) (for some nonce n). This has probability 1/254 of
working, since this is the probability of obtaining 0x01 as a

does not correspond to the server’s public key S.4 This allows
the creation of an account which has the public key of the
server as its own. We created such a Threema account under
the Threema ID “*LYTAAAS”.5

Our second method uses a vulnerability in one of the de-
pendencies that Threema has on the Android version of the
app for creating data backups (described in Section 2.6). The
library used by Threema to create zip files is called Zip4j
[43]. This library possesses a bug where the MAC is not
checked when decrypting the zip file, if certain conditions are
met. This is the case whenever a Threema backup is restored,
meaning that any tampering with the zip would not be de-
tected. In the context of Threema, this allows an attacker that
has write access to the encrypted zip to modify the contacts
file within it, allowing it to overwrite their public key with
the server’s. For example, a user might choose to save their
zip file in shared storage (e.g. a cloud service, or a folder
on a computer which the attacker can access), believing it to
be both encrypted and integrity-protected. While this second
method does not exploit a vulnerability in Threema per se, a
more robust design would have prevented this bug from being
escalated to client impersonation in the C2S protocol.

Impact: This attack yields the same effects as the previ-
ous one. The attacker gains access to messages (still E2E-
encrypted), along with their metadata. This puts the attacker
in a position where they can store messages meant for the
victim and decrypt them at a later point, when the long-term
key of the victim is compromised. The attacker, again, has
the ability to drop arbitrary messages from the conversation.

3.2 Compromised Threema Threat Model

The following attacks assume adversarial server infrastructure.
Attack 5 requires access to the server’s secret cryptographic
material. Attacks 3 and 4 only require being able to “strip
away” the C2S security layer. This is trivial for the Threema
server, but could also be achieved by exploiting C2S protocol
weaknesses, like the one we present in Section 3.1.1.

On forward secrecy: We again stress that, from the point
of view of an attacker located at the Threema server, the E2E-
encrypted communications have no forward secrecy what-
soever, since it is only provided at the client-to-server level
rather than the end-to-end level. This leaves the user com-
pletely vulnerable in the event of a long-term key compro-
mise in the “compromised Threema” threat model. This is
explicitly acknowledged in the Threema whitepaper [30].

In a messaging app, compromising the server should not
give away significant data to the attacker: the server should

4Note that performing this check properly is non-trivial: we also success-
fully registered keys T ̸= S such that T = S · P, where P is a Curve25519
point of order 8. When computing a Diffie-Hellman share using the private
key a and the public key T , due to clamping T a = Pa · Sa = Sa, thus claiming
T is equivalent for our attack to claiming S.

PKCS7 padding. We note that K∗ here is actually equal to K2,
the key that would be derived by the victim during the C2S
protocol and used in creating a vouch box. Because of this,
by construction, the ciphertext c that was created and sent to
the attacker is thus a valid vouch box vouch for X. Since the
attacker knows the corresponding x, the attacker can now use
(x, X) and vouch to authenticate to the Threema server as the
victim. The attack is depicted in Figure 7.

Finding a good X: Creating a suitable key X is feasible,
simply by randomly sampling x and computing X = gx until
X has the desired form. We have empirically estimated the
probability of each trial being successful in finding a good X
as being ≈ 2−51. Thus, after 251 trials, the success probability
would be 0.63. We implemented this approach, using some
batch inversion optimisations to reduce the cost of coordinate
conversions. We found a key of the correct form after 250.0
trials. In total, this required approximately 8100 core-days
across a variety of computational clusters available to us. The
results are shown in Figure 8. We used this key in our experi-
mental environment to demonstrate that the attack works in
practice. We note that this is a one-time cost: once a suitable
key is found, it can be reused to target any user.

Claiming the server’s public key: We now describe two
methods allowing an attacker to claim S as their long-term
public key, the first step in the attack.

Our first method exploits the fact that Threema provides a
paid API, the “Threema Gateway”, for companies to interface
with the Threema messaging system automatically. When
registering a new account, the user is required to provide a
public key. The gateway, however, does not check (1) if the
user has the corresponding private key and (2) that the key

10

merely act as a message router, which cannot read messages
and has no gain in storing the messages that it sees, or tam-
pering with them. Due to the lack of forward secrecy on the
E2E level, this expectation is not met by Threema.

3.2.1 Attack 3 (Message Reordering and Deletion)

The lack of an ordering mechanism in the E2E protocol com-
bined with the lack of authentication of the metadata in that
protocol allows the server to carry out trivial reordering at-
tacks on E2E messages. This means that the server can change
the order in which the messages are delivered to the receiver,
thereby potentially changing the semantics of the conversa-
tion. Furthermore, the server can withhold messages for as
long as it pleases and send them at a later time with an updated
timestamp, in order to evade detection.

In addition to the above, we noticed that incoming mes-
sages are shown in the order in which they are received by
the Threema app, rather than being ordered by timestamp.

3.2.2 Attack 4 (Message Replay and Reflection)

In Section 2.3 we explained how Threema tries to prevent
replay and reflection attacks on the E2E protocol by storing
nonces of both outgoing and incoming messages. Fundamen-
tally, this requires that the nonce database is always kept
updated and is never deleted in the client app. Unfortunately,
this cannot be guaranteed whenever the app is reinstalled
or when the user changes device: in either case6, the nonce
database is reset and a compromised Threema server can re-
play messages that were received by the victim in the past or
reflect messages that the victim has sent.

To make this attack more effective, we note that the
Threema server can easily tell when a victim is likely to have
reset their nonce database, as long as the victim has decided
to use Threema Safe as their backup option. (A reasonable
assumption, since the user is strongly encouraged at registra-
tion time to use it.) Whenever a user restores a backup from
Threema Safe, it will connect to the server with the C2S pro-
tocol shortly after, most likely with the same IP address. Thus,
not only can the server learn the identity associated with a
given backup, but it will also know that, with high probability,
the user’s nonce database has been deleted, making that user
a target for the aforementioned attacks.

To test Attacks 3 and 4, we created a simulated Threema
server in Python to which clients can connect. The server
provides control over the order of the messages and their
inclusion in the conversation, and allows the attacker to save
the messages in order to be later replayed or reflected. We
experimentally verified all the behaviours observed above.

3.2.3 Attack 5 (Kompromat)

This attack provides another example of a dangerous cross-
protocol interaction, in this case between the registration pro-
tocol and the E2E protocol.

Execution: Recall from Section 2.2 that, when a user A reg-
isters to Threema, they must prove ownership of its public key
to the server by use of a challenge-response protocol: the user
combines their private key a with a public key provided by the
server X = gx and encrypts a message m chosen by the server.
When the contact discovery protocol is run (see Appendix A),
the same challenge-response protocol is executed to prevent
an excessive number of queries. The encryption method used
is identical to that in the E2E protocol. In this protocol, the
server does not necessarily have to own the private key x cor-
responding to the provided ephemeral public key, and they
can present the long-term public key of any other Threema
user B instead. Thus, A will be encrypting the challenge with
the same key that they would use to communicate with B in
the E2E protocol. Hence, the resulting ciphertext is a valid
E2E message that can be sent to either A or B (and which
can be made to appear to come from the other party).

Impact: This attacks targets the integrity of the E2E pro-
tocol in Threema. In the unpatched protocol, every time the
contact discovery protocol is run (usually once per day) the
server is able to forge a valid ciphertext. Each ciphertext can
only be sent once per user due to the replay reflection pro-
vided by the nonces. This flaw was already fixed when we
re-discovered it. The app now requires that the message m
provided by the server has a type byte equal to 0xff, which
does not correspond to any valid message type, thus prevent-
ing it from being accepted as a valid message. While this
does effectively prevent the attack, it does not tackle the other
cross-protocol attacks that we present. In Section 4 we discuss
mitigations that offer full protection.

3.3 Compelled Access Threat Model

The following attacks are in the strongest threat model of com-
pelled access, which grants the attacker access to an unlocked
device. These attacks allow the recovery of the long-term key
of the victim. Due to the lack of forward secrecy and post-
compromise security, this irreversibly forfeits all security. For
instance, considering a combined attack setting of compelled
access and a compromised Threema server, we can obtain an
attack that can decrypt all past and future communications.

3.3.1 Attack 6 (Cloning via Threema ID Export)

Assumptions: Access to an unlocked phone, with no
Threema App UI lock.

6Note that on iOS, migrating the app to a new device using Quick Start

would preserve the database.

Execution: Among the backup methods provided, Threema
allows the user to export the Threema ID (as explained in

11

Before being sent to the server for storage, the backup is
compressed and then encrypted. It is well-known that this
combination of processing steps can be vulnerable to attack,
especially if the attacker can control part of the plaintext
before compression [40, 53]. Specifically, the length of the
ciphertext may leak information about how much plaintext
compression has been achieved, and this in turn can leak
information about the degree of overlap between the attacker-
controlled and the unknown parts of the plaintext. In Threema
Safe, the XSalsa20 stream cipher is used for encryption, so a
ciphertext leaks the exact length of the plaintext. Furthermore,
usernames are handled locally in Threema. This means that
if a user U sends a message to victim V , then U’s Threema
ID and chosen nickname are updated in the local contact list
of V on receipt of the message. This happens even if V ’s
app is locked. This provides a means for an attacker to inject
chosen plaintext into the backup of a victim. In this way, the
conditions needed to build a compression-based side-channel
attack are fulfilled. We provide a more detailed description of
the attack in Appendix B.

Proof-of-Concept: We created a custom Threema server
and instrumented the client code in order to redirect requests
to our server rather than the actual Threema Safe server. This
allows us to both see the length of the backups and to make
backups fail by returning an HTTP error code. To automati-
cally induce a new backup, we use Android debugging tools
which can force an app to stop and restart. In order to measure
the number of queries needed to complete the attack at scale,
we also reimplemented the client backup mechanism, and
simulated the attack locally. Figure 9 summarizes our experi-
mental results. We successfully recovered the user’s private
key in 4.7k out of 10k experiments; in these successful runs,
we required a median of 19.4k backup attempts (mean 23.4k).
In our PoC, each attempt requires around 2s, implying a total
running time of around 11 hours for the attack.

The backup is normally transmitted to the server on a TLS
connection, but with modern cipher suites (AES-GCM or
ChaCha20-Poly1305), TLS does not hide the length of its
payloads. So we consider the attack to remain viable even
if the attacker can only see TLS-protected traffic as in our
compelled access threat model.

Impact: Recovering the private key leads to a complete loss
of security: after doing so the attacker can impersonate the
user in any action and decrypt E2E protocol message.

4 Mitigations

We describe the mitigations we proposed to Threema, along
with the ones that Threema employed in practice, and com-
ment on what our attacks mean in practice for Threema users.

Forward Secrecy at the E2E level: We identify the lack of
forward secrecy as one of the main weaknesses of Threema,
since it accentuates the severity of many of our attacks. There

channel oracle queries in our successful key-recovery experi-
ments. Each “query” is a backup attempt by the Threema app.

Section 2.6). However, this method directly exposes the long-
term secret key of the user, and does not by default require any
form of authentication, allowing a compelled access attacker
to backup the private key with a password of their choice and
later decrypt it on their own device.

This is an intentional feature in Threema, but one which we
deem to be a grave security danger: all security in Threema
relies on maintaining the secrecy of long-term private keys,
and this attack allows an adversary to recover such keys by
having access to the phone and app for a few seconds.

Impact: While similar mechanisms are present in other
messengers, their security impacts are much smaller. For in-
stance, Signal allows users to transfer their accounts to a new
device, but it requires physical proximity of the new and the
old devices, and disables the old device permanently after
such a transfer is completed. This is in contrast to Threema,
where a Threema ID export is undetectable on the victim
device after it happened. Such a scenario is particularly im-
pactful in the context of intimate partner violence [27] and due
to the usage of Threema by high-ranking officials [52, 25].

The Threema app does provide some optional locking
mechanisms. For example, the app can be locked with a PIN, a
passphrase or by using biometrics, thus preventing this attack.

3.3.2 Attack 7 (Compression Side-Channel)

While the app locking mechanism does prevent a compelled
access attacker from accessing the user’s data via the user
interface, it does not prevent background processes from being
executed. In particular, the app will attempt to make a new
Threema Safe backup whenever the application is launched if
the last successful backup is more than one day old. Moreover,
incoming messages will be processed and may affect the
contents of the backup. We exploit these facts in our final
attack to recover a victim user’s private key.

Assumptions: Access to an unlocked phone, ability to ob-
serve the network.

Execution: Recall that a Threema Safe backup contains
the private key of the user, and a list of the user’s contacts.

12

is no simple fix: a protocol redesign supporting the use of
ephemeral keys is necessary. We recommend that Threema
adopt the Signal protocol, whose cryptographic API is avail-
able through the libsignal library [44]. The Signal protocol
has received extensive security analysis [28, 14, 41, 15] and
provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security at
the end-to-end layer. We note that Whatsapp has transitioned
towards using the Signal protocol in the past [45], showing
that such a change is feasible even for a messaging app with
a huge user base.

Following the disclosure, Threema released Ibex, an addi-
tional protocol developed independently of our work. Ibex is
layered on top of the E2E protocol, and aims to provide for-
ward secrecy via an asynchronous, ephemeral key exchange.
The keys derived from this exchange are used to instanti-
ate a symmetric ratchet analogous to Signal’s. The lack of
an asymmetric ratchet means that Threema still lacks post-
compromise security. Ibex remains opt-in at the time of writ-
ing. PFS of past conversations remains forsaken.

Strengthening the C2S Protocol: The least invasive modi-
fication to the C2S protocol that directly prevents our attack
of Section 3.1.2 would be to include the server cookie inside
the vouch box. This ensures that, as long as the server picks
a fresh cookie every time the protocol is run, the vouch box
cannot be trivially replayed. We recommend that Threema
replaces its bespoke C2S protocol with the IK protocol of the
Noise Protocol Framework [49], which allows for 0-RTT en-
crypted communications between the client and the server and
provides authentication and forward secrecy. Furthermore, it
prevents the attack of Section 3.1.1 (Impersonation by Ran-
domness Failure). The Noise protocols have been analyzed
and proven secure [22, 23], and Noise protocols have seen
practical deployment in Wireguard [20] and Whatsapp [50].
Threema fixed attacks 1 and 2 via key separation using
an additional KDF step with distinct labels, as well as by
including the server cookie in the vouch box. Caching of
ephemeral keys has been removed on the client and server. We
do not believe these attacks affected Threema users at large,
since we are not aware of practical mechanisms to recover
ephemeral keys for (attack 1), and Threema reported that no
Threema Gateway account was registered with the public key
of their server in the past (attack 2).

Preventing Cross-Protocol Attacks: The attacks in Sec-
tions 3.1.2 (Vouch Box Forgery) and 3.2.3 (Kompromat
Forgery) exploit the fact that the same “X25519-then-Encrypt”
paradigm is used multiple times for different purposes but
with the same keys. By using payloads created in one protocol
in another, the adversary gains capabilities that they would not
have when viewing the protocols separately. A secure applica-
tion should cryptographically compartmentalise its protocols,
taking a very conservative approach when using the same
cryptographic material in different protocols (if doing so at
all). A common way to prevent this class of attack is to use

proper key separation: the X25519 key material will then only
be used to derive context-dependent keys using a KDF with
proper labels. We stress that key material that is used to derive
other keys should not be used itself for other purposes, since
it is important to ensure that leaking one of the keys during
its usage does not affect any other key, i.e. the keys should
remain effectively independent of each other.

In correspondence, Threema indicated that they will make

extended use of KDFs to ensure key separation.

Protecting Metadata: The simplest way to prevent the
attacks of Sections 3.2.2 (Replay and Reflection Attacks) and
3.2.1 (Message Reordering) is to protect the integrity of the
metadata contained in the E2E packet. This can be simply
achieved by including the metadata in the (authenticated but
not encrypted) “additional data” field of the AEAD scheme.
This modification has zero message overhead and supersedes
the usage of the metadata box, eliminating the need for an
additional ciphertext and tag. Protecting the metadata in this
way would prevent an adversary from swapping the source
and destination of the message and thus prevent reflection
attacks. To prevent message reordering attacks, the app could
use a per-recipient counter for the AEAD nonces in the E2E
protocol. This would also allow the recipient to detect lost
or adversarially deleted messages, but would still leave the
problem of how to avoid nonce repetitions when the Threema
app is reinstalled or when the user changes device. We suggest
that the app should re-run the registration protocol in this
event, establishing a fresh key pair (a, A).

Threema’s introduction of Ibex fixes the reordering and
replay attacks. The metadata box is now mandatory. Attacks
3 and 4 have limited implications if the underlying E2E plain-
text is unknown.

Preventing Cloning via Threema ID Export: The ID ex-
port feature should be protected, possibly by requiring the
user to provide a passphrase chosen at registration time, or
at least by enforcing the use of the phone OS’s authentica-
tion mechanisms such as biometrics and pin codes. It is up
to Threema to strike a fair balance between usability and
security, but we would err on the side of the latter.

The client now keeps track of ephemeral keys used in
the C2S protocol and the user is alerted if an extraneous
ephemeral key has been used in a C2S session. Attack 6 is
the most likely to have been exploited in real world. This
attack did not impact Threema users at large, but left at-risk
individuals vulnerable to targeted attacks.

Mitigating the Compression Side-Channel: Threema
should avoid using compression. To avoid an explosion in
server-side storage requirements, a binary serialization format
such as CBOR [13] could be used instead of JSON.

Threema disabled compression in backups. Attack 7 has
serious implications, since observing the size of past Threema
backups provides side channel information on a user’s secret
key, but does require targeting a specific user.

5 Conclusions

Threema is marketed as a secure app, suitable for both indi-
viduals and companies. It is used by government departments
and high-profile politicians. On the other hand, the seven at-
tacks we have presented highlight fundamental weaknesses
in the design of Threema. Indeed, the Threema protocols lack
basic properties that are nowadays considered de rigueur for a
messenger app to be regarded as secure: forward secrecy with
respect to a malicious server, and protection against replay,
reflection, and reordering attacks. We believe that the crypto-
graphy in Threema has design flaws that need to be addressed
in order to meet the security expectations of its users.

Stepping back from the details of our analysis, we believe
that our work presents (at least) three useful lessons for de-
velopers when deploying complex cryptographic protocols.
First, using modern, secure libraries for cryptographic
primitives does not on its own lead to a secure protocol design:
It is possible to misuse libraries such as NaCl and libsignal
when building a more complex protocol and developers must
be wary not to be lulled into a false sense of security. A per-
tinent example is the C2S protocol in Threema, which has
many issues with ephemeral keys. Another recent example
is Bridgefy’s mis-integration of libsignal [6]. In some cases,
it is the API of the libraries themselves that encourages bad
cryptographic practice. For instance, NaCl’s authenticated
encryption routines do not allow for associated data. This was
the reason for the Threema’s bespoke metadata box construc-
tion. To their credit, Threema’s developers did (largely) avoid
“rolling their own crypto” but this advice should be extended
to “don’t roll your own cryptographic protocol”. Of course
this advice is only useful if good alternatives are available. In
the particular case of the C2S protocol, Threema could have
used the Noise IK protocol or TLS.

Second, beware of cross-protocol interactions: A stan-
dalone protocol may appear to be secure, but cross-protocol
interactions can undermine security guarantees, as we have
shown in Threema with the vouch box and Kompromat at-
tacks. So developers should be careful not to introduce such
vulnerabilities. Every message should be cryptographically
bound to its protocol and thereby rejected whenever it is used
in a different protocol. This can be done by strictly following
the key separation principle – use different keys for different
purposes. Notably, a recent analysis of the secure messaging
protocol Matrix also exploited cross-protocol interaction to
violate the confidentiality of messages [5].

Third, proactive, not reactive security: Our inability to find
an attack on a protocol does not imply it is secure: new attacks
could be found at any moment and known attacks only get
stronger over time. Often, software releases follow a design-
release-break-patch process (a reactive approach [48]).This
can be inconvenient for users and may also lead to the need
to maintain backwards compatibility, opening the way to pos-
sible downgrade attacks [39, 12, 1, 9]. Developers should

adopt a proactive approach, where the protocol is formally
analysed during the design stage. Ideally, different forms of
analysis would be carried out, e.g. using symbolic approaches
or by producing computational security proofs. While this
cannot exclude every attack possibility, it can help improve
confidence in the protocol’s security. Furthermore, protocols
should be designed in such a way that this formal analysis can
be more easily carried out. In the present setting, because the
C2S protocol uses its session key directly in the handshake
(to derive the metadata key), it is impossible to prove session
key security, a standard property targeted in security proofs
for key exchange protocols.

None of these lessons is fundamentally new, but given the
results of our analysis of Threema, and the recent works in
the field of secure protocol analysis [5, 6, 7], they apparently
bear repeating.

A Contact Discovery Protocol

If the user gives permission to do so, Threema can run a
protocol to check which of the people in the user’s phone’s
contact list are using Threema. To do so, it must compare the
user’s contact list with the list of all registered Threema users,
while at the same time preserving both the privacy of the user
and the confidentiality of the list of registered Threema users.
Threema does this by hashing all the contacts of the user
and sending the hashes to the Threema server over TLS. The
server will reply with the hashes that correspond to users
that have previously registered with Threema. The hash algo-
rithm is implemented using HMAC-SHA256 with a fixed key.
This is done to “ensure that hashes generated by Threema
are unique and do not match those of any other app” [30].
This is similar to the process used by apps such as Whatsapp,
Telegram and Signal [36]. Such protocols tend to raise pri-
vacy concerns [36] due to the information leaked to the server,
including information about people who might not even be
aware of the app’s existence. Hashing the information is insuf-
ficient, since, for example, phone numbers carry little entropy
and can be brute-forced. This allows the service provider to
build a partial social graph for an entire population. Signal
tries to provide stronger guarantees by implementing their
contact discovery protocol in an Intel SGX enclave [46], min-
imizing the information leak due to memory access patterns,
and using techniques such as Oblivious RAM to minimize
the information leaked to the server [17].

in order, its guess for the next character of the key, and the
currently known characters of the key (initially none, thus
an empty string). If the guess is correct, it should result in a
shorter Threema Safe ciphertext. If the shortest ciphertext was
induced by only one character among all guesses, then the
currently known characters of the key are updated to include
the current guess. Otherwise, two-character guesses can be
attempted. This method effectively tries to guess characters
of the base64 encoding of the private key from the last one to
the first one.

In Fig. 9, we show the number of compression side-channel
oracle queries needed to extract 31 characters of the private
key, over 10,000 experiments; of these attempts 4727 were
successful and 5273 failed to recover key material. Over the
successful experiments, the median number of queries needed
was 19,382 and the mean was 23,382. We remark that “failure”
here means that our automated exploit did not successfully
retrieve the key. If a targeted attack were to be run, one could
manually guide the process. In fact, when a failure happens
it is often because the exploit begins revealing characters of
other parts of the backup, which can be easily spotted as the
exploit is running.

To obtain the required queries, it suffices for an attacker
to forcibly close the app and start it again. This induces the
app into retrying to upload the backup. The forced closure
can be done by either using debugging tools or by simulating
user input on the unlocked phone. Then, in the setting of
a compromised Threema Safe server, it is sufficient for the
server to reply with an HTTP error code. Otherwise, a network
attacker can forcibly close the connection, making the upload
fail. Both of these techniques ensure that a new upload will be
attempted at the next restart. At the pace of one restart every
two seconds, an attacker can recover 31 base64 characters
of the private key in a median time of about 11 hours (in a
successful case).

Not all the bytes of the private key have to be recov-
ered, since algorithms such as the van Oorschot-Wiener algo-
rithm [60] can be used to recover the remaining bits. Indeed,
this creates a trade-off between the number of queries and the
amount of offline work required by the attacker. Since the lat-
ter does not require access to the device, it is convenient to exe-
cute just the sufficient number of queries required to make the
offline attack feasible. For example, the van Oorschot-Wiener
algorithm has time complexity O(2n/2), where n is the bit-size
of the set to be searched, and it is parallelisable. Recovering
31 base64 characters via the compression side channel (as
above), leaves 13 characters to be recovered, equivalent to a
search space of size 278 after base64 decoding. This makes
the offline part of the attack perfectly feasible.

Figure 10: Example of a backup, with the private key redacted.

To prevent abuse of the system, anyone that wants to run the
contact discovery protocol must first obtain a match token by
authenticating to the Threema server. To obtain one, the client
must pass a challenge-response protocol which is essentially
the same as the one done for the registration process, except
for the fact that the nonce is now randomly chosen by the
client, rather than being fixed.

B Compression Side Channel

From a high-level perspective, the attack leverages the fact
that nicknames are handled client-side: when a message is
received, the nickname contained in the metadata is set as
the current nickname of the sender. Since nicknames are con-
tained in the backup, this gives the attacker partial control
of the plaintext in the victim’s backup. The objective of the
attacker is to leverage this partial control in order to force a
backlink to be created from the attacker’s nickname in the
contacts field to the private key in the user field. We depict
an example of a JSON backup, with only the relevant infor-
mation present, in Fig. 10. If the attacker’s nickname and the
private key are sufficiently close together, they will both fall
within the same sliding window of the compression algorithm.
This ensures that there is the possibility of a backlink being
created. In order to increase the chances of a backlink being
created, we include a string called a canary which we know
is already included in the JSON backup, just before the string
that we want to leak. This tricks the compression algorithm
into finding redundancy between the nickname and the private
key, creating the compression side-channel that we need.

For our experiments, we used “privatekey” as a canary
for the beginning of the private key and “=” for the end of
the private key. The equal sign always appears as the last
base64 character of the key due to padding of the private key
during encoding, since the key is 32 bytes long and must be
padded to a multiple of 6 bits. We noticed that both canary
strings were necessary. The reasons for this are opaque to us.
Between the two canary strings, the attacker needs to place,

# Zip4j - A Java library for zip files / streams

## Thank you

for rating Zip4j as the best Java library for zip files [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9324933/what-is-a-good-java-library-to-zip-unzip-files), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5362364/java-library-to-work-with-zip-files), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/166340/recommendations-on-a-free-library-to-be-used-for-zipping-files), [4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18201279/file-compression-library-for-java/18201553)]. It has encouraged me to
bring this project to life again after a gap of several years. I tried to add some of the important features that
were requested over this time, and also made the API much more neater. The newer version (> 2.0.0) now supports streams,
which was understandably, one of the most requested feature. If you have any feedback, bugs to report, feature
requests, etc, please open an issue here on GitHub. I will try to address them as soon as I can. I also monitor the
tag `zip4j` on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zip4j).

## About

Zip4j is the most comprehensive Java library for zip files or streams. As of this writing, it is the only Java library
which has support for zip encryption, apart from several other features. It tries to make handling zip files/streams
a lot more easier. No more clunky boiler plate code with input streams and output streams. As you can see in the usage
section below, working with zip files can now even be a single line of code, compared to [this](https://www.baeldung.com/java-compress-and-uncompress). I mean no offense
to the Java's built-in zip support. In fact, this library depends on Java's built-in zip code and it would have been
significantly more ~~complicated~~ challenging if I had to write compression logic as well. But lets be honest, working with zip
files or streams can be a lot of boiler plate code. The main goal of this library is to provide a simple API for all
usual actions of a zip file or streams by doing the heavy lifting within the library and not have developers worry about
having to deal with streams, etc. Apart from usability, another important goal of this library is to provide support for
as many zip features as possible, which brings me to:

## Features

* Create, Add, Extract, Update, Remove files from a zip file
* Support for streams (ZipInputStream and ZipOutputStream)
* Read/Write password protected zip files and streams
* Support for both AES and zip standard encryption methods
* Support for Zip64 format
* Store (No Compression) and Deflate compression method
* Create or extract files from split zip files (Ex: z01, z02,...zip)
* Support for Unicode file names and comments in zip
* Progress Monitor - for integration into apps and user facing applications

## Background

Zip4j was started by me (Srikanth Reddy Lingala) back in 2008/2009, when I realized the lack of support for majority of zip format
features in Java. And also working with zip files was, as mentioned several times above, a lot of boiler plate code,
having to deal with streams (worse still, it was back in the days when there was no try-with-resources in Java). There
was also no comprehensive library which supports zip features. So, I decided to write one, and approximately after a
year, the first version was out. The response was truly overwhelming, and I got a lot of support right from the next
day of release. It was not put on GitHub as git/GitHub was not as popular as it is now. Code was hosted on my website,
as, guess what, a zip file :). And unfortunately, after a year or two after the initial release, life got busy and I was
not able to support Zip4j as much as I wanted to. But the overwhelming encouragement I got over the years made me start working on Zip4j
once again, and makes me support Zip4j as much as I can.

## Requirements

JDK 7 or later\*

\* Zip4j is written on JDK 8, as some of the features (NIO) that Zip4j supports requires features available only in
JDK 8. However, considering the fact that Zip4j is widely used in Android, and to support older versions of Android,
Zip4j supports JDK 7 as well. In cases where the feature/class from JDK 8 is missing, Zip4j falls back to the features
available in JDK 7. In other words, when running on JDK 7, not all features will be supported.

## Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lingala.zip4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>zip4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Please check the latest version number on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j).

## Usage

### Creating a zip file with single file in it / Adding single file to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile("filename.ext");
```

Or

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile(new File("filename.ext"));
```

### Creating a zip file with multiple files / Adding multiple files to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFiles(Arrays.asList(new File("first_file"), new File("second_file")));
```

### Creating a zip file by adding a folder to it / Adding a folder to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFolder(new File("/users/some_user/folder_to_add"));
```

Since v2.6, it is possible to exclude certain files when adding a folder to zip by using an ExcludeFileFilter

```
ExcludeFileFilter excludeFileFilter = filesToExclude::contains;
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setExcludeFileFilter(excludeFileFilter);
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFolder(new File("/users/some_user/folder_to_add"), zipParameters);
```

### Creating a zip file from stream / Adding a stream to an existing zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").addStream(inputStream, new ZipParameters());
```

Passing in `new ZipParameters()`, as in the above example, will make Zip4j use default zip parameters. Please look at
[ZipParameters](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j/latest/net/lingala/zip4j/model/ZipParameters.html#ZipParameters--) to see the default configuration.

### Creating a zip file of compression method STORE / Adding entries to zip file of compression method STORE

By default Zip4j uses Deflate compression algorithm to compress files. However, if you would like to not use any
compression (called STORE compression), you can do so as shown in the example below:

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.STORE);

new ZipFile("filename.zip").addFile("fileToAdd", zipParameters);
```

You can similarly pass in zip parameters to all the other examples to create a zip file of STORE compression.

### Creating a password protected zip file / Adding files to an existing zip with password protection

##### AES encryption

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setEncryptFiles(true);
zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);
// Below line is optional. AES 256 is used by default. You can override it to use AES 128. AES 192 is supported only for extracting.
zipParameters.setAesKeyStrength(AesKeyStrength.KEY_STRENGTH_256);

List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.addFiles(filesToAdd, zipParameters);
```

##### Zip standard encryption

Instead of AES, replace `zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);` with
`zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.ZIP_STANDARD);`. You can omit the line to set AES key strength. As
the name suggests, this is only applicable for AES encryption.

In all the above examples, you can similarly pass in zip parameters with appropriate password configuration to create
a password protected zip file.

### Creating a split zip file

If you want to split the zip file over several files when the size exceeds a particular limit, you can do so like this:

```
List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip");
zipFile.createSplitZipFile(filesToAdd, new ZipParameters(), true, 10485760); // using 10MB in this example
```

Passing in `new ZipParameters()`, as in the above example, will make Zip4j use default zip parameters. Please look at
[ZipParameters](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.lingala.zip4j/zip4j/latest/net/lingala/zip4j/model/ZipParameters.html#ZipParameters--) to see the default configuration.

Zip file format specifies a minimum of 65536 bytes (64KB) as a minimum length for split files. Zip4j will throw an
exception if anything less than this value is specified.

To create a split zip with password protection, pass in appropriate ZipParameters as shown in the example below:

```
ZipParameters zipParameters = new ZipParameters();
zipParameters.setEncryptFiles(true);
zipParameters.setEncryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.AES);

List<File> filesToAdd = Arrays.asList(
    new File("somefile"),
    new File("someotherfile")
);

ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray());
zipFile.createSplitZipFile(filesToAdd, zipParameters, true, 10485760); // using 10MB in this example
```

### Zip64 format

Zip64 is a zip feature which allows support for zip files when the size of the zip file exceeds the maximum that can be
stored in 4 bytes (i.e., greater than 4,294,967,295 bytes). Traditionally, zip headers have a provision of 4 bytes to store
for file sizes. But with growing file sizes compared to a few decades back, zip file format extended support of file
sizes which extends 4 bytes by adding additional headers which uses 8 bytes for file sizes (compressed and
uncompressed file sizes). This feature is known as Zip64.

Zip4j will automatically make a zip file with Zip64 format and add appropriate headers, when it detects the zip file to be
crossing this file size limit. You do not have to explicitly specify any flag for Zip4j to use this feature.

### Extracting all files from a zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractAll("/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting all files from a password protected zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractAll("/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a single file from zip

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a folder from zip (since v2.6.0)

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").extractFile("folderNameInZip/", "/destination_directory");
```

### Extracting a single file from zip which is password protected

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory");
```

Since v2.6.0: If the file name represents a directory, Zip4j will extract all files in the zip that are part of this directory.

### Extracting a single file from zip and giving it a new file name

Below example will extract the file `fileNameInZip.txt` from the zip file to the output directory `/destination_directory`
and will give the file the name `newfileName.txt`. Without the third parameter of the new file name, the same name as the
file in the zip will be used, which in this case is `fileNameInZip.txt`. If the file being extracted is a directory,
`newFileName` parameter will be used as the directory name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip", "password".toCharArray()).extractFile("fileNameInZip.txt", "/destination_directory", "newfileName.txt");
```

### Get an input stream for an entry in a zip file

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("filename.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("entry_name_in_zip.txt");
InputStream inputStream = zipFile.getInputStream(fileHeader);
```

You can now use this input stream to read content from it/write content to an output stream. Please note that the
entry/file name is relative to the directory it is in. If `entry_name_in_zip.txt` is in a folder called "root\_folder" in
the zip, then you have to use `zipFile.getFileHeader("root_folder/entry_name_in_zip.txt");`.

### Remove a file/entry from a zip file

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").removeFile("fileNameInZipToRemove");
```

If `fileNameInZipToRemove` represents a folder all the files and folders under this folder will be removed as well
(this is valid since v2.5.0 of Zip4j. All prior versions remove just the single entry even if it is a folder).

Please note that the file name is relative the root folder in zip. That is, if the file you want to remove exists in a
folder called "folder1", which in-turn exists in a folder called "root-folder", removing this file from zip has to be done
as below:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").removeFile("root-folder/folder1/fileNameInZipToRemove");
```

If you want to be sure that the file you want to remove exists in zip file or if you don't want to deal with file names
as string when using the `removeFile` API, you can use the other overloaded method which takes in a `FileHeader`:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("someZip.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("fileNameInZipToRemove");

if (fileHeader == null) {
  // file does not exist
}

zipFile.removeFile(fileHeader);
```

Since v2.5.0 of Zip4j, it is possible to remove multiple files and folders from a zip file. You can now pass in a list
as shown in the code below:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("someZip.zip");
List<String> filesToRemove = Arrays.asList("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "some-folder/", "some-new-folder-1/somefile.pdf");

zipFile.removeFiles(filesToRemove);
```

The above code will remove `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, all files and folders under `some-folder` (including `some-folder`)
and just the entry `somefile.pdf` in folder `some-new-folder-1`. All other files and folders are kept intact in the zip
file.

### Rename entries in the zip file

There are three ways to rename an entry in a zip file with Zip4j. One way is to pass in a file header and the new file
name:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("sample.zip");
FileHeader fileHeader = zipFile.getFileHeader("entry-to-be-changed.pdf");
zipFile.renameFile(fileHeader, "new-file-name.pdf");
```

Second way is to pass in just the file name to be changed (instead of the file header), and the new file name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("entry-to-be-changed.pdf", "new-file-name.pdf");
```

It is also possible to change multiple file names at once. In this case you have to use a map, with the key of the entry
in the map being the entry to be changed, and the value of the map being the new file name:

```
Map<String, String> fileNamesMap = new HashMap<>();
fileNamesMap.put("firstFile.txt", "newFileFirst.txt");
fileNamesMap.put("secondFile.pdf", "newSecondFile.pdf");
fileNamesMap.put("some-folder/thirdFile.bin", "some-folder/newThirdFile.bin");
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFiles(fileNamesMap);
```

To modify an entry name which is inside a folder, the new file name should contain the complete parent path as well.
For example, if an entry by the name `some-entry.pdf` is in the folder `some-folder/some-sub-folder/`, to modify this
entry name to `some-new-entry.pdf`:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "some-folder/some-sub-folder/new-entry.pdf");
```

If the parent path is missing, then the file will be put at the root of the zip file. In the below example, after
the file is renamed, `some-new-entry.pdf` will exist at the root of the zip file instead of at `some-folder/some-sub-folder/`:

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "some-new-entry.pdf");
```

This also gives the flexibility to "move" the entry to a different folder. The below example will move the
`some-entry.pdf` from `some-folder/some-sub-folder/` to `folder-to-be-moved-to/sub-folder/` and the file will also be
renamed to `new-entry.pdf`. To just move the file, use the same file name instead of a new file name.

```
new ZipFile("filename.zip").renameFile("some-folder/some-sub-folder/some-entry.pdf", "folder-to-be-moved-to/sub-folder/new-entry.pdf");
```

If the entry being modified is a directory, all entries that are part of that directory will be renamed so that all of
them have the new folder name as parent. In zip format, all entry names under a directory will contain the full name as their file name.
For example if there is an entry by the name `filename.txt` inside a directory `directoryName`, the file name for the entry
will be `directoryName/filename.txt`. And if the name of the directory has now been changed to `newDirectoryName`, the
entry under it will also be changed to `newDirectoryName/filename.txt`, so when the zip file is extracted,
`filename.txt` will be under `newDirectoryName`.

Zip file format does not allow modifying split zip files, and Zip4j will throw an exception if an attempt is made to
rename files in a split zip file.

### Merging split zip files into a single zip

This is the reverse of creating a split zip file, that is, this feature will merge a zip file which is split across
several files into a single zip file:

```
new ZipFile("split_zip_file.zip").mergeSplitFiles(new File("merged_zip_file.zip"));
```

This method will throw an exception if the split zip file (in this case `split_zip_file.zip`) is not a split zip file.

### List all files in a zip

```
List<FileHeader> fileHeaders = new ZipFile("zipfile.zip").getFileHeaders();
fileHeaders.stream().forEach(fileHeader -> System.out.println(fileHeader.getFileName()));
```

You can get all other information from the `FileHeader` object corresponding to each file/entry in the zip.

### Check if a zip file is password protected

```
new ZipFile("encrypted_zip_file.zip").isEncrypted();
```

### Check if a zip file is a split zip file

```
new ZipFile("split_zip_file.zip").isSplitArchive();
```

### Set comment for a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").setComment("Some comment");
```

### Remove comment of a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").setComment("");
```

### Get comment of a zip file

```
new ZipFile("some_zip_file.zip").getComment();
```

### Check if a zip file is valid

Note: This will only check for the validity of the headers and not the validity of each entry in the zip file.

```
new ZipFile("valid_zip_file.zip").isValidZipFile();
```

## Working with streams

### Adding entries with ZipOutputStream

### Extract files with ZipInputStream

```
import net.lingala.zip4j.io.inputstream.ZipInputStream;
import net.lingala.zip4j.model.LocalFileHeader;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class ZipInputStreamExample {

  public void extractWithZipInputStream(File zipFile, char[] password) throws IOException {
    LocalFileHeader localFileHeader;
    int readLen;
    byte[] readBuffer = new byte[4096];

    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(zipFile);
    try (ZipInputStream zipInputStream = new ZipInputStream(inputStream, password)) {
      while ((localFileHeader = zipInputStream.getNextEntry()) != null) {
        File extractedFile = new File(localFileHeader.getFileName());
        try (OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(extractedFile)) {
          while ((readLen = zipInputStream.read(readBuffer)) != -1) {
            outputStream.write(readBuffer, 0, readLen);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Working with Progress Monitor

ProgressMonitor makes it easier for applications (especially user facing) to integrate Zip4j. It is useful to show
progress (example: updating a progress bar, displaying the current action, show file name being worked on, etc.). To use
ProgressMonitor, you have to set `ZipFile.setRunInThread(true)`. This will make any actions being done on the zip file
to run in a background thread. You can then access ProgressMonitor `Zipfile.getProgressMonitor()` and get details of the
current action being done along with the percentage work done, etc. Below is an example:

```
ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(generatedZipFile, PASSWORD);
ProgressMonitor progressMonitor = zipFile.getProgressMonitor();

zipFile.setRunInThread(true);
zipFile.addFolder(new File("/some/folder"));

while (!progressMonitor.getState().equals(ProgressMonitor.State.READY)) {
  System.out.println("Percentage done: " + progressMonitor.getPercentDone());
  System.out.println("Current file: " + progressMonitor.getFileName());
  System.out.println("Current task: " + progressMonitor.getCurrentTask());

  Thread.sleep(100);
}

if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.SUCCESS)) {
  System.out.println("Successfully added folder to zip");
} else if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.ERROR)) {
  System.out.println("Error occurred. Error message: " + progressMonitor.getException().getMessage());
} else if (progressMonitor.getResult().equals(ProgressMonitor.Result.CANCELLED)) {
  System.out.println("Task cancelled");
}
```

Note that in the above example, `addFolder()` will almost immediately return back the control to the caller. The client
code can then perform a loop until the state gets back to "Ready" as shown in the above example.

Similarly, ProgressMonitor can be used with other actions like, `addFiles`, `removeFiles` and `extractFiles`.

## Contribution

It is hard to find as much free time as I used to have when I first started Zip4j back in 2009. I would
highly appreciate any support I can get for this project. You can fork this project, and send me pull requests for
any bug fixes, issues mentioned here or new features. If you need any support in understanding the code or zip specification,
just drop me a mail and I will help you as best as I can. (See FAQ for my email address.)

## FAQ

1. **Why do I have to pass in password as char array and not as a string?**

   [That's why](https://www.baeldung.com/java-storing-passwords)
2. **How can I contact you?**

   srikanth.mailbox@gmail.com
3. **Are unicode file names supported?**

   Yes, unicode file names (UTF-8) are supported as specified by the zip format specification. Zip4j will use UTF-8 file
   name and file comment encoding when creating a zip file. When extracting a zip file, Zip4j will only use UTF-8 encoding,
   only if the appropriate header flag is set as specified by zip file format specification. If this flag is not set,
   Zip4j will use CP437 encoding which only supports extended ASCII characters.
4. **Where can I find zip file format specification?**

   [Here](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)
5. **Why are there so many changes in version 2.x compared to 1.x?**

   Because when version 1.x was written back in 2009, Zip4j was badly in need of a face-lift and code modernization. Also, my
   coding standards have improved over the years (or at least that's what I like to think). Although I am proud of
   the work I did with Zip4j back in 2009, some parts of the code make me feel like hiding my face in shame. One such example
   is the usage of `ArrayList` instead of `List`. API and code should look much neater now. And also, Zip4j now supports
   a minimum of JRE 8, as compared to JRE 5 with 1.x, which obviously will bring some nice features that I can make use of. (For
   example: no more explicitly closing the streams all over the code). If you still feel like something can be improved (and
   I am pretty sure that there are things to be improved), please let me know by opening an issue here or writing to me
   (my email address is in point #2 above).
6. **What are the licensing conditions for older releases of Zip4j?**

   All releases of Zip4j, from version 1.0, are licensed under Apache License 2.0

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Three Lessons from Threema

## Analysis of a Secure Messenger

Threema is a Swiss encrypted messaging application. It has more than 10 million users and more than 7000 on-premise customers. Prominent users of Threema include the Swiss Government and the Swiss Army, as well as the current Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz. Threema has been widely advertised as a secure alternative to other messengers.

In our work, we present seven attacks against the cryptographic protocols used by Threema, in three distinct threat models. All the attacks are accompanied by proof-of-concept implementations that demonstrate their feasibility in practice.

[Read the Paper](files/Threema-PST22.pdf)

# Background

Secure messaging applications have the basic goal of allowing pairs and groups of users to communicate securely. Desirable properties include confidentiality, integrity, origin authentication, and prevention of message reordering, replay, insertion and deletion attacks.

State-of-the-art applications should also offer *forward security* and *post-compromise security*. Roughly speaking, forward security means that data exchanged prior to a compromise remains secure, while post-compromise security means that security can be recovered after an attack has taken place (provided the adversary does not always remain active in the communication exchanges).

All of this should be done in an end-to-end (E2E) secure manner, meaning that only the intended recipients should be able to read and send messages. Achieving E2E security minimises the trust required in the server that is typically used by such applications to store and forward messages.

Even prior to our work, it was known that Threema features neither forward security nor post-compromise security. We show that several of the other desirable security properties also fail to hold. Our work highlights some of the difficulties faced by developers in creating secure messaging systems. In addition, we draw lessons for developers of secure protocols more generally.

# Our results

We uncover seven attacks, across three different threat models:

* **Network Attacker threat model**: The standard attacker for secure network protocols. The adversary has control of the communication channels between parties (including the users and the server).
* **Compromised Server threat model**: A model in which the server has been compromised and is acting maliciously. This is in accordance with the possibility of a security agency or advanced hacking group trying to obtain access to a large and concentrated amount of sensitive data. We expect a messaging application that claims to provide end-to-end security to be able to protect against this kind of attacker.
* **Compelled access threat model**: A model in which the adversary has access to the device of the victim. Security against this kind of attacker is relevant in the case of border searches, when protesters are detained by police forces and searched for incriminating evidence, or in the setting of intimate partner violence. We assume that the attacker has managed to convince the user to unlock their phone. Even in this setting, we expect some degree of security to be achieved.

![](icons/ephkey_compromise.svg)

Attack 1 (Network Attacker)

## Ephemeral Key Compromise Impersonation

Ephemeral keys are used by the Threema clients and server to create fresh keys for usage in Threema's bespoke client-to-server (C2S) protocol. In theory, this should make different sessions independent from each other (i.e. compromising one session should not influence the security of past or future sessions).

In contrast, we show that compromising a single client ephemeral key allows an attacker to impersonate that client to the server **forever**. Furthermore, we uncover improper reuse of ephemeral keys in the C2S protocol both on the client and on the server, with significant security impacts.

Attack 2 (Network Attacker)

## Vouch Box Forgery

The Threema C2S protocol uses a special value called a **vouch box** in order to authenticate the user to the server. The vouch box is created by encrypting the user's ephemeral key with its long-term key (combined with the server's long-term key), binding them together.

By using a cross-protocol interaction between the C2S protocol and Threema's end-to-end (E2E) protocol, we show that the attacker can trick a user into creating a valid vouch box and sending it to the attacker. This allows the attacker to impersonate the client to the server forever.

This attack means that, under some circumstances, a user might compromise his or her own account **by simply sending a message to another user**.

![](icons/vouch_box_forgery.svg)

![](icons/message_reordering_deletion.svg)

Attack 3 (Compromised Server)

## Message Reordering and Deletion

The Threema E2E protocol does not provide any way for a recipient to check the order in which messages were sent, nor for a sender to check whether a message has been delivered. Even though a timestamp is attached to each message, it is **not integrity-protected** and a malicious server can overwrite the timestamp with a fake one. The Threema application simply displays messages to a user in the order in which they were received.

Taken in combination, these features allow a malicious server to forward messages from one user to another in any desired order and to not deliver messages of its choice, all without being detected.

The impact of this attack is that the semantics of the conversation between two users can be altered by an attacker, despite it not being able to read the end-to-end encrypted messages.

Attack 4 (Compromised Server)

## Replay and Reflection Attacks

Threema has an explicit mechanism to prevent replay and reflection attacks, based on remembering which messages were sent and received. Each message has a unique value associated with it, called the **nonce**, which is used as part of the encryption process. If a particular nonce is seen twice, the application simply discards the message.

In terms of performance, this approach requires additional storage to remember the nonces. Furthermore, it creates a problem when transferring an account between devices.

This is an issue on the Android version of the application, since there is no user-friendly way to transfer the nonce database to the new device. When reinstalling the application, the nonce database is also deleted. This makes the user vulnerable to having old messages replayed and reflected against them.

![](icons/kompromat.svg)

Attack 5 (Compromised Server)

## Kompromat Attack

*The following attack was patched in a previous version of the application. We choose to include it as it highlights fundamental weaknesses of the protocol: while the individual issue can be mitigated, a new protocol is required to tackle the problem at its root.*

A malicious server can trick the client into using the same key while talking to the server during the initial registration protocol and while talking to other users in the E2E protocol.

By doing so, the server can fool any user Alice into unwittingly encrypting a message of the server's choosing that can be delivered to a different user Bob. Such a message could contain compromising material ('Kompromat'), e.g. libellous content or a false confession to a crime.

This is a second instance of a cross-protocol attack, this time between the registration protocol and the E2E protocol.

Attack 6 (Compelled Access)

## Cloning via Threema ID Export

Threema provides a mechanism that allows the user to transfer their account to other devices, by copying over the user's long-term private key. The key is encrypted by using a password *chosen on the spot*.

While convenient for users, this opens up the possibility for an attacker to clone the account of a victim user in a matter of a few seconds, assuming that the victim's device is left unlocked. Since the security of the entire application relies on maintaining the secrecy of users' long-term private keys, this feature completely breaks security in the compelled access setting. Furthermore, an astute attacker can mount this attack undetectably, so the victim would have no way to notice that their account has been cloned and that their messages are being read.

![](icons/compression_side_channel.svg)

Attack 7 (Compelled Access)

## Compression Side-Channel

In addition to the key export feature, Threema provides its own cloud-based backup system in the form of Threema Safe. The user chooses a password and a key is derived from it. The user data is *first compressed and then encrypted* using the derived key. The backup includes, among other things, the user's long-term private key and the usernames of the user's contacts.

As showcased in the CRIME attack on TLS, this compress-then-encrypt paradigm is vulnerable to attack if the attacker has partial control of the data being protected. In the context of Threema, an attacker can control their own username, and we show that this is sufficient to make it possible to extract the victim user's long-term key. The attack requires the ability to force many backups to be done. On Android, a new backup attempt is made whenever the application is restarted and the last backup failed; this means that it suffices for an attacker to use the debugging tools to restart the application repeatedly. This enables the extraction of the victim user's private key in a few hours.

# Disclosure and Mitigations

We disclosed our findings to the Threema development team on the 3rd of October 2022, including possible mitigations for the attacks. Soon after, we met with Threema representatives to discuss our work and its public disclosure. On that occasion, we agreed on an initial batch of mitigations to be released in Q4 of 2022, followed by the public disclosure and final mitigations to be released in Q1 of 2023. In December 2022, we agreed on the 9th of January 2023 as the date of public disclosure.

On the 29th of November 2022, Threema released a new protocol, **Ibex**, in order to further mitigate our attacks. The Ibex protocol aims to provide forward security for the E2E layer in Threema. We have not audited this new protocol.

# Lessons Learned

We believe that all of the vulnerabilities we discovered have been mitigated by Threema's recent patches. This means that, at this time, the security issues we found no longer pose any threat to Threema customers, including OnPrem instances that have been kept up-to-date. On the other hand, some of the vulnerabilities we discovered may have been present in Threema for a long time.

There are several broader lessons to take away from our analysis of Threema.

Our work shows that it's not easy to assess the security claims made by developers of applications that rely on bespoke cryptographic protocols. Notably, [previous independent audits of Threema](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/audit-2020-en) did not review the cryptographic core of the application. Such an analysis should be a minimum requirement for any secure messenger, especially one being used in sensitive environments. Ideally, any application using novel cryptographic protocols should come with its own formal security analyses (in the form of security proofs) in order to provide strong security assurances. Such an analysis can help to reduce uncertainty about whether further serious cryptographic vulnerabilities still exist in Threema.

Our analysis also shows that there are some principles well-known in the research community which have not fully made their way into the community of developers using cryptography. We thus draw three lessons, which we think may be useful for such developers:

1. **Using modern, secure libraries for cryptographic primitives does not, on its own, lead to a secure protocol design**: libraries such as NaCl or libsignal can be misused while building more complex protocols and developers must be wary not to be lulled into a false sense of security. While the mantra don't roll your own crypto is now widely known, it should be extended to don't roll your own cryptographic protocol (assuming one already exists that meets the developer's requirements). In the case of Threema, the bespoke C2S protocol could be replaced by TLS.
2. **Beware of cross-protocol interactions**: even if a protocol on its own is considered secure, there is no *a priori* guarantee that it will be secure when composed with other protocols. Cross-protocol interactions can undermine the original security guarantees, as we have shown with the vouch box forgery and Kompromat attacks. Such bad interactions can be prevented by following the *key separation principle* which states that a system should use different keys for different purposes.
3. **Proactive, not reactive security**: our inability to find an attack on a protocol does not imply it is secure. New attacks could be found at any moment and known attacks only get stronger over time if left unaddressed. Often, secure systems and protocols follow a *design-release-break-patch* process (a *reactive* approach). This is inconvenient for users and often requires the maintenance of backwards compatibility. Developers should instead adopt a *proactive* approach, where the system or protocol is formally analyzed during the design stage.

| In the following document (<https://breakingthe3ma.app/files/Threema-PST22.pdf>), there is the following comment:  “In one of our attacks, we leveraged a vulnerability in a library, Zip4j, used by Threema to create backup zip files. We disclosed our findings to the author of Zip4j on 08.10.2022, proposing a 60-day disclosure period. At the time of writing, the author has yet to acknowledge our email."  Can you please comment on [CVE-2023-22899](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2pj2-gchf-wmw7 "CVE-2023-22899") now that this vulnerability has been made public? |

| The last commit (and issue closed) to this repo was September 12, 2022 (as of this writing). I don't think this software is abandonware.  At this point, it would be helpful of [@kennypatterson](https://github.com/kennypatterson) would share details of the reported MAC vulnerability so that maybe someone else could craft up a fix in a PR.  I am quite curious about its implications in other projects that depend on this project. |

| It's an open source project, so it doesn't actually depend on [@srikanth-lingala](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala) to do all the work themselves. A little collaboration might help, here. I'm not really much of a Java guy, but there are millions who are.  At any rate, it looks like commit [597b31a](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/commit/597b31afb473a40e8252de5b5def1876bab198d3) is intended to address this, but without a test case (ideally, provided by [@kennypatterson](https://github.com/kennypatterson) or anyone else with details of the vulnerability), it's hard to prove that it actually fixes the issue. |

If you love group calls on Signal, but don’t want to create a group chat for every combination of your friends or colleagues, you’re in luck. **Today we’re launching call links: Share a link with anyone on Signal and in just a tap or click they can join the call.** No group chat required.

### [Proxy Please: Help People Connect to Signal](/blog/proxy-please/)

[Meredith Whittaker](https://github.com/meredith-signal) on 09 Aug 2024

Several countries have recently blocked Signal, leaving their residents without a trusted and safe place to communicate.

To help in this situation, Signal provides a built-in censorship circumvention feature and also includes support for a simple TLS proxy that can bypass these blocks in many circumstances and let people communicate privately.

![iPhone showing the creation of a Signal username, axolotl.99, on a lightly colored gradient background with floating numbers.](/blog/images/usernames-header.png)

Signal’s mission and sole focus is private communication. For years, Signal has kept your messages private, your profile information (like your name and profile photo) private, your contacts private, and your groups private – among much else. Now we’re taking that one step further, by making your phone number on Signal more private.

Here’s how:

### [Privacy is Priceless, but Signal is Expensive](/blog/signal-is-expensive/)

[Meredith Whittaker](https://github.com/meredith-signal) and [Joshua Lund](https://github.com/jlund) on 16 Nov 2023

![An illustration of a phone screen displaying the Signal interface. Every interface element is represented by photos of currencies from around the world.](/blog/images/signal-is-expensive-header.jpg)

Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to add a layer of [quantum resistance](/blog/pqxdh/) to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work on [metadata protection technologies](/blog/sealed-sender/) that help keep personal details like your [contact list](/blog/building-faster-oram/), [group membership](/blog/signal-private-group-system/), [profile name](/blog/signal-profiles-beta/), and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and [making our code open source](https://github.com/signalapp) and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.

### [New Features Roll Call: Fall 2023](/blog/new-features-fall-2023/)

[nina-signal](https://github.com/nina-signal) on 08 Nov 2023

![A stylized close up checklist with pink checkmarks on a gray background. The truncated text of the checklist reads "Edit me," "Text for," and "Remove."](/blog/images/rollcall-blog.png)

You should be able to communicate without worrying that every gossip tidbit, meme, or joke you share and who you share it with will get churned up into fodder for targeted ads or used to train an AI model. You also shouldn’t have to strip your communications down to the barest and most utilitarian version of relaying information.

This is why Signal is dedicated to providing a truly private messaging app, and why we work to constantly make the experience better for everyone who uses it.

We want you to know about the improvements we’re making in Signal, even the smaller ones that simply make the app nicer to use. So, starting here we’re publishing a periodic New Features Roll Call, reviewing multiple new features and quality of life improvements in one place.

### [Quantum Resistance and the Signal Protocol](/blog/pqxdh/)

[ehrenkret](https://github.com/ehrenkret) on 19 Sep 2023

![An abstract illustration of a Bloch Sphere](/blog/images/pqxdh_header.png)

The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the Signal Protocol was adopted not only by Signal but well beyond. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our [docs](/docs/ "Signal Technical Information") site.

Today we are happy to announce the first step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade to the [X3DH](/docs/specifications/x3dh/ "The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol") specification which we are calling [PQXDH](/docs/specifications/pqxdh/ "The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol"). With this upgrade, we are adding a layer of protection against the threat of a quantum computer being built in the future that is powerful enough to break current encryption standards.

This post is written to introduce this work to non-experts, and will review what quantum computing is and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms, before providing a high level overview of how we are adapting our specifications to answer these challenges. If you would like to skip this summary and explore our PQXDH specification in depth, you can read our technical whitepaper [here](/docs/specifications/pqxdh/ "The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol").

### [Standing firm against threats to private and safe communication](/blog/uk-online-safety-bill/)

[meredith-signal](https://github.com/meredith-signal) on 09 Mar 2023

![The Signal logo centered over a map of the UK in the background](/blog/images/uk-online-safety-bill.png)

Signal exists to provide people everywhere with a tool for real private communication. That’s our only goal, and we take it very seriously. We’re structured as a nonprofit to ensure that market forces can never put profit or expediency over the safety of those who rely on us. Our work also resonates beyond the Signal app. The Signal Protocol has become the foundation for end-to-end encryption technology that is used and trusted by many private messaging services to protect billions of messages every day.

We recognize that privacy is a human right and that free expression and the ability to dissent are fundamental to a safe and vibrant society. But the current state of the Online Safety Bill in the UK puts the future of privacy and expression in grave jeopardy.

### [Signal is for everyone, and everyone is different](/blog/signal-is-for-everyone/)

[nina-signal](https://github.com/nina-signal) on 07 Mar 2023

![An illustration of the earth and the Signal logo](/blog/images/global-header.png)

The tech industry–its products, conceptual frameworks, linguistic conventions, and cultural norms–is largely centered in the US (and, increasingly, China. But we’re focused here on the US, where Signal is based). This is not because the US has better programmers or more visionary entrepreneurs, but due primarily to historical material conditions. For example, early investments in networked computation from the US military, which happened around the same time that the US was becoming a global superpower, which was followed by the privatization and then commercialization of networked computation, then the dot com boom, etc. etc., and here we are.

### [Removing SMS support from Signal Android (soon)](/blog/sms-removal-android/)

[nina-signal](https://github.com/nina-signal) on 12 Oct 2022

For many years, the Signal app on Android has supported sending and receiving plaintext SMS and MMS messages in addition to Signal messages. SMS and MMS are standardized communication protocols that allow mobile devices to send and transmit messages, and most people picking up their phone to text or share memes don’t really think about them.

To give some context, when we started supporting SMS, Signal didn’t exist yet. Our Android app was called TextSecure and the Signal encryption protocol was called Axolotl. Almost a decade has passed since then, and a lot has changed.

### [Help people in Iran reconnect to Signal – a request to our community](/blog/run-a-proxy/)

[meredith-signal](https://github.com/meredith-signal) on 22 Sep 2022

Signal is currently blocked in Iran. To help people in the country access Signal, we are republishing and revising a [post](/blog/help-iran-reconnect/ "Help users in Iran reconnect to Signal") that we originally posted in February, 2021 during a very similar situation in Iran.

If you are willing and able, please follow the instructions below to set up a proxy server that will enable people in Iran to connect to Signal. We are grateful to the community who pitches in to help each other during these moments.

If you are currently running a proxy, you will need to make some updates to ensure it continues to function. Update instructions are [here](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-TLS-Proxy "Simple TLS Proxy").

### [A Message from Signal's New President](/blog/announcing-signal-president/)

[meredith-signal](https://github.com/meredith-signal) on 06 Sep 2022

On September 12 I’ll be stepping into the role of Signal’s President, a new position created in collaboration with Signal’s leadership. I am thrilled, and I can’t think of a more meaningful use of my time, or a greater honor. I’ve been a friend, admirer, and champion of Signal since it was RedPhone and TextSecure, and in 2020 I joined Signal’s Board of Directors, helping inform high-level strategy and direction. So in many ways this is a happy step on a long continuum, not a dramatic change.

Signal is more important now than ever, and I expect this to stay true well into the future. As President I will dedicate myself to helping Signal build a long taproot so it can grow and thrive in dynamic climates. In this role I will be working with Signal’s CEO and leadership, with a particular focus on guiding Signal’s strategy, ensuring our financial sustainability, sharpening and broadening Signal’s public communications, and whatever else is needed to strengthen the app and the org.

### [Technology Deep Dive: Building a Faster ORAM Layer for Enclaves](/blog/building-faster-oram/)

[gconnell](https://github.com/gconnell) on 19 Aug 2022

![Header Image](/blog/images/cdsi-header.png)

Private doesn’t mean lonely. Signal’s mission is to help you connect with people in a secure way. This means that you need to know which of your contacts are also on Signal. This is called “contact discovery” and it’s an essential part of any messaging app.

Most other communications apps enable contact discovery by maintaining their own internal social graph or by uploading and storing your full address book on their servers. But Signal enables you to find and connect with people in a privacy-preserving way. In short, we let you see which of your friends use Signal, but we don’t want to know who your friends are. Letting you know which of your contacts are using Signal while preserving the privacy of your social map requires some complex engineering choices on our end.

In this post, we’ll be diving into some new ways that improve our ability to handle contacts in a private way. That’s right folks. We’re getting technical. We’re talking enclaves and memory access patterns. [If you’ve never heard of an enclave before, don’t worry. We’ll explain it soon.]

Our new method is faster and more efficient. It lays the groundwork for the introduction of usernames and phone number privacy which will offer new privacy controls around your phone number’s visibility on Signal.

People around the world count on Signal for things as simple as sharing moments of celebration like a graduation or as high stakes as coordinating a protest. We’ve got your back no matter what! As we’ve seen in recent times from moments of civil unrest to demonstrations for democracy, people turn to Signal for private and even lifesaving communications.

Day in and day out, the team at Signal is working to keep your chats, voice, and video calls safe and private. It’s our mission. It’s also the reason why, unlike most other tech companies, we are structured as a nonprofit. ​We aren’t driven by profit and don’t make our money from your data or from advertising revenue. As a nonprofit, our whole focus is building safe, secure communication tools for you.

It’s a new year, and I’ve decided it’s a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal.

I have now been working on Signal for almost a decade. It has always been my goal for Signal to grow and sustain beyond my involvement, but four years ago that would still not have been possible. I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn’t ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation.

### [How to build large-scale end-to-end encrypted group video calls](/blog/how-to-build-encrypted-group-calls/)

[peter-signal](https://github.com/peter-signal) on 15 Dec 2021

Signal released [end-to-end encrypted group calls](https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/) a year ago, and since then we’ve scaled from support for 5 participants all the way to 40. There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source [Signal Calling Service](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Calling-Service) to do the job. This post will describe how it works in more detail.

Signal has no data to sell, no advertisers to sell it to, and no shareholders to benefit from such a sale. We’re building a different kind of tech – where your data stays in your hands – but we’re also building a different kind of tech *organization*. One without investors, quarterly earnings calls, or share price considerations. While the model for conventional tech companies incentivizes them to build products for *your data* rather than for *you*, Signal’s nonprofit structure is designed so that the only way value can accrue is in the experience of using the app; the only place it can accrue is in the hands of the people who use it.

### [Improving first impressions on Signal](/blog/keeping-spam-off-signal/)

[jimio](https://github.com/jimio) on 01 Nov 2021

![An unsolicited Signal message appears, offering extended car warranty deals.](/blog/images/spam-car-small.jpg)

The phenomenon of unsolicited and unwanted messaging dates back to the earliest communication platforms: from [prehistoric cave graffiti](https://www.livescience.com/7028-ancient-cave-art-full-teenage-graffiti.html) and postal chain letters to popup ads and robocalls. To prevent spam, most online services rely on large-scale inspection of plaintext conversation content or detailed social-graph analysis to determine who is saying what to whom and whether or not that should be allowed. At Signal, we build on a foundation of privacy and do not have access to that type of data or metadata.

We build Signal in the open, with [publicly available](https://github.com/signalapp) source code for our applications and servers. To keep Signal a free global communication service without spam, we must depart from our totally-open posture and develop *one* piece of the server in private: a system for detecting and disrupting spam campaigns. Unlike encryption protocols, which are designed to be provably secure even if everyone knows how they work, spam detection is an ongoing chore for which there is no concrete resolution and for which transparency is a major disadvantage. If we put this code on the Internet alongside everything else, spammers would just read it and adjust their tactics to gain an advantage in the cat-and-mouse game of keeping spam off the network. The Signal protocols, cryptography, and source code are peer reviewed, shared for independent inspection, and provably private by design. We are bound by these security guarantees, so that your conversations and contacts remain as private and protected as ever, even if we keep spam-fighting tools out of sight.

### [Embrace ephemerality with default disappearing messages](/blog/disappearing-by-default/)

[jimio](https://github.com/jimio) on 10 Aug 2021

![A message fades from conversation with disappearing messages configured.](/blog/images/disappearing-message.png)

As the norms for how people connect have changed, much of the communication that once took place through the medium of coffee shops, bars, and parks now takes place through the medium of digital devices. One side effect of this shift from *analog* to *digital* is the conjoined shift from the *ephemeral* to the *eternal:* words once transiently spoken are now – more often than not – data stored forever.

We’ve designed Signal so that your data always stays in your hands. We think there’s something special about sharing a private fleeting moment between friends, so Signal also supports disappearing messages. Now, we’ve added the ability to preconfigure all conversations you initiate with a default disappearing messages timer.

![You got this ad because you're a newlywed pilates instructor and you're cartoon crazy. This ad used your location to see you're in La Jolla. You're into parenting blogs and thinking about LGBTQ adoption.](/blog/images/ig-pilates.png)

Companies like Facebook aren’t building technology for you, they’re building technology for your data. They collect everything they can from FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp in order to sell visibility into people and their lives.

This isn’t exactly a secret, but the full picture is hazy to most – dimly concealed within complex, opaquely-rendered systems and fine print designed to be scrolled past. The way most of the internet works today would be considered intolerable if translated into comprehensible real world analogs, but it endures because it is invisible.

### [Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app's perspective](/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 21 Apr 2021

Cellebrite makes software to automate physically extracting and indexing data from mobile devices. They exist within the grey – where enterprise branding joins together with the larcenous to be called “digital intelligence.” Their customer list has included authoritarian regimes in Belarus, Russia, Venezuela, and China; death squads in Bangladesh; military juntas in Myanmar; and those seeking to abuse and oppress in Turkey, UAE, and elsewhere. A few months ago, they [announced that they added Signal support to their software](https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-and-clickbait/).

Their products have often been linked to the persecution of imprisoned journalists and activists around the world, but less has been written about what their software *actually does* or how it works. Let’s take a closer look. In particular, their software is often associated with bypassing security, so let’s take some time to examine the security of their own software.

### [Update on beta testing payments in Signal](/blog/update-on-beta-testing-payments/)

[junh3](https://github.com/junh3) on 13 Apr 2021

As the world stands today, the future of transaction privacy does not look great. The existing landscape is dominated by traditional credit companies, who over the past decade have been steadily pushing their networks for increased access to user data. They (and their data customers) are on a track to getting SKU level data of every purchase everyone makes everywhere. There are other contenders, such as regional online payments networks (like Venmo in the US), but the data story there is similar.

This is not a future we are particularly excited about. At Signal, we want to help build a different kind of tech – where software is built for you rather than for your data – so these are trends that we watch warily.

Just over a week ago, [we announced](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1353839763388649473) that Iranian censors had started blocking all Signal traffic in the country. As an interim solution to help people in Iran get connected again, we’ve added support in Signal for a [simple TLS proxy](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-TLS-Proxy) that is easy to set up, can be used to bypass the network block, and will securely route traffic to the Signal service.

This new connection method is supported in the latest Signal Android beta release, and will be rolling out to production users in a few days. Our hope is that this will help many people in Iran start sending and receiving messages again while we continue to explore additional censorship circumvention techniques that will work there.

As more and more of our critical and personal moments move online, we want to continue to provide you with new ways to share and connect privately.

Signal has always benefitted from our engaged and supportive community, and wouldn’t be what it is without your input and feedback. As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.

Software companies typically overflow with data that explains the past and forecasts possible futures. They know exactly who is doing what with their products, how often, and where. While an abundance of data can contribute to their product and user experience decisions, these data collection practices are often rife with overreach and abuse. Signal doesn’t track you, collect your data, or measure which features you use. Anything and everything you do with Signal is your business. Which means that for us to dial in the features and experiences you expect calls for a respectful practice of research.

Whether it’s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or [organizing for change](/blog/blur-tools/), group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal. Today we’re releasing a new version of Signal groups that gives you a richer private group experience with group admins, granular permissions, @mentions and more. If you’re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.

Signal groups are built on top of the new [private group system](/blog/signal-private-group-system/) technology we previewed last year, which gives you a modern group chat experience while keeping your groups private: the Signal service has no access to your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes.

Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don’t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.

Many of the people and groups who are organizing for that change are using Signal to communicate, and we’re working hard to keep up with the increased traffic. We’ve also been working to figure out additional ways we can support everyone in the street right now.

One immediate thing seems clear: 2020 is a pretty good year to cover your face.

![An illustration of asterisks superimposed over the shape of a smartphone.](/blog/images/signal-pins.png)

At Signal, our goal is to build a reliable, secure, and private communication experience that is broadly accessible and simple to use. From the beginning, we’ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours.

### [230, or not 230? That is the EARN IT question.](/blog/earn-it/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 08 Apr 2020

Over the past several weeks, Signal traffic has gone through the roof. New users are signing up at unprecedented rates, and we’ve expanded our server capacity faster than we ever anticipated.

It means a lot to us that so many people are relying on Signal during this difficult time. When users check in on their families, share moments of solace, smile with their friends, or discuss sensitive health issues with their doctors, Signal’s end-to-end encryption and privacy-preserving technology helps keep this information secure.

At a time when more people than ever are benefiting from these protections, the EARN IT bill proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to put them at risk. COVID-19 has us sheltering in place, but we cannot quarantine our concerns.

### [Signal Artist Series: Two new sticker packs from Swoon](/blog/swoon/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 11 Feb 2020

We [announced support for stickers in Signal](https://signal.org/blog/make-privacy-stick/) less than two months ago. Since then, over five thousand sticker packs have been uploaded. Today we are officially adding two more: [Hands](https://signal.art/addstickers/#pack_id=e61fa0867031597467ccc036cc65d403&pack_key=13ae7b1a7407318280e9b38c1261ded38e0e7138b9f964a6ccbb73e40f737a9b) and [Faces](https://signal.art/addstickers/#pack_id=cca32f5b905208b7d0f1e17f23fdc185&pack_key=8bf8e95f7a45bdeafe0c8f5b002ef01ab95b8f1b5baac4019ccd6b6be0b1837a) by [Swoon](https://swoonstudio.org).

When you’re standing next to a friend who says something funny, you can just laugh. You don’t need to pause and say “I found what you just said humorous” or quote their own words back to them before displaying a real-world emoji on your face. This feeling of immediacy and effortless response is what reactions are all about. They’re a quick way to share your take on any message, and you can try them today in the latest Signal beta.

### [Technology Preview for secure value recovery](/blog/secure-value-recovery/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 19 Dec 2019

At Signal, we want to make privacy simple. From the beginning, we’ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours. Technologies like [Signal Protocol](/docs/) secure your messages so that they are never visible by anyone but you and the intended recipients. Technologies like [private contact discovery](/blog/private-contact-discovery/), [private groups](/blog/signal-private-group-system/), and [sealed sender](/blog/sealed-sender/) mean that we don’t have a plaintext record of your contacts, social graph, profile name, location, group memberships, groups titles, group avatars, group attributes, or who is messaging whom. Plaintext databases have never been our style. We don’t want to build a system where you trust us with your data; we want to build a system where you don’t have to.

We’ve been working on new techniques based on secure enclaves and key splitting that are designed to enhance and expand general capabilities for private cloud storage. Our aim is to unlock new possibilities and new functionality within Signal which require cross-platform long-term durable state, while verifiably keeping this state inaccessible to everyone but the user who created it.

### [Make privacy stick](/blog/make-privacy-stick/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 17 Dec 2019

They get slapped on street signs. We wear them on our clothes to identify ourselves to distant coworkers during awkward holiday parties. Some people create massive galleries on their laptops in overlapping levels stacked so deep that the hinges begin to lose their structural integrity and LCD screens struggle to remain upright. The digital versions are even more popular, and we get asked about them a lot.

**Stickers are everywhere, and now they’re in Signal too.** They’re a fun way to add a new layer of expression to your conversations – and just like every other Signal feature, they are also encrypted, private, and secure.

### [Technology Preview: Signal Private Group System](/blog/signal-private-group-system/)

[jimio](https://github.com/jimio) on 09 Dec 2019

Groups are inherently social, and Signal is a social app. Whether you’re planning a surprise party, discussing last night’s book club meeting, exchanging photos with your family, or organizing something important, group messaging has always been a key feature of Signal.

Signal provides *private groups:* the Signal service has no record of your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes. We’ve been working on new private group technology that will enable group administrators and access control, improve group scalability, and set the stage for a much richer group experience – all while maintaining Signal’s unique group security and privacy properties. We’re moving into the future while keeping what we loved about the past.

### [Signal for iPad, and other iOS improvements](/blog/signal-for-ipad/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 27 Nov 2019

![Signal running on an iPad](/blog/images/signal-ios-3.0-on-ipad.jpg)

Signal 3.0 is [now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8):

* iPad support has arrived. Set up your favorite tablet as a linked device.* Forward messages between threads. Editing support lets you amend, extend, append, explain what you intend, or tie up loose ends before you hit send.* Built-in support for video trimming can help any clip turn into a highlight.* Tap on someone’s avatar in a group conversation to quickly message or call them. While the group agonizes over dinner plans, subtly exert your influence by making a case for your favorite restaurant in one-on-one conversations.* Jump between threads and survey your message landscape (in landscape) with a horizontal inbox/conversation view on larger devices.

We would like to thank all of the alpha and beta users who helped us test and stabilize this release. If you want to get an early preview of new Signal features, you can [join the beta community here](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-).

### [I link therefore I am](/blog/i-link-therefore-i-am/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 06 Feb 2019

The latest releases of Signal for Android, Desktop, and iOS are rolling out now with the ability to send optional link previews. This feature is built on the same foundation that has powered Signal’s animated GIF search for more than two years and that we have since [expanded with additional privacy enhancements](/blog/signal-and-giphy-update/).

![Animation that displays a link preview being created on iOS.](/blog/images/link-previews-animation.gif)

We’re launching link previews with initial support for [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). These are four of the most popular sites on the Internet and their heavy focus on visual content makes them a perfect fit for this feature. We don’t believe that privacy is about austerity, and now Signal users can see what’s behind the URL while sharing this content with their friends.

### [Setback in the outback](/blog/setback-in-the-outback/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 13 Dec 2018

Like many others, we have been following the latest developments in Australia related to the “Assistance and Access” bill with a growing sense of frustration. The widespread adoption of strong cryptography and end-to-end encryption has given people around the world the ability to protect their personal information and communicate securely. Life is increasingly lived online, and the everyday actions of billions of people depend on this foundation remaining strong.

Attempting to roll back the clock on security improvements which have massively benefited Australia and the entire global community is a disappointing development.

### [Technology preview: Sealed sender for Signal](/blog/sealed-sender/)

[jlund](https://github.com/jlund) on 29 Oct 2018

In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Signal message, the Signal service is designed to [minimize the data that is retained about Signal users](https://signal.org/bigbrother/). By design, it does not store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list, location, user avatar, user profile name, group memberships, group titles, or group avatars.

We have been [exploring techniques](/blog/private-contact-discovery/) to further reduce the amount of information that is accessible to the service, and the latest beta release includes changes designed to move Signal incrementally closer to the goal of hiding another piece of metadata: who is messaging whom.

### [A letter from Amazon](/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 01 May 2018

Last week, we received the following email from Amazon:

From: [redacted], [redacted] <[redacted]@amazon.com>
 Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms

Moxie,

Yesterday AWS became aware of your GitHub and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Signal plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as “domain fronting”) by using a domain owned by Amazon -- Souq.com. You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose. Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: “You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront”). It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.

We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms. We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.

Thank you,

[redacted]

General Manager, Amazon CloudFront

### [Signal Foundation](/blog/signal-foundation/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 21 Feb 2018

Long before we knew that it would be called Signal, we knew what we wanted it to be. Instead of teaching the rest of the world cryptography, we wanted to see if we could develop cryptography that worked for the rest of the world. At the time, the industry consensus was largely that encryption and cryptography would remain unusable, but we started Signal with the idea that private communication could be simple.

Since then, we’ve made some progress. We’ve built a service used by millions, and software used by billions. The stories that make it back to us and keep us going are the stories of people discovering each other in moments where they found they could speak freely over Signal, of people falling in love over Signal, of people organizing ambitious plans over Signal. When we ask friends who at their workplace is on Signal and they respond “every C-level executive, and the kitchen staff.” When we receive a subpoena for user data and have nothing to send back but a blank sheet of paper. When we catch that glimpse of “Signal blue” on a metro commuter’s phone and smile.

At Signal, we’ve been thinking about [the difficulty of private contact discovery](/blog/contact-discovery/) for a long time. We’ve been working on strategies to improve our current design, and today we’ve [published a new private contact discovery service](https://github.com/signalapp/ContactDiscoveryService/).

Using this service, Signal clients will be able to efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users **without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service**.

We recently [released encrypted video calling as an opt-in beta](/blog/signal-video-calls-beta). We’ve spent the past month collecting feedback and addressing the issues that the Signal community found in order to get it ready for production. Today’s Signal release for Android and iOS enables support for end-to-end encrypted video calls by default, which also greatly enhances the quality of Signal voice calls as well.

We think it’s a big improvement, and hope you will to.

Today’s Signal release for Android and iOS includes beta support for video calls.

This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well. We think it’s a big improvement, but we’re rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it’s enabled for everyone by default.

To help us test on Android and iOS, toggle Signal Settings -> Advanced -> Video calling beta.

Only calls between Signal users who have *both* enabled the video calling beta will use the new calling system.

Signal Protocol is a modern, open source, [strong encryption protocol](/blog/advanced-ratcheting) for asynchronous messaging systems. We use Signal Protocol as the foundation for our own private messaging app, Signal, but also make Signal Protocol libraries available [for other applications to use](/blog/whatsapp-complete).

Our Signal Protocol libraries are open source, licensed GPLv3. We like the GPL for the quality control that it provides. If someone publicly says that they’re using our software, we want to see if they’ve made any modifications, and whether they’re using it correctly. This helps to increase transparency and accountability in deployments of our software, which we feel are important for end-to-end encryption.

### [Reflections: The ecosystem is moving](/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 10 May 2016

*At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for the past four years. We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.*

As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers. Unlike software, when they create something, it is really done — forever. A recorded album can be just the same 20 years later, but software has to change.

Software exists as part of an ecosystem, and **the ecosystem is moving**. The platform changes out from under it, the networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift, and the collective UX language rarely sits still. As more money, time, and focus has gone into the ecosystem, the faster the whole thing has begun to travel.

All of this means that the set of expectations users have for social and communication features are evolving rapidly. Anyone building software today knows that it is not possible to stand still.

At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple. A year ago, we [announced a partnership](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp/) with WhatsApp and committed to integrating the Signal Protocol into their product, moving towards full end-to-end encryption for all of their users by default.

Over the past year, we’ve been progressively rolling out Signal Protocol support for all WhatsApp communication across all WhatsApp clients. This includes chats, group chats, attachments, voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10.

As of today, the integration is [fully complete](https://www.whatsapp.com/security). Users running the most recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other. This includes all the benefits of the Signal Protocol – a modern, open source, forward secure, [strong encryption protocol](https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/) for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.

### [Signal on the outside, Signal on the inside](/blog/signal-inside-and-out/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 30 Mar 2016

A few months ago [we completed](/blog/just-signal) the process of unifying all of our apps across Android, iOS, and the Desktop under the name ‘Signal.’ This simplified the language around our apps and eliminated a lot of confusion. Now we’re doing the same thing “inside” our apps by renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol.

Axolotl has been the name of the cryptographic protocol that our apps use for end-to-end encryption, but it’s not the easiest word to pronounce. Sometimes people use ‘Axolotl’ to refer to just the base [double ratchet](/blog/advanced-ratcheting) instead of the [full](/blog/asynchronous-security/) [messaging](/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/) [protocol](/blog/private-groups/), so there has also been some confusion around what people mean when they say ‘Axolotl.’

To continue eliminating confusion and simplifying everything within the Signal ecosystem, we’re renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol. The implementations have been renamed, so there are open source Signal Protocol libraries available for C, Objective C, Java, and JavaScript in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalapp/), as before. These have been making their way into an increasing number of communication apps, and we’re excited for the future of the Signal Protocol as it continues to spread.

After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance (specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there was no escaping this mantra of “no risk, no reward.” Most of the time, my (trading) style was fairly risk-averse. I knew how to find the signals of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small rewards. Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers and to take the occasional big but calculated risks.

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 06 Mar 2015

It’s 2015, and the end of the road for encrypted SMS/MMS in TextSecure.

The TextSecure story started back in 2009, at the dawn of the smartphone era. Back then, TextSecure focused on securing the transport that everyone coming from feature phones was familiar with: SMS. Today, many things have changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the “TextSecure transport,” which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain committed to supporting *plaintext* SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an *encrypted* transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol.

I recently had the opportunity to listen to another amazing podcast from 99% Invisible, a program about “design, architecture and the 99% invisible activity that shapes our world.” It got me thinking about how my world is shaped by the way I engage with computers. The podcast is a story about a computer scientist named Doug Engelbart who was, in essence, a crazy brilliant genius. He thought of ways to change how we interacted with computers and, most famously, was the inventor of the computer mouse. He also invented a specialized companion device to the mouse that worked like the one-hand equivalent of a keyboard.

Late this afternoon I took a break from working to surf. The sun was setting and a cool breeze was picking up as grey clouds billowed behind the mountains along Hanalei Bay. I had spent most of the day wrangling content, markup, and CSS, and the Pacific was calling. There was still plenty of work to be done, but balance is important, and my mind needed to reset. Surfing would be today’s lesson.

The 1988 film [*They Live*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is one of the last great masterpieces to [come out of the Hollywood left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18qD9hmU9xg). In the film, a drifter named John Nada discovers a box of sunglasses that, when worn, allows the wearer to really *see* the world around him.

For instance, when wearing the glasses, simple advertisements for consumer products are revealed as something other than what they appear.

My ten-year-old mind was completely blown when I realized that I could eavesdrop on the walkie-talkie conversations of the other kids in my neighborhood. I rode my bike to the library in stunned silence, found a book about codes and puzzles, and raced home to my computer. I reluctantly transformed [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) into something other than a conduit for modified games of [NIBBLES.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIBBLES.BAS) and [GORILLA.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GORILLA.BAS), and wrote a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) implementation that worked in both directions.

A few days ago, someone suggested that we go scuba diving and I said “yeah sure, that sounds fun”. Once we actually got to the dive site I realized I had no clue what I signed up for. I was scared out of my fucking mind, squirming against the ocean’s currents, and convinced I would have to go back to shore while everyone else had fun since I was too much of a wuss. It took some time and a fair amount of patience from my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went from frantically holding my instructor’s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own. Instead of feeling disoriented by being underwater, it began to feel natural to swim among tropical fish and sea turtles.

*Winter Break Of Code Day 7*

Yesterday was a day of meetings. Discussion and debate flourished. Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the top of the ridge.

![View from the top of the ridge](/blog/images/lilia-ridge-hike.jpg)

Despite our intense collective focus on conceptual progress, when [Trevor](https://twitter.com/trevp__) agreed to present an overview of elliptic curve cryptography, the entire team, veterans and “li’l Whisperers” alike, fell silent and gathered ‘round the whiteboard.

We learned about fields and curves and groups, of basepoints and cofactors, secrets and signatures. Questions abounded and Trevor delivered the answers, one after another, albeit with enough handwaving that I thought he might lift off and fly himself back to the mainland. However, there was one question that even he could not answer: **Why are they called elliptic curves?**

From Weierstrass to Montgomery to Edwards formats, these geometric objects that form the essential mathematical underpinnings of many modern crypto systems are not defined by ellipses, nor do they resemble ellipses. Not even for very stretchy definitions of an ellipse. There is no immediately obvious connection. So why do we call them that?

As usual, to understand the universe, we must first bake an apple pie from scratch. Or at least pretend to.

> The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. “The world is evil! The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.

– [*Archeology of Violence*](https://www.amazon.com/Archeology-Violence-Semiotext-Foreign-Agents/dp/1584350938), Pierre Clastres

---

At the peak of the Soviet Union’s civic society, more than five-hundred thousand Soviets belonged to a complex, almost ecological system of bureaucracy known as *the Nomenklatura*. Itself a reference to the Roman ‘list of names’ – a codified taxonomy into which people could be organized and signified – the Soviet government was built and constrained through *social proximity*.

The initial idea was to institute a horizontal decision-making system. A methodology that could define and populate thousands of roles for the collaborative administration of social order: ministers of industry, pedagogy, natural resources, foreign relations, internal affairs, communications, and so on.

It was a form of governance intended to gradually flatten a hierarchy that the early industrial revolution had exaggerated. However, over time the mechanics revealed – somewhat conversely – a total institutionalization of ‘nepotism’. Certain senior members of the Nomenklatura had the privilege to appoint new members, and maintain long lists of qualified candidates. New members, now obliged from a favor, formed allegiances to their patrons. Patrons themselves carried social debts to those who appointed *them*, and it went on like this up the stack into the inner circle. The hierarchy didn’t flatten, it sharpened.

Speed ahead to our modern life. My social relations are all but completely virtualized. My list of friends and followers, contacts and matches, profiles and handles … all thrum wildly. Apps are released every week which impose and constrain my lists into new formations, reconstructing my social life over and over. It’s possible to see the reflection of Soviet governance in our own lives today; perhaps there are hundreds of thousands of members (less, probably) of a new bureaucratic class – technocratic knowledge workers, let’s say – who organize and signify civic life in the contemporary age. Building cooperative protocols and APIs and apps and networks. Designing the interfaces and behaviors and experiences of everyone else. Teaching but sometimes refusing to learn, giving generously but sometimes taking without permission, anticipating what we want but often supposing what we want without asking. Designing our dismal fate. Slowly appointing their heirs by proximity.

As a publisher and designer, I count myself among this degenerate few and tread carefully whenever I manage to move or speak at all.

I woke up this morning feeling like this routine was normal, instead of implausible. Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier, I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small victories in the browser extension project, the Signal iOS client, and the Android applications from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure communication tools.

This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a *Winter Break Of Code*. We’ve managed to get access to a large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and we’re inviting people to join us. If you’re interested in spending one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, we’ll take care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.

*Winter Break Of Code* is an opportunity for designers, developers, writers, strategists, and creative thinkers interested in privacy and security to spend some time contributing to privacy-related projects in a retreat-like setting with other co-conspirators. Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and just generally being in Kauai.

Everything that Open Whisper Systems produces is free and Open Source. We’ve been working on apps like [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669), [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms), [RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone), and [Flock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed apps that are both privacy-preserving *and* a joy to use.

We believe that group chat is an important feature for encrypted communications projects, so we wanted to try to summarize some of the existing work in this area, as well as how TextSecure’s group chat protocol functions.

### [The New TextSecure: Privacy Beyond SMS](/blog/the-new-textsecure/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 24 Feb 2014

Today’s [release of TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) is the final step in the transition from a private SMS app to a private asynchronous IM app that does not depend on SMS/MMS.

Using the lessons we’ve learned from the SMS environment over the past four years, we’ve developed an open protocol for asynchronous chat that enables private communication instantly with friends, private groups for real-time collaboration, and the ability to quickly and seamlessly share media privately – all without depending on SMS.

*Winter Break of Code, Day Seven*

![Rhodey surfing](/blog/images/wboc-rhodey-surfn.jpg)

Spring Break of Code 2013 I cut open my foot and hand while surfing; both wounds easily warranted stitches. Winter Break of Code 2014 I banged the top of my foot surfing over some coral; the cuts were sealed within minutes. Spring Break of Code 2013 I struggled with the Android SDK, while Winter Break of Code 2014 I caught myself taking a few too many short-cuts. On day zero nothing is easy, but over time you improve, spilling a little less blood every time.

*Winter Break of Code, Day Six*

A lot of great memories will stay with me after this intense week. The house surrounded by palm trees, people with computers in every corner, laying down on a sofa, chatting on the balcony, and sitting down on the carpet. The surf and hiking breaks on this astonishing Kauai’s landscape, sharp mountains covered by forests falling into beaches of fine sand and fun waves. The nights spiced with Moxie’s tasty cocktails and long deep conversations about the meaning of life, the internet and everything.

## Understanding digital privacy under capitalism

> If commodities could speak, they would say this: our use-value may interest men [sic], but it does not belong to us as objects. What does belong to us as objects, however, is our value. Our own intercourse as commodities proves it. We relate to each other merely as exchange-values.

– Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1*.
### Thus spake the commodity

Marx saw modernity more acutely than most of his contemporaries, and provided a description of capitalism that remains, in my opinion, quite useful.

However, we must be brave enough to attempt to understand his description of the relationship between commodity and value in the context of a world very different from Industrial Revolution-era Europe. That is, one which includes the strange new primordial soup of the internet and capital.

Imagine, as Marx expects of us in the passage above, that an “internet” commodity could speak. What would it say?

We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps & website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. We’ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.

By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the least, and little more than a casual note that I’d be down to reprise my role from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because [@bcrypt](https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt) (who is infinitely more qualified) was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the universe smiled, and here I am.

The [Winter Break of Code](/blog/winter-break-of-code), being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening.

### [The Difficulty Of Private Contact Discovery](/blog/contact-discovery/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 03 Jan 2014

Building a social network is not easy. Social networks have value proportional to their size, so participants aren’t motivated to join new social networks which aren’t already large. It’s a paradox where if people haven’t already joined, people aren’t motivated to join.

The trouble is that while building a social network is hard, most interesting software today is acutely “social.” Even privacy-enhancing technology, which seems anathema to the aesthetic of social networking, is tremendously social. For people to effectively use private communication software like TextSecure, they need to be able to know how to contact their friends using TextSecure.

### [BitHub = Bitcoin + GitHub. An experiment in funding privacy OSS.](/blog/bithub/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 16 Dec 2013

At Open Whisper Systems, we often get emails from people who’d like to donate money to the project. For an OSS project, particularly one that aspires to a collective sense of ownership, handling donations is not always entirely straightforward.

The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a *project*, they’re traditionally sent to a *person*. Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.

It’s never been clear to us how we should handle small donations, so oftentimes when people ask about donating, we just tell them that the best way to help is to use the software, spread the word, and file well-documented bugs when they find them. Which is true! But it’d also be great if we had a nice system for handling donations that matched our objectives for collective ownership.

### [TextSecure, Now With 10 Million More Users](/blog/cyanogen-integration/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 09 Dec 2013

At Open Whisper Systems, we’re working to both advance the state of the art for secure communication and also reduce the friction required for ordinary people to make use of it. We want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication methods that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message.

With these goals in mind, we’ve been working with [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) over the past few months. CyanogenMod is an open source aftermarket Android firmware distribution with [ten million users](http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/) and ~20k installs a day. Their rapid growth is beginning to rival Microsoft for the third-largest smartphone OS distribution.

As of today, the TextSecure protocol will begin shipping as part of the CyanogenMod OS-level SMS provider, in an effort to provide completely transparent end-to-end text message encryption between all of their users.

### [Advanced cryptographic ratcheting](/blog/advanced-ratcheting/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 26 Nov 2013

At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been working on improving our encrypted asynchronous chat protocol for TextSecure. The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of [OTR](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html), with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push. Some of the recent changes we’ve made include [simplifying and improving OTR’s deniability](https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability), as well as creating a [key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports](/blog/asynchronous-security). Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTR’s forward secrecy “ratchet.”

At Open Whisper Systems, we’re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology. Our projects are free, Open Source, and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment. We’ve been working on apps like [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone) (which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving *and* a joy to use.

This winter, we’d like to invite you to join us for “Winter Break Of Code,” a week-long free trip to Kauai for anyone who’d like to spend a week working on this type of easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology in a collaborative environment. We’ve rented a large beachfront house on the north coast of Kauai for everyone to stay in, and we’ll pay for your airfare. While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related privacy project that you propose.

Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic security. These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their outgoing message with that public key.

### [Simplifying OTR deniability.](/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/)

[moxie0](https://github.com/moxie0) on 27 Jul 2013

At Open Whisper Systems we help develop [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms), an encrypted chat application for Android. TextSecure was designed as a general purpose SMS/MMS client which would also automatically encrypt conversations when communicating with other TextSecure users. For those encrypted sessions, TextSecure uses a compact derivative of the well-known [OTR protocol](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/).

We’re currently in the process of transitioning TextSecure to use a device’s data channel as a transport for communication with other TextSecure users whenever possible. This enables communication with the upcoming [TextSecure for iOS](/blog/iphone-rsn), helps users avoid SMS fees, and obscures conversation metadata from telcos.

The transition to a new transport is also a good opportunity for us to evaluate and introduce additional cryptographic protocol changes. Below is one cryptographic protocol change we’re thinking of making that we’d welcome feedback on.

*Spring Break Of Code, Day Six*

Because secure systems aren’t valuable if they’re not used, Whisper Systems has always focused on delivering strong cryptography alongside a great user experience. That’s the reason [call quality](http://www.whispersystems.org/blog/client-side-audio-quality) has always been a priority in RedPhone’s development.

We know that, for many users, RedPhone has consistently delivered a call quality experience comparable to commercial mobile VoIP solutions. But we also hear from users who report problems like dropped calls, distracting levels of echo and latency, or inaudibly low in-call volume. While we investigate these reports and attempt to resolve them, we don’t have a clear view of what situations cause RedPhone’s call quality to degrade, or how to prioritize our development efforts.

![Bare feet in the sand](/blog/images/feet.png)

I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into everyday life. I know the struggles of the world’s unseen and unheard are being subsumed – appropriated – under and into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the [United States](http://www.alecexposed.org/), and (more extremely) abroad ([Finland](http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055), [Greece](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics), … et al.). The Left is no less problematic: reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals of today no other choice but to see themselves as “post-ideological”. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end times – an entire era of Apocalypse – made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.

The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys, and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systems’ Spring Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics, and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists, and humanists. [Lilia](/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/) went over some of the *why*, but practically anyone could see we were concentrating on the *how*, and in the frenzied silence it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.

A guest post by [isislovecruft](https://github.com/isislovecruft) on 25 Mar 2013

*Spring Break Of Code, Day One.*

One of the first times I met up with [Moxie](https://twitter.com/moxie) while travelling, we met at a dive bar in San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.

I had a proposal, the sort of get-rich-quick scheme it seems that only 18th century pirates and lazy hacker-squatters are capable of contriving: We fly to China. Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the Pacific – avoiding the treachery of the South Seas – for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 USD – not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?

RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls. When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe. What we don’t talk about as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.

When we were developing RedPhone, we discovered that the cryptographic aspects of it were relatively straightforward. What we didn’t anticipate was how difficult the mechanics of delivering high-quality, low-latency, and highly available voice communication would be.

This describes the basic strategy we developed for the network side of low-latency and highly available calls.
