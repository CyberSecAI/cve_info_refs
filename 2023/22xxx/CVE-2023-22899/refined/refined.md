However, the prerequisites for this\nvariant are so numerous and difficult to meet that a successful exploit would be extremely unlikely.\nSpecifically, an adversary would need to do **all** of the following:\n\n*   Obtain read and write access to the ZIP data backup created by a user of the Android version of the\n    Threema app.\n*   Know where in the encrypted and compressed contact list backup inside the ZIP file his public key is\n    stored. It could be anywhere in a range of typically several thousand bytes; the adversary needs to\n    guess blindly, must hit the exact byte offset and typically only gets one chance (see below).\n*   Overwrite the location thus found/guessed, XORing in the difference between their own (compressed)\n    public key and the server’s public key (as ZIP encryption uses AES-CTR). The fact that the backup data\n    is compressed further complicates the exploit to the point where the adversary would essentially need to\n    know the entire exact backup contents in advance.\n*   Wait for (or entice) the user to restore their Threema app data from the tampered backup ZIP. If the\n    offset guessed in the second step is wrong, then the exploit will not work.\n*   Convince the targeted user to send a specially crafted “garbage” text message to the adversary’s Threema\n    ID on average about 200 times for the exploit to work with adequate probability.\n",
