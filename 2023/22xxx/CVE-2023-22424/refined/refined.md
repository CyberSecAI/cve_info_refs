Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-22424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free. It occurs when the software processes an abnormal value for the maximum number of columns for the PLC program, leading to access of memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-416:** Use After Free - The software attempts to use memory after it has been released, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploitation may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted project file using the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious project file with an abnormal value for the maximum number of columns for the PLC program.
*   The attacker must convince a user of the vulnerable software to open this specially crafted project file.
*   The attacker needs no special privileges on the system for the exploit to be triggered. User interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects Kostac PLC Programming Software versions 1.6.9.0 and earlier.
* The vendor has released version 1.6.10.0 and later to address this and other vulnerabilities.
* The exploit requires user interaction as a specially crafted project file must be opened by the user for the vulnerability to be triggered.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, indicating a high severity.
