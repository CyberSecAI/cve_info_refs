Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Android app "Wolt Delivery: Food and more" uses a hard-coded API key for an external service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The API key is embedded directly within the application's code, making it vulnerable to extraction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The hard-coded API key can be retrieved through reverse engineering of the application binary.
*   The extracted API key could potentially be misused to access or manipulate the external service.
*   It's noted that application users are not directly affected by this vulnerability. The main impact is on the security of the external service being used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local (L):** An attacker needs to have access to the application's APK file to perform reverse engineering and extract the API key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to obtain the application's APK file.
*   They need the technical ability to perform reverse engineering on the APK file.
*   No specific user interaction or privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in versions 4.27.2 and earlier of the "Wolt Delivery: Food and more" app.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.28.0 by removing the hard-coded API key.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Naoya Kurosawa of BroadBand Security, Inc. to IPA.
*   CVSS v3 score of 4.0 (Low severity)
*   CVSS v2 score of 2.1 (Low severity)

**Summary:** The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded API key in the Wolt delivery app, which can be extracted by reverse-engineering the app's binary. This can allow an attacker to potentially misuse the external service the key is intended for. Although the risk to app users is minimal, it affects the security of the external service.
