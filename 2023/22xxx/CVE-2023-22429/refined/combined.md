November 24, 2024The service wolt is supposed to provide lately has not been provided. I ordered both groceries and lunch with the last bit of money I had. The delivery man went to the wrong building, left the bags without contacting in front of the wrong door. I contacted support so that I could find both orders, another hour went by, the main items in my grocery list were no longer available. By the time the groceries came, the other order for my lunch did not, an hour later they brought it. It took 3 hours.31 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJAthklWbPWWARLZA3ub0t83vZ_dLOIgumVlcPHDCbgAB5j=s32-rw-mo)Ahmed Alzahrani*more\_vert*

July 30, 2024Used this app in many countries without any issues. However,upon using it in Budapest, Wolt picked up the wrong location, which meant that my order was delivered to the wrong house (practically the other side of the city). When I made a complaint, and after going back and forth with customer support, he ended up advising me to enter the address myself (when the app actually suggests that you enable location services for that). Of course, no refund issued or a resolution. Don't use in Budapest!65 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUUNEjjVfrlWrm47gYdvwsboarS27yGFR6A0bCGozy3X9044ifu3w=s32-rw)Hunter Pine*more\_vert*

July 29, 2021This app is amazing. No bugs, no stutters. So incredibly smooth to use. Integrates wonderfully with Google Pay. The order process is intuitive. Everything just works. Congrats to the devs on a spectacular job. The only things is like to see are more restaurant selections, and the ability to customize an item. (No mustard, no mayo, etc). You can only make changes if programmed in, a text box would be nice!111 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews[*flag*Flag as inappropriate](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?p=report_content)
