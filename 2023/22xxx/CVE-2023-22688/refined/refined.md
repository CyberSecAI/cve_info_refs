- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Tabs Slides plugin <= 2.0.3 lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This can lead to unauthorized changes or actions within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is executed by crafting malicious requests that trick the victim's browser into submitting them to the vulnerable website while the victim is authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, only a higher privileged user needs to be logged in. The attacker needs to lure a user into executing the crafted malicious requests.
