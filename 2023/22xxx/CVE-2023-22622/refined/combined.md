[↑ Back to top](#wp--skip-link--target)

WordPress is well-known for its ease of installation. Under most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts now offer [tools (e.g. Fantastico) to automatically install WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/automated-installation/) for you. However, if you wish to install WordPress yourself, the following guide will help.

## [Things to Know Before Installing WordPress](#things-to-know-before-installing-wordpress)

Before you begin the install, there are a few things you need to have and do. Refer the article [Before You Install](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/).

If you need multiple WordPress instances, refer [Installing Multiple WordPress Instances.](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/multiple-instances/)

## [Basic Instructions](#basic-instructions)

Here’s the quick version of the instructions for those who are already comfortable with performing such installations. More [detailed instructions](#detailed-instructions) follow.

1. Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven’t already.
2. Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a [MySQL](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#mysql) (or MariaDB) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.
3. (Optional) Find and rename `wp-config-sample.php` to `wp-config.php`, then edit the file [(see Editing wp-config.php)](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/) and add your database information.

   **Note:** If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional and you can skip it as the install program will create the `wp-config.php` file for you.
4. Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:
   * If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. https://example.com/), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.
   * If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your website (e.g. https://example.com/blog/), create the blog directory on your server and upload the contents of the unzipped WordPress package to the directory via FTP.
   * **Note:** If your FTP client has an option to convert file names to lower case, make sure it’s disabled.
5. Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.

– If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: https://example.com/

– If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: https://example.com/blog/

That’s it! WordPress should now be installed.

## [Detailed instructions](#detailed-instructions)

### [Step 1: Download and Extract](#step-1-download-and-extract)

Download and unzip the WordPress package from [wordpress.org/download/](https://wordpress.org/download/).

* If you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the WordPress package to your computer with a web browser and unzip the package.
* If you will be using FTP, skip to the next step – uploading files is covered later.
* If you have [shell](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#shell) access to your web server, and are comfortable using console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your [web server](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#web-server) using wget (or lynx or another console-based web browser) if you want to avoid [FTPing](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#ftp):
  + wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
  + Then extract the package using:
  + tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz

  The WordPress package will extract into a folder called wordpress in the same directory that you downloaded latest.tar.gz.

### [Step 2: Download and Extract](#detailed-step-2)

If you are using a [hosting provider](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#hosting-provider), you may already have a WordPress database set up for you, or there may be an automated setup solution to do so. Check your hosting provider’s support pages or your control panel for clues about whether or not you’ll need to create one manually.

If you determine that you’ll need to create one manually, follow the instructions for Using phpMyAdmin below to create your WordPress username and database. For other tools such as Plesk, cPanel and Using the MySQL Client, refer the article [Creating Database for WordPress.](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/creating-database/)

If you have only one database and it is already in use, you can install WordPress in it – just make sure to have a distinctive prefix for your tables to avoid over-writing any existing database tables.

#### Using phpMyAdmin

If your web server has [phpMyAdmin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#phpmyadmin) installed, you may follow these instructions to create your WordPress username and database. If you work on your own computer, on most Linux distributions you can install PhpMyAdmin automatically.

***Note:** These instructions are written for phpMyAdmin 4.4; the phpMyAdmin user interface can vary slightly between versions.*

1. If a database relating to WordPress does not already exist in the **Database** dropdown on the left, create one:
   1. Choose a name for your WordPress database: ‘`wordpress`‘ or ‘`blog`‘ are good, but most hosting services (especially shared hosting) will require a name beginning with your username and an underscore, so, even if you work on your own computer, we advise that you check your hosting service requirements so that you can follow them on your own server and be able to transfer your database without modification. Enter the chosen database name in the **Create database** field and choose the best collation for your language and encoding. In most cases it’s better to choose in the “utf8\_” series and, if you don’t find your language, to choose “utf8mb4\_general\_ci” [(Refer this article about upgrading to utf8mb4)](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/02/the-utf8mb4-upgrade/).

      ![Creating a database in phpMyAdmin 4.4](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/phpMyAdmin_create_database_4.4.jpg?ssl=1)
   2. Click the **phpMyAdmin** icon in the upper left to return to the main page, then click the **Users** tab. If a user relating to WordPress does not already exist in the list of users, create one:

      ![Create user in phpMyAdmin 4.4](https://i0.wp.com/codex.wordpress.org/images/2/26/users.jpg?ssl=1)
      1. Click **Add user**.
      2. Choose a username for WordPress (‘`wordpress`‘ is good) and enter it in the **User name** field. (Be sure **Use text field**: is selected from the dropdown.)
      3. Choose a secure password (ideally containing a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols), and enter it in the **Password** field. (Be sure **Use text field**: is selected from the dropdown.) Re-enter the password in the **Re-type** field.
      4. Write down the username and password you chose.
      5. Leave all options under **Global privileges** at their defaults.
      6. Click **Go**.
      7. Return to the Users screen and click the **Edit privileges** icon on the user you’ve just created for WordPress.
      8. In the **Database-specific privileges** section, select the database you’ve just created for WordPress under the **Add privileges to the following database** dropdown, and click Go.
      9. The page will refresh with privileges for that database. Click **Check All** to select all privileges, and click **Go**.
      10. On the resulting page, make note of the host name listed after **Server**: at the top of the page. (This will usually be **localhost**.)

   ![Make sure the server is localhost](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/phpMyAdmin_server_info_4.4.jpg?ssl=1)

### [Step 3: Set up wp-config.php](#detailed-step-3)

You can either create and edit the wp-config.php file yourself, or you can skip this step and let WordPress try to do this itself when you run the installation script (step 5). (you’ll still need to tell WordPress your database information).

(For more extensive details, and step by step instructions for creating the configuration file and your secret key for password security, please see [Editing wp-config.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/)).

Return to where you extracted the WordPress package in Step 1, rename the file wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, and open it in a text editor.

[Enter your database information](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/#configure-database-settings) under the section labeled

```
 // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //

```

**DB\_NAME**

The name of the database you created for WordPress in Step 2.

**DB\_USER**

The username you created for WordPress in Step 2.

**DB\_PASSWORD**

The password you chose for the WordPress username in Step 2.

**DB\_HOST**

The hostname you determined in Step 2 (usually localhost, but not always; see [some possible DB\_HOST values](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/#set-database-host)). If a port, socket, or pipe is necessary, append a colon (:) and then the relevant information to the hostname.

**DB\_CHARSET**

The database character set, normally should not be changed (see [Editing wp-config.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/)).

**DB\_COLLATE**

The database collation should normally be left blank (see [Editing wp-config.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/)).

[Enter your secret key values](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/wp-config/) under the section labeled

```
/* Authentication Unique Keys and Salts. */

```

Save the `wp-config.php` file.

### [Step 4: Upload the files](#step-4-upload-the-files)

Now you will need to decide where on your domain you’d like your WordPress-powered site to appear:

– In the root directory of your website. (For example, https://example.com/)

– In a subdirectory of your website. (For example, https://example.com/blog/)

***Note:** The location of your root web directory in the filesystem on your [web server](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#web-server) will vary across [hosting providers](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#hosting-provider) and operating systems. Check with your hosting provider or system administrator if you do not know where this is.*

#### In the Root Directory

* If you need to upload your files to your web server, use an [FTP](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#ftp) client to upload all the contents of the wordpress directory (but not the directory itself) into the root directory of your website.

  If your files are already on your web server, and you are using [shell](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#shell) access to install WordPress, move all of the contents of the wordpress directory (but not the directory itself) into the root directory of your website.

#### In a Subdirectory

* If you need to upload your files to your web server, rename the wordpress directory to your desired name, then use an [FTP](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#ftp) client to upload the directory to your desired location within the root directory of your website.
* If your files are already on your web server, and you are using [shell](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#shell) access to install WordPress, move the wordpress directory to your desired location within the root directory of your website, and rename the directory to your desired name.

### [Step 5: Run the Install Script](#step-5-run-the-install-script)

Point a web browser to start the installation script.

* If you placed the WordPress files in the root directory, you should visit: https://example.com/wp-admin/install.php
* If you placed the WordPress files in a subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: https://example.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php

#### Setup configuration file

If WordPress can’t find the wp-config.php file, it will tell you and offer to try to create and edit the file itself. (You can also do this directly by loading `wp-admin/setup-config.php` in your web browser.) WordPress will ask you the database details and write them to a new wp-config.php file. If this works, you can go ahead with the installation; otherwise, go back and [create, edit, and upload the wp-config.php file yourself (step 3).](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/#step-3-set-up-wp-config-php)

![The WordPress setup screen](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/install-step3_v47.png?ssl=1)

#### Finishing installation

The following screenshots show how the installation progresses. Notice that in entering the details screen, you enter your site title, your desired user name, your choice of a password (twice), and your e-mail address. Also displayed is a check-box asking if you would like your blog to appear in search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo. Leave the box unchecked if you would like your blog to be visible to everyone, including search engines, and check the box if you want to block search engines, but allow normal visitors. Note all this information can be changed later in your [Administration Screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/).

![The WordPress installation screen](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/install-step5_v47.png?ssl=1)

If you successfully install the WordPress, login prompt will be displayed.

Install script troubleshooting

– If you get an error about the database when you run the install script:

– Go back to [Step 2](#detailed-step-2) and [Step 3](#detailed-step-3), and make sure you entered all the correct database information into wp-config.php.

– Make sure you granted your WordPress user permission to access your WordPress database in **Step 3.**

– Make sure the database server is running.

## [Common installation problems](#common-installation-problems)

The following are some of the most common installation problems. For more information and troubleshooting for problems with your WordPress installation, check out [FAQ Installation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-installation/) and [FAQ Troubleshooting](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-troubleshooting/).

**I see a directory listing rather than a web page.**

The web server needs to be told to view index.php by default. In Apache, use the DirectoryIndex index.php directive. The simplest option is to create a file named .htaccess in the installed directory and place the directive there. Another option is to add the directive to the web server’s configuration files.

**I see lots of `Headers already sent` errors. How do I fix this?**

You probably introduced a syntax error in editing wp-config.php.

1. Download wp-config.php (if you don’t have [shell](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#shell) access).
2. Open it in a [text editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#text-editor).
3. Check that the first line contains nothing but , and that there is no text after it (not even whitespace).
4. If your text editor saves as Unicode, make sure it adds **no byte order mark (BOM)**. Most Unicode-enabled text editors do not inform the user whether or not it adds a BOM to files; if so, try using a different text editor.
5. Save the file, upload it again if necessary, and reload the page in your browser.

**My page comes out gibberish. When I look at the source I see a lot of “`<?php ?>`” tags.**

If the `<?php ?>` tags are being sent to the browser, it means your [PHP](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#php) is not working properly. All PHP code is supposed to be executed before the server sends the resulting [HTML](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/glossary/#html) to your web browser. (That’s why it’s called a preprocessor.) Make sure your web server meets the requirements to run WordPress, that PHP is installed and configured properly, or contact your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.

**I keep getting an `Error connecting to database` message but I’m sure my configuration is correct.**

Try resetting your MySQL password manually. If you have access to MySQL via shell, try issuing:

```
SET PASSWORD FOR 'wordpressusername'@'hostname' = OLD_PASSWORD('password');

```

If you do not have shell access, you should be able to simply enter the above into an SQL query in phpMyAdmin. Failing that, you may need to use your host’s control panel to reset the password for your database user.

**I keep getting an `Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress` message but I’m sure my configuration is correct.**

Check to make sure that your configuration of your web-server is correct and that the MySQL plugin is getting loaded correctly by your web-server program. Sometimes this issue requires everything in the path all the way from the web-server down to the MySQL installation to be checked and verified to be fully operational. Incorrect configuration files or settings are often the cause of this issue.

**My image/MP3 uploads aren’t working.**

If you use the Rich Text Editor on a blog that’s installed in a subdirectory, and drag a newly uploaded image into the editor field, the image may vanish a couple seconds later. This is due to a problem with TinyMCE (the rich text editor) not getting enough information during the drag operation to construct the path to the image or other file correctly. The solution is to NOT drag uploaded images into the editor. Instead, click and hold on the image and select **Send to Editor.**

# Security

We take the security of the WordPress project and the ecosystem seriously. With [over 20 years of history](https://wordpress.org/about/history/) and powering more than 43% of the web, we're committed to ensuring security for all, from solo bloggers to enterprise organizations.

WordPress encourages responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in WordPress core, in plugins and themes available on WordPress.org, or in the wider WordPress ecosystem.

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in WordPress, please keep it confidential and [report it to the WordPress Security Team](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in a WordPress plugin or theme available on WordPress.org, please keep it confidential.

* For plugin vulnerabilities, [report it to the plugin developer and the plugins team](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/).
* For theme vulnerabilities, [report it to the theme developer and the theme review team](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues/).
## Our process

The WordPress project is committed to providing a stable, secure, trusted platform for more than 43% of the web. The [core WordPress software development lifecycle](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/codebase/) includes code review throughout the process, with open-source contributions reviewed by trusted committers.

The WordPress Security Team works to identify and resolve security issues across the WordPress core software, harden the software against threats such as the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), and [provide guidance](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/) across the ecosystem.

In addition to more than 50 trusted experts, including lead developers, security researchers, and key contributors to every component of WordPress, [sponsored members of the Security Team](https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/) dedicate time to identifying and addressing concerns in the software and ecosystem.

To address responsibly-disclosed security vulnerabilities, the Security Team works to develop fixes, create robust test cases, and [release those fixes in bugfix releases](https://wordpress.org/news/category/security/). While only the latest version of WordPress is officially supported, the Security Team also [backports fixes to older versions as a courtesy](https://make.wordpress.org/security/2022/09/07/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/), to ensure older sites receive critical security fixes via auto-updates.

The Security Team also works directly with significant web hosting operators and security ecosystem providers to detect and mitigate threats to WordPress-based sites, including coordinating release rollouts and developing web application firewall (WAF) mitigations.

Learn more about the [WordPress project's security stance in our whitepaper](https://github.com/WordPress/Security-White-Paper/blob/master/WordPressSecurityWhitePaper.pdf?raw=true).

## [What is WP-Cron](#what-is-wp-cron)

WP-Cron is how WordPress handles scheduling time-based tasks in WordPress. Several WordPress core features, such as checking for updates and publishing scheduled post, utilize WP-Cron. The “Cron” part of the name comes from the cron time-based task scheduling system that is available on UNIX systems.

WP-Cron works by checking, on every page load, a list of scheduled tasks to see what needs to be run. Any tasks due to run will be called during that page load.

WP-Cron does not run constantly as the system cron does; it is only triggered on page load.

Scheduling errors could occur if you schedule a task for 2:00PM and no page loads occur until 5:00PM.

## [Why use WP-Cron](#why-use-wp-cron)

* WordPress core and many plugins need a scheduling system to perform time-based tasks. However, many hosting services are shared and do not provide access to the system scheduler.
* Using the WordPress API is a simpler method for setting scheduled tasks than going outside of WordPress to the system scheduler.
* With the system scheduler, if the time passes and the task did not run, it will not be re-attempted. With WP-Cron, all scheduled tasks are put into a queue and will run at the next opportunity (meaning the next page load). So while you can’t be 100% sure *when* your task will run, you can be 100% sure that it will run *eventually*.

#### Description

WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause wp-cron.php execution and the resulting security updates, and the source code describes "the scenario where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner," but neither the installation guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior, or alerts the user about security risks on installations with very few visits.

# Solving Unpredictable WP-Cron Problems, Addressing CVE-2023-22622

### Introduction

This article will introduce concepts about how computers schedule tasks with cron and how WordPress’s cron implementation “WP-Cron” works more like a queue instead of a scheduler. I will share some of the implications queueing instead of scheduling may have, as well as how to remediate the risk for site owners and what WordPress core is doing about this.

It was written in response to [CVE-2023-22622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22622) published by MITRE.

### What is CVE-2023-22622?

This is a Common Vulnerability Enumeration reference number describing a security concern about how tasks get scheduled on WordPress applications. The CVE claims WordPress relies on an unpredictable variable, site visitors, in order to check if there are any tasks to be run. This may lead to important scheduled tasks (such as software updates) running inconsistently or not at all.

This is only an issue for sites that get low-to-no traffic, but there is an easy way to address it for site owners and for WordPress core which I will get into at the end.

### What is a Cron?

The term [cron means “scheduler”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cron) in the software world. You use cron to schedule tasks or “cronjobs” to be performed at specific intervals on the server. The operating system runs a background process or service called “cron” which you can think of as always checking the time and executing any jobs that are scheduled to run at that time. Like efficient public transit, you can expect cron jobs to run on time, every time, short of major catastrophes.

### What is WP-Cron?

WP-Cron is an implementation of a task scheduler for WordPress. Unlike cron, WordPress is a web application, so it can not run background processes itself. The way the WordPress developers worked around this limitation, was to schedule tasks for a future time, and any time the application is running (e.g. when someone visits the website) you have the application check if there are any tasks that have not yet been run but should have been run (e.g. they have a scheduled time in the past) then run them.

### Visualizing WP-Cron

To understand WP-Cron better, it helps to think of WP-Cron as a queue and not a scheduler. A task may not run on time, but it will run the next time WP-Cron checks for it.

Using the train analogy again. Scheduling tasks through WP-Cron is like a light rail or subway, if you miss the train (or if a train is skipped) you just queue up and wait. When the next train arrives it will pick up all of the passengers and proceed. Everybody gets to where they are going, eventually.

This is a clever way to get around the inability to run a persistent background process on the web server. As long as the WordPress website gets at a few visitors per hour, WP-Cron tasks will be performed reasonably “on time”.

Thanks to bots, every public-facing website gets a regular flow of traffic. Although bot traffic is normally unwanted, it is very handy to make sure WP-Cron is regularly running.

### What type of sites could be affected?

If a WordPress site gets low to no traffic, then the WP-Cron queue will never be checked and scheduled tasks would not be performed. This isn’t an issue for a public-facing website, but it could be a concern for a few edge cases, like sites running on private networks, sites running on docker images, sites strictly firewalled, development/staging environments, and sites only accessible on a VPN. Just to name a few, but there may be more.

WordPress applications in these low-to-no traffic environments will not run some important WP-Cron tasks.

### What are some of the important WP-Cron tasks?

WordPress core uses WP-Cron to schedule some highly important tasks. Such as checking for updates in plugins, themes, and WordPress core. WP-Cron also schedules the tasks to perform the updates themselves. Without WP-Cron functioning correctly, sites may miss important security updates.

Plugins may introduce many more important tasks which you may want to ensure are performed on a proper schedule too.

### How to make WP-Cron run on a schedule?

The WordPress documentation team already has your back. They provide easy-to-follow steps for how to use the Mac, Linux, and Windows task schedules to [ensure WP-Cron is running on a schedule.](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/)

### Summary

The way WP-Cron functions as an intermittently processed queue is for all purposes completely safe and functional for any public-facing website.

But this may not be right for every installation.

If you prefer a more predictable schedule or manage sites that have low-to-no traffic, then you should consider using the operating system’s task scheduler instead of the default method. There are performance considerations and benefits to switching to a predictable scheduler from the default behavior as well (but this change is done on the web server, not within the web application.)

### How WordPress mitigates CVE-2023-22622

If I had to explain CVE-2023-22622 in the simplest terms possible, I would say it is a “silent failure” concern. In information security jargon, CVE-2023-22622 describes a [CWE-392](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/392.html) or “Missing Error Report” concern. This can be mitigated by making it clear to the user that a failure or error has happened.

Interactions with technology improve when users receive important warnings when something is malfunctioning. Like a notification when a train or flight is delayed, or a check engine light.

WordPress currently informs users when WP-Cron tasks are failing to run in two ways:

* Site Health checks will report when scheduled events are not performed.

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/scheduled-event-failed.png)

* Notifying users with automatic updates enabled when those tasks are not performed. Including when the last time they were run, and pointing out there may be a problem with WP-Cron

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/auto-update-warning-1024x166.png)

Finally, there is a discussion surrounding improving the communication surrounding WP-Cron errors happening in [WordPress trac ticket #57159](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57159). This may be a good place to have further discussion on the matter. This ticket has been updated with details regarding CVE-2023-22622 concerns based on discussions and knowledge I gained while preparing this post.

### Thank you

I must share my appreciation for the many people who have written about WP-Cron concerns in the past (See references below) as well as share my appreciation with the anonymous MITRE and NIST team members and non-anonymousWordPress.org community members ([johnbillion](https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/), [clorith](https://profiles.wordpress.org/clorith/), and [sebastienserre](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sebastienserre/)) thank you for discussing this matter with me, clarifying points, sharing your knowledge, and for collaborating to work toward a resolution.

One major gripe I have with WordPress is the default wp-cron.php implementation. If you are familiar with how WordPress uses wp-cron.php by default, you may want to skip ahead to the next section of this article.

# What is wp-cron.php & How does it work?

The file wp-cron.php is the portion of WordPress that handles scheduled events within a WordPress site. Anything that has to do with scheduling posts or publications and really anything date/time oriented is governed by the wp-cron.php file.

In order for wp-cron.php to work properly, it needs to be executed frequently, but no more than once per minute. However, the default behavior does not require you to set up a real system level cron job on your server. Instead, it uses a piggyback method on every incoming request. When a request comes into the site, WordPress will generate an additional request from itself to the wp-cron.php file over HTTP(S). That sounds pretty innocuous, right?

# Why is the default wp-cron.php behavior a nightmare?

The default method works perfectly fine on a small site with very few visitors per hour. However, when implemented on a medium or larger site or even a site that is being scanned by bots (which is very common these days), this means you get twice fold whatever traffic you are currently handling. It becomes a rudimentary DDoS attack against yourself. This is because the cron is being executed multiple times a minute using an HTTP request. The HTTP request generates additional overhead by having to generate, negotiate and establish the connection over a network socket. It even impacts the effective capacity of your underlying web server. This solution does not fare well in most situations, and honestly, it should be removed as the default behavior due to its propensity to be abused or turned into an attack vector on a server just from regular traffic.

# Well, what are the alternatives?

The only real alternative and the much better solution is to configure a regular system cronjob that executes the wp-cron.php script directly through PHP every minute. This ensures that any scheduled tasks are indeed executed at their scheduled time. It also should not be done via an HTTP request but a direct execution of PHP to avoid hindering the web server’s capacity or generating additional memory overhead on the network layer.

# How do I disable the default wp-cron.php behavior?

This is pretty universal and simple to do. You need to update your **wp-cronfig.php** file to include the following setting:

```
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

* *You can typically find your* ***wp-config.php*** *file in your site’s* ***public\_html*** *directory.*
* *This new setting should be put in the file just after the DB\_COLLATE database line which looks like the following*

```
define('DB_COLLATE', '');
```
# How do I set up a system cron job?

This is simple in cPanel, assuming your hosting provider has enabled the cron job feature on your account. The [cPanel Cron Jobs Documentation](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/70Docs/Cron%2BJobs) goes into greater details but essentially you do:

1. Login to cPanel for your domain: *yourdomain.tld/*cpanel
2. Input “cron” in the quick search box near the top of the page.
3. Click “Cron Jobs” icon that appears.

* If it does not appear, your account does not have the Cron Jobs feature enabled and you will need to talk to your hosting provider for help setting up the cron or switching to a package that includes the Cron Jobs feature.

1. Pay attention to the Cron Jobs page, it will provide you the exact location of your PHP binary. You will need to copy that path into the command box at the bottom of the page and alter the file being executed by PHP to be your */home/username/public\_html/wp-cron.php* file instead. Using the full path.
2. Select the first entry (“\*”) for each parameter. This will execute the **wp-cron.php** file every minute.
3. Click that add cron button and you’re done.

# Why are you so harsh on this practice, it seems reasonable and easy to fix?

I believe it is up to the software engineers that develop our digital world to impress upon themselves a sense of responsibility for their products. WordPress is ubiquitous these days and with auto installer software, like Softaculous, WordPress gets installed on a very large majority of sites. They are installed with the default behavior enabled, which is essentially an attack vector on any server. Now with the hosting industry being so prevalent in our lives, many people have WordPress sites and do not know about this issue until it cripples their site. The default integration is sorely inadequate and should be removed. Today on one server alone, I found over 500 different installs of WordPress and watched as a bot hit each site on the server. Every one of those sites suddenly became a liability for the server’s stability.

I realize that this problem is handled on a case by case basis. However, with so many installs around the world, it would be better addressed by WordPress rather than every single hosting provider who has to set up special conditions on their server to protect against the hole this software generates. The cost of removing this behavior and forcing site owners to generate a system cron should be baseline and a notice placed within the WordPress admin interface that scheduled tasks will not be executed until a system cron job is created properly. This is within my programming skills, so I know it’s well within theirs.

WordPress aims for ease of use, so their target consumers are those that typically know little about hosting caveats. I believe the responsibility here lies entirely with WordPress to fix and they have taken the stance against it. In the meantime, the System Admins in the hosting industry have to suffer through this terrible “feature” when examining servers that have fallen out of control due to a bot running over a default WordPress install.

# Visualize The Insanity

Each visitor in the default wp-cron.php setup spawns a secondary connection originating from the server over a network socket to wp-cron.php. Ergo each visitor in this setup reduces the overall available network sockets by half and increases the load contribution of a single visitor to double that of a single visit. The solution is running wp-cron.php through PHP via a regularly scheduled system cronjob. This eliminates the problem entirely and, in my opinion, should be the default implementation to prevent abuse of derelict default WordPress installations.

# WordPress Cron Enabled

###### medium Web App Scanning Plugin ID 113449

Language:

English[日本語](https://jp.tenable.com/plugins/was/113449)[简体中文](https://www.tenablecloud.cn/plugins/was/113449)[繁體中文](https://zh-tw.tenable.com/plugins/was/113449)[English](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/was/113449)
#### Synopsis

WordPress Cron Enabled
#### Description

The wp-cron.php file is responsible for scheduled events in a WordPress website. By default, when a request is made, WordPress will generate an additional request from it to the wp-cron.php file. By generating a large number of requests to the website, it is therefore possible to make the site perform a DoS attack on itself.
#### Solution

Add the variable DISABLE\_WP\_CRON to true in the file wp-config.php and restrict access to the file wp-cron.php.

### Description

Hello,

Do you think it should be possible to have a list of scheduled events in the Site Health report ?

Having this information may help to debug some "strange" behaviour.

Thank you

* **Type**
  changed from *defect (bug)* to *enhancement*

Bear in mind that if the site is having problems with cron events, this list can potentially contain thousands of cron event entries. This is why plugins such as WP Crontrol and Advanced Cron Manager use pagination on the cron event listing screens.

What sort of "strange" behaviour relating to cron do you think could be surfaced in site health?

Hello @johnbillion,

You're right, and I'm currently using WP Crontrol when needed.

I'm working on a plugin helpdesk and sometimes customers tells us that URLs randomly gone to 404 errors, and they need to refresh permalink.

The random action makes me think something maybe in scheduled action is doing something wrong.

That's why I was wondering if something could be done, thanks to the great site health feature.

Hello johnbillion and sebastionserre.

I found this ticket when investigating a WP-Cron concern cited by CVE-2023-22622 and believe there is one solution for both this CVE and the problem you are concerned about sebastienserre. If WP-Crons are broken, or not running on a timely schedule it can cause hard to track issues or other problems in the Application.

One of the more serious examples would be the auto-update functionality, which relies on WP-Cron to complete.

CVE-2023-22622 describes a concern that if WP-Cron is failing or running sporadically, users should be made aware (so they can take action) instead of silently failing. To address this, WordPress can add a notification if WP-Cron tasks can be detected as not running.

Would it solve your concerns sebastienserre? If wp-admin had a notification that WP-Cron tasks were running off schedule, or not at all? This is different than your original request, but may fulfill it just the same. As johnbillion mentioned, there are plugins available for improved management of WP-Cron tasks.

---

The detection of WP-Cron issues can be done using WP-Cron itself, creating a WP-cron "heartbeat" task that logs it's last run time and alerts the administrator if it identifies the WP-Cron task itself runs too infrequently.

This will detect WP-Cron runs intermittently, but since it relies on WP-Cron it will not function if WP-Cron is disabled.

There needs to be at least one mechanism outside of WP-Cron that checks the WP-Cron queue for issues such as scheduling delays. If this mechanism is part of wp-admin, perhaps displayed in the dashboard (to be more prominent that site health) it would alert users WP-Cron is failing to run and direct them to proper support documentation. (This support documentation may need to be found or written)

---

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas for this matter. Thank you.

Hello @rawrly,

My initial goals was to add in the site health any info about a missing schedule because it can help to debug or to find a start of debug.

In case of Cron, we could see that a task has been missed and then use different available tool to solve it.

Regards

### [#5](#comment:5) in reply to: [↑ 4](#comment:4) [@rawrly](https://profiles.wordpress.org/rawrly) [2 years](/timeline?from=2023-01-31T17%3A18%3A07Z&precision=second "See timeline at 01/31/2023 05:18:07 PM") ago

I did a little digging, discussion (pinging @Clorith to bring him into the conversation), and testing. It appears there is a notification within Site Health that informs users when scheduled tasks fail to run.

[​https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-site-health.php#L1787](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-site-health.php#L1787)

I tested this on my site and confirmed it works as expected, warning me that a "scheduled event has failed" with the name of the most recent WP-Cron task that failed to run. Would it help your concern if this warning are made more prominent or changed?

I have the following ideas that may help:

1. The site health warning for failed to run scheduled tasks should make clear it is related to WP-Cron tasks, with a link to appropriate documentation to help the user address the problem. (documentation will needed to be written for this)
2. The site health warning currently only lists the most recent failed task, it would be helpful to provide a number of failed tasks (WP-Crons) or provide an expandable list of failed tasks.
3. It is true that not all WP-Cron tasks are equally important, some tasks failing to run (such as auto-updates or tasks introduced by plugins) shold be marked as "critical issues" instead of "recommended improvements". (someone would need to make a list of security related Wp-Cron default task names, and allow plugin devleopers to add their own task names to this list)

Is this in line with your goals?

Yes @rawrly, it would be very useful
