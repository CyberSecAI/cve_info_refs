{
  "CVE-2023-22622": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "WordPress relies on unpredictable client visits to trigger the execution of wp-cron.php, which is responsible for running scheduled tasks such as security updates. If a site does not receive enough traffic, scheduled tasks may not run.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unreliable task scheduling mechanism",
        "Lack of user awareness about the default behavior and potential security risks.",
        "Missing error report when WP-Cron fails",
         "Default configuration allows potential for self-induced denial of service through excessive wp-cron.php requests"
      ],
      "impact": "Failure to perform scheduled tasks, such as security updates, potentially leading to vulnerabilities; Inconsistent execution of scheduled tasks; Denial-of-service (DoS) on the server from excessive wp-cron.php requests.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Lack of website traffic, making the wp-cron.php script not execute."
         ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed, the vulnerability is due to how WordPress's cron system works by default. An attacker could also deliberately try to trigger wp-cron.php many times to cause a DoS."
