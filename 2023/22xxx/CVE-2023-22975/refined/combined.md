| Summary There is XSS vulnerability below! The reason for the vulnerability is that there is no filter on user input. According to the guidelines of CMS, We can create a user, and we can control the user's account number, password and email and so on..... Exploition After, There are many ways to trigger the vulnerability! The one is that we can make a comment and wait other users to click the user created by ourselves. The another one can get admin's secrect util admin login.  OK! We will create a user at first.
