# Remote Code Execution via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in org.xwiki.contrib:application-ckeditor-ui

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-6mjp-2rm6-9g85
Jan 4, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.contrib:application-ckeditor-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.64.3

## Patched versions

1.64.3

## Description

### Impact

The `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki.

The attack can be demonstrated by accessing the URL `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello+from+Groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D` where `<server>` is the URL of the XWiki installation as a user with programming rights. If this displays the text "Hello from Groovy!", the installation is vulnerable.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

Open <server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello+from+Groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D where <server> is the URL of your XWiki installation as a user with programming rights.

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed because no CSRF token was supplied.

**Actual result:**

The text "Hello from Groovy!" is displayed.

This demonstrates that a simple get request without CSRF token can trigger remote code execution. This means if an attacker manages to get a user with programming rights to do one of the following he/she can execute arbitrary Groovy/Python/... code:

* Trick the victim to click on a link with the attack code.
* Trick the victim to visit a website that includes the URL as the source of an image. In modern browsers, this needs to be on the same domain as otherwise cookies aren't sent, it could be in the wiki (e.g., in a comment).

The affects version is the version I've reproduced this with, I think this should be reproducible in all versions of the CKEditor integration as I couldn't see anything that would prevent the attack.
