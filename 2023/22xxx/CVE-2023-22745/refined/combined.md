# Buffer Overlow in TSS2\_RC\_Decode

Low

[williamcroberts](/williamcroberts)
published
GHSA-4j3v-fh23-vx67
Jan 19, 2023

## Package

tpm2-tss
(Linux Distros)

## Affected versions

<= 4.0.0

## Patched versions

TBD

## Description

### Report

Reported by fergus-dall: <https://github.com/fergus-dall>

`Tss2_RC_SetHandler` and `Tss2_RC_Decode` both index into `layer_handler` with an 8 bit layer number, but the array only has `TPM2_ERROR_TSS2_RC_LAYER_COUNT` entries, so trying to add a handler for higher-numbered layers or decode a response code with such a layer number reads/writes past the end of the buffer. For example, on my system this program segfaults:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tss2/tss2_rc.h"

int main() {
    printf("%s\n", Tss2_RC_Decode(0xffffffff));
}

```
### Impact

Buffer overrun, could result in arbitrary code execution. An example attack would be a MiTM bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFF for the RC.

### Patches

in progress.

### Workarounds

No

### References

No

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22745

tss2\_rc: ensure layer number is in bounds

```
The layer handler array was defined as 255, the max number of uint8,
which is the size of the layer field, however valid values are 0-255
allowing for 256 possibilities and thus the array was off by one and
needed to be sized to 256 entries. Update the size and add tests.

Note: previous implementations incorrectly dropped bits on unknown error
output, ie TSS2_RC of 0xFFFFFF should yeild a string of 255:0xFFFFFF,
but earlier implementations returned 255:0xFFFF, dropping the middle
bits, this patch fixes that.

Fixes: CVE-2023-22745
