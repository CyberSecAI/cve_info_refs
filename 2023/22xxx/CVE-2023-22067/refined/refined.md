    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Certain Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow unauthenticated attackers with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE. Refer to âOracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2023â for specific version details. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE or unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data.",
