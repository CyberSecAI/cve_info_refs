- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from Zephyr instances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The system fails to properly restrict access to files, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unauthenticated user can read sensitive files from the Zephyr Enterprise system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Zephyr Enterprise instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs network access to the Zephyr Enterprise instance. No authentication is required.
