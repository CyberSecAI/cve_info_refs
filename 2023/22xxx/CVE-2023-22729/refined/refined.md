  "summary": "CVE-2023-22729 is an open redirect vulnerability affecting the Silverstripe framework, specifically on the CMSSecurity relogin screen. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked, redirect users to third-party websites. The root cause lies in the insufficient validation of the 'backURL' parameter. This allows for network-based attacks where attackers trick legitimate content authors into following a malicious link. The vulnerability is present in versions <=4.12.4 of the Silverstripe framework and is fixed in 4.12.5 and above. The severity is considered moderate, with a CVSS score of 4.3 (or 6.1 with scope change)."
