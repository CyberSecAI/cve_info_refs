Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control to inventory files. Specifically, if anonymous access to the FAQ is enabled in GLPI, these inventory files become accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control (CWE-284):** The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive inventory files, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Inventory Files:**  Unauthenticated users can access inventory files, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information. The confidentiality of the data is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable GLPI instance.
- **Anonymous access to FAQ enabled**: This needs to be enabled.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to version 10.0.6 or disabling the native inventory and deleting files from server.
