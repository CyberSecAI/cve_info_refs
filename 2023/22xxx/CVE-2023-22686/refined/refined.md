- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is CSRF, where an attacker crafts a malicious request that a legitimate user unknowingly executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to execute the malicious request. No authentication is needed for the attacker.
