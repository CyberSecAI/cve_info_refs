- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `bridge_group` function in `libzebra.so.0.0.0` uses the interface name provided by the user in the `interface <interface_name>` command to construct a string that is passed to the `system()` function, without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection in the `bridge_group` function due to the lack of sanitization of the user-controlled interface name before passing it to the `system()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the router. In the provided example, the attacker forces a device reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must first authenticate via telnet or ssh to gain access to the router's CLI. Then, the attacker must enter the configuration mode using the command `configure terminal`, enter the interface configuration using `interface <interface_name>`, where `<interface_name>` is the malicious payload. Finally, the attacker triggers the vulnerability with `bridge-group <1-10>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to authenticate to the router's CLI via telnet or ssh with administrator privileges.
