> ### An Important Message from Bala Sathiamurthy, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
>
> As part of our continuous security assessment processes, we have discovered that Confluence Data Center and Server customers are vulnerable to significant data loss if exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. There are no reports of active exploitation at this time; customers **must take immediate action** to protect their instances. Please read the Critical Security Advisory below for instructions and vulnerability details.
>
> Protecting customers' instances is our top priority, and our prompt response demonstrates our dedication to ensuring the safety of our customers and your data. Atlassian is always reviewing security measures to reduce security risks and support our customers in taking timely action. Customers can expect to receive high-priority patches outside of our monthly advisory schedule as necessary. We believe that taking proactive action is the best approach and we appreciate your ongoing partnership.

All versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are affected by this vulnerability. This Improper Authorization vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create a Confluence instance administrator account. Using this account, an attacker can then perform all administrative actions that are available to Confluence instance administrator leading to a full loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server versions as listed below are at critical risk and require immediate attention. See ‘What You Need to Do’ for detailed instructions.

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an atlassian.net domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical (**10** with the following vector **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)**per our internal assessment.
This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Affected Versions

This Improper Authorization vulnerability affects all versions prior to the listed fix versions of Confluence Data Center and Server. Atlassian recommends patching to the fixed LTS version or later.

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | All versions are affected |

## What You Need To Do

### **Immediately patch to a fixed version**

Atlassian recommends that you patch each of your affected installations to one of the listed fixed versions (or the latest version) below.

| Product | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 7.19.16 * 8.3.4 * 8.4.4 * 8.5.3 * 8.6.1 |

### **Apply temporary mitigations if unable to patch**

1. **Back up your instance.** (Instructions: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/production-backup-strategy-38797389.html>)
2. **Remove your instance from the internet until you can patch, if possible.** Instances accessible to the public internet, including those with user authentication, should be restricted from external network access until you can patch.
3. **If you cannot restrict external network access or patch**, apply the following interim measures to mitigate known attack vectors by blocking access on the following endpoints on Confluence instances:
   1. `/json/setup-restore.action`
   2. `/json/setup-restore-local.action`
   3. `/json/setup-restore-progress.action`

This is possible at the network layer or by making the following changes to Confluence configuration files.

1. On each node, modify `/<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml` and add the following block of code (just before the `</web-app>` tag at the end of the file):

```
<security-constraint>
		<web-resource-collection>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>
			<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>
		</web-resource-collection>
	<auth-constraint />
</security-constraint>
```

2. Restart Confluence.

Note: These mitigation actions are limited and not a replacement for patching your instance; you must patch as soon as possible

### **Threat detection**

Atlassian cannot confirm if your instances have been affected by this vulnerability. You should engage your local security team to check all affected Confluence instances for evidence of compromise.

Evidence of compromise may include:

* loss of login access to the instance
* requests to `/json/setup-restore*` in network access logs
* installed unknown plugins
  + *we've observed reports of a malicious plugin named **web.shell.Plugin***
* encrypted files or corrupted data
* unexpected members of the`confluence-administrators`group
* unexpected newly created user accounts

If any evidence is found, you should assume that your instance has been compromised and follow your security incident response plan.

**Nov 2 Update:**

As part of Atlassian's ongoing monitoring of this CVE, we observed publicly posted critical information about the vulnerability which increases risk of exploitation. There are still no reports of an active exploit, though customers must take immediate action to protect their instances. If you already applied the patch, no further action is required.

**Oct 31 Original:**

An Important Message from Bala Sathiamurthy, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

As part of our continuous security assessment processes, we have discovered that Confluence Data Center and Server customers are vulnerable to significant data loss if exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. There are no reports of active exploitation at this time; however, customers **must take immediate action** to protect their instances. Please read the Critical Security Advisory below for instructions and vulnerability details.

Protecting customers' instances is our top priority, and our prompt response demonstrates our dedication to ensuring the safety of our customers and your data. Atlassian is always reviewing security measures to reduce security risks and support our customers in taking timely action. Customers can expect to receive high-priority patches outside of our monthly advisory schedule as necessary. We believe that taking proactive action is the best approach and we appreciate your ongoing partnership.

All versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are affected by this unexploited vulnerability. This Improper Authorization vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create a Confluence instance administrator account. Using this account, an attacker can then perform all administrative actions that are available to Confluence instance administrator leading to - but not limited to - full loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server versions as listed below are at critical risk and require immediate attention. See ‘What You Need to Do’ for detailed instructions.

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an atlassian.net domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

This critical severity Improper Authorization vulnerability known as CVE-2023-22518 affects all versions prior to the listed fix versions of Confluence Data Center and Server. Versions outside of the support window (i.e. versions that have reached End of Life) may also be affected, so Atlassian recommends you upgrade to a fixed LTS version or later.

## Affected Versions

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center Confluence Server | All versions are affected |

## Fixed Versions

| Product | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center Confluence Server | * 7.19.16 * 8.3.4 * 8.4.4 * 8.5.3 * 8.6.1 |

## What You Need to Do

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade your instance to one of the versions listed in the “Fixed Versions” table section of this ticket. For full descriptions of the above versions of Confluence Data Center and Server, see the [release notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-release-notes-327.html). You can download the latest version of Confluence Data Center and Server from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives).

### Apply temporary mitigations if unable to patch

1. **Back up your instance.** (Instructions: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/production-backup-strategy-38797389.html>)
2. **Remove your instance from the internet until you can patch, if possible.** Instances accessible to the public internet, including those with user authentication, should be restricted from external network access until you can patch.
3. **If you cannot restrict external network access or patch**, apply the following interim measures to mitigate known attack vectors by blocking access on the following endpoints on Confluence instances:
   * /json/setup-restore.action
   * /json/setup-restore-local.action
   * /json/setup-restore-progress.action

* 1. This is possible at the network layer or by making the following changes to Confluence configuration files.

  On each node, modify /<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml and add the following block of code (just before the </web-app> tag at the end of the file):

| <security-constraint>         <web-resource-collection>             <url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>             <url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>             <url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>             <http-method-omission>\*</http-method-omission>         </web-resource-collection>     <auth-constraint /> </security-constraint> |
| --- |

* 2. Restart Confluence.

Note: These mitigation actions are limited and not a replacement for patching your instance; you must patch as soon as possible

> ### An Important Message from Bala Sathiamurthy, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
>
> As part of our continuous security assessment processes, we have discovered that Confluence Data Center and Server customers are vulnerable to significant data loss if exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. There are no reports of active exploitation at this time; customers **must take immediate action** to protect their instances. Please read the Critical Security Advisory below for instructions and vulnerability details.
>
> Protecting customers' instances is our top priority, and our prompt response demonstrates our dedication to ensuring the safety of our customers and your data. Atlassian is always reviewing security measures to reduce security risks and support our customers in taking timely action. Customers can expect to receive high-priority patches outside of our monthly advisory schedule as necessary. We believe that taking proactive action is the best approach and we appreciate your ongoing partnership.

All versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are affected by this vulnerability. This Improper Authorization vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create a Confluence instance administrator account. Using this account, an attacker can then perform all administrative actions that are available to Confluence instance administrator leading to a full loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server versions as listed below are at critical risk and require immediate attention. See ‘What You Need to Do’ for detailed instructions.

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an atlassian.net domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical (**10** with the following vector **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)**per our internal assessment.
This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Affected Versions

This Improper Authorization vulnerability affects all versions prior to the listed fix versions of Confluence Data Center and Server. Atlassian recommends patching to the fixed LTS version or later.

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | All versions are affected |

## What You Need To Do

### **Immediately patch to a fixed version**

Atlassian recommends that you patch each of your affected installations to one of the listed fixed versions (or the latest version) below.

| Product | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 7.19.16 * 8.3.4 * 8.4.4 * 8.5.3 * 8.6.1 |

### **Apply temporary mitigations if unable to patch**

1. **Back up your instance.** (Instructions: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/production-backup-strategy-38797389.html>)
2. **Remove your instance from the internet until you can patch, if possible.** Instances accessible to the public internet, including those with user authentication, should be restricted from external network access until you can patch.
3. **If you cannot restrict external network access or patch**, apply the following interim measures to mitigate known attack vectors by blocking access on the following endpoints on Confluence instances:
   1. `/json/setup-restore.action`
   2. `/json/setup-restore-local.action`
   3. `/json/setup-restore-progress.action`

This is possible at the network layer or by making the following changes to Confluence configuration files.

1. On each node, modify `/<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml` and add the following block of code (just before the `</web-app>` tag at the end of the file):

```
<security-constraint>
		<web-resource-collection>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>
			<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>
		</web-resource-collection>
	<auth-constraint />
</security-constraint>
```

2. Restart Confluence.

Note: These mitigation actions are limited and not a replacement for patching your instance; you must patch as soon as possible

### **Threat detection**

Atlassian cannot confirm if your instances have been affected by this vulnerability. You should engage your local security team to check all affected Confluence instances for evidence of compromise.

Evidence of compromise may include:

* loss of login access to the instance
* requests to `/json/setup-restore*` in network access logs
* installed unknown plugins

> ### An Important Message from Bala Sathiamurthy, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
>
> As part of our continuous security assessment processes, we have discovered that Confluence Data Center and Server customers are vulnerable to significant data loss if exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. There are no reports of active exploitation at this time; customers **must take immediate action** to protect their instances. Please read the Critical Security Advisory below for instructions and vulnerability details.
>
> Protecting customers' instances is our top priority, and our prompt response demonstrates our dedication to ensuring the safety of our customers and your data. Atlassian is always reviewing security measures to reduce security risks and support our customers in taking timely action. Customers can expect to receive high-priority patches outside of our monthly advisory schedule as necessary. We believe that taking proactive action is the best approach and we appreciate your ongoing partnership.

All versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are affected by this vulnerability. This Improper Authorization vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset Confluence and create a Confluence instance administrator account. Using this account, an attacker can then perform all administrative actions that are available to Confluence instance administrator leading to a full loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server versions as listed below are at critical risk and require immediate attention. See ‘What You Need to Do’ for detailed instructions.

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an atlassian.net domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical (**10** with the following vector **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)**per our internal assessment.
This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Affected Versions

This Improper Authorization vulnerability affects all versions prior to the listed fix versions of Confluence Data Center and Server. Atlassian recommends patching to the fixed LTS version or later.

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | All versions are affected |

## What You Need To Do

### **Immediately patch to a fixed version**

Atlassian recommends that you patch each of your affected installations to one of the listed fixed versions (or the latest version) below.

| Product | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 7.19.16 * 8.3.4 * 8.4.4 * 8.5.3 * 8.6.1 |

### **Apply temporary mitigations if unable to patch**

1. **Back up your instance.** (Instructions: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/production-backup-strategy-38797389.html>)
2. **Remove your instance from the internet until you can patch, if possible.** Instances accessible to the public internet, including those with user authentication, should be restricted from external network access until you can patch.
3. **If you cannot restrict external network access or patch**, apply the following interim measures to mitigate known attack vectors by blocking access on the following endpoints on Confluence instances:
   1. `/json/setup-restore.action`
   2. `/json/setup-restore-local.action`
   3. `/json/setup-restore-progress.action`

This is possible at the network layer or by making the following changes to Confluence configuration files.

1. On each node, modify `/<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml` and add the following block of code (just before the `</web-app>` tag at the end of the file):

```
<security-constraint>
		<web-resource-collection>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>
			<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>
			<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>
		</web-resource-collection>
	<auth-constraint />
</security-constraint>
```

2. Restart Confluence.

Note: These mitigation actions are limited and not a replacement for patching your instance; you must patch as soon as possible

### **Threat detection**

Atlassian cannot confirm if your instances have been affected by this vulnerability. You should engage your local security team to check all affected Confluence instances for evidence of compromise.

Evidence of compromise may include:

* loss of login access to the instance
* requests to `/json/setup-restore*` in network access logs
* installed unknown plugins
  + *we've observed reports of a malicious plugin named **web.shell.Plugin***
* encrypted files or corrupted data
* unexpected members of the`confluence-administrators`group
* unexpected newly created user accounts

If any evidence is found, you should assume that your instance has been compromised and follow your security incident response plan.
