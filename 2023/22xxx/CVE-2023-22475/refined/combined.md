# Cross-Site Scripting in Canarytoken history

Moderate

[azh-r](/azh-r)
published
GHSA-3h2c-3fgr-74vh
Jan 6, 2023

## Package

docker

Canarytokens
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< sha-10b9a13

## Patched versions

sha-fb61290

## Description

### Impact

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens.

An attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) can use this to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's trigger history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator.

This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location.

This vulnerability is similar to [GHSA-5675-3424-hpqr](https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/security/advisories/GHSA-5675-3424-hpqr), but affected parameters reported differently from the Canarytoken trigger request.

### Scope of impact

An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators.

### Patches

This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. We scanned Canarytokens.org for signs of malicious exploitation and did not find any.

Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image (or any Docker image after sha-fb61290):

```
$ docker pull thinkst/canarytokens:latest

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22475

# Cross-Site Scripting in Canarytoken history

Moderate

[thinkst-marco](/thinkst-marco)
published
GHSA-5675-3424-hpqr
Jul 1, 2022

## Package

docker

Canarytokens
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< sha-90e3a93

## Patched versions

sha-dc37895

## Description

### Impact

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens.

This permits an attacker who recognised an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator.

This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location.

### Scope of impact

An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators.

### Patches

The issue is patched on Canarytokens.org. We scanned the current Canarytokens.org database for signs of malicious exploitation and did not find any.

Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image (or any Docker image after `sha-dc37895`):

```
$ docker pull thinkst/canarytokens:latest

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
