    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network
*   **Web Pages:** The attack involves injecting malicious scripts into the Product List and Product Detail pages.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to access the manipulated pages, which would trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privilege:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious data that will be displayed on product list or detail pages. This is not clearly specified, but this suggests a privileged position to manipulate product data.
*   **No specific user interaction is needed:** The vulnerability is triggered when any user visits the affected product pages.
