# Improper Input Validation in kenny2automate

Moderate

[Kenny2github](/Kenny2github)
published
GHSA-73j8-xrcr-q6j7
Jan 2, 2023

## Package

kenny2automate
(Discord bot)

## Affected versions

< a947d7c

## Patched versions

a947d7c

## Description

### Impact

* In the web interface for server settings, form elements were generated with Discord channel IDs as part of input names.
* Prior to commit [a947d7c](https://github.com/Kenny2github/kenny2automate/commit/a947d7ce408687b587c7e6dfd6026f7c4ee31ac2), no validation was performed to ensure that the channel IDs submitted actually belonged to the server being configured. Thus anyone who has access to a) the channel ID they wish to change settings for and b) the server settings panel for *any* server could change settings for the requested channel no matter which server it belonged to.
* Impact: A fix has already been deployed. Thus this only affects people who have forked the repository and are running their own instance of the bot.

### Patches

Commit [a947d7c](https://github.com/Kenny2github/kenny2automate/commit/a947d7ce408687b587c7e6dfd6026f7c4ee31ac2) resolves the issue and has been deployed to the official instance of the bot.

### Workarounds

The only workaround that exists is to disable the web config entirely by changing it to run on localhost.

Note that a workaround is only necessary for those who run their own instance of the bot.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22452
