- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected products do not properly randomize MQTT ClientID parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could calculate the predictable MQTT ClientID parameter and use it to gather additional information about other InHand devices managed on the same cloud platform.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with network access to the affected devices can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.
