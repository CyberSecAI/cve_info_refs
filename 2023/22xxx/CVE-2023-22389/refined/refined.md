- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device stores passwords in a plaintext file when the device configuration is exported.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of passwords (CWE-256).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the exported configuration file can read the plaintext passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to access the exported device configuration file after it was saved via the "Save/Restoreâ€“>Backup Settings" option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the device and be able to export the configuration file or access the exported file. User interaction is required to initiate the export process.
