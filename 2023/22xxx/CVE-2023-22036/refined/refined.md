**1. CVE Description:**

The provided documents indicate that CVE-2023-22036 is a vulnerability in the OpenJDK Java runtime, which may result in a denial-of-service.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is not specified in the provided documents. The vulnerability is only listed as one of several issues in the OpenJDK.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- A vulnerability exists within the OpenJDK Java runtime.
- The specific weakness that leads to the denial of service is not described in detail in the provided documents

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is described as "Multiple" in the Oracle advisory, implying the vulnerability can be reached through various interfaces of the vulnerable software.
- The Netapp advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be triggered through network access ("AV:N") but also requires high complexity ("AC:H"), no user interaction ("UI:N"), and no privileges ("PR:N")

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker would need to be able to send network requests to a vulnerable service or application using a vulnerable version of OpenJDK.
   - No specific user interaction is necessary for the vulnerability to be triggered.
   - No authentication or specific privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided documents also list other CVEs that are fixed in the same updates to OpenJDK, affecting sandbox restrictions, information disclosure, AES implementation, and directory traversal. However, those are separate issues from CVE-2023-22036.
- The Oracle advisory includes "Utility" as the component affected, while Netapp highlights the Cloud Insights components of their product are specifically impacted.

**Summary of Relevant Information from Different Sources:**

*   **Debian Security Advisories (DSA 5478-1 and DSA 5458-1, DLA 3571-1):** These advisories confirm that CVE-2023-22036 is one of several vulnerabilities fixed in OpenJDK-11 and OpenJDK-17 updates. The impact is listed as "denial of service".
*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory:** This document acknowledges that CVE-2023-22036 was reported by "Eirik Bjørsnøs" and includes the component "Utility". It also lists other CVEs addressed in the same patch, and provides risk matrices for affected Oracle products.
*  **NetApp Security Advisory (NTAP-20230725-0006):** This advisory explicitly mentions CVE-2023-22036 as affecting the  "Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit" and  "Cloud Insights Storage Workload Security Agent" and lists CVSS scores indicating a low severity, and requiring high attack complexity.

In summary, CVE-2023-22036 represents a denial-of-service vulnerability in the OpenJDK Java runtime. The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, requires high attack complexity, but does not need user interaction or privileges, according to the Netapp advisory.
