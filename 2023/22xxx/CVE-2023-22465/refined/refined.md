- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `User-Agent` and `Server` header parsers in http4s are susceptible to a fatal error when processing certain inputs. The headers are parsed lazily.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper parsing of `User-Agent` and `Server` headers can lead to a fatal error. The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to access the typed headers using `req.headers.get(\`User-Agent\`)` or `req.headers.get[Server]`
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a fatal error, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based, triggered by sending crafted `User-Agent` or `Server` headers within an HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server. No privileges or user interaction is required.
