|  |  | v1.5.1 |
|  |  | ------ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 🔒 This is a security release to address CVE-2023-22742: when compiled using the optional, included libssh2 backend, libgit2 fails to verify SSH keys by default. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When using an SSH remote with the optional, included libssh2 backend, libgit2 does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2 require the caller to set the `certificate\_check` field of libgit2's `git\_remote\_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The libgit2 security team would like to thank the Julia and Rust security teams for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability and assisting with fixing the vulnerability. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | All users of the v1.5 release line are recommended to upgrade. |

libgit2, when compiled using the optional, included [libssh2](https://www.libssh2.org/) backend, fails to verify SSH keys by default.

## Description

When using an SSH remote with the optional, included libssh2 backend, libgit2 does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2 require the caller to set the certificate\_check field of libgit2's git\_remote\_callbacks structure - if a certificate check callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Beginning in libgit2 v1.4.5 and v1.5.1, libgit2 will now perform host key checking by default. Users can still override the default behavior using the certificate\_check function.

The libgit2 security team would like to thank the Julia and Rust security teams for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability and assisting with fixing the vulnerability.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.4.5 or v1.5.1.

Subject: Re: CVE-2022-46176: Cargo does not check SSH host keys

Hello all,

 > I think the libgit2 issue was never brought to oss-security, so I am
 > passing its mention to here now.  Also per that thread, CVE-2022-46176
 > is only for the Cargo issue.  libgit2 was supposed to get its own CVE,
 > but no one in the thread knew whether they actually did.

The Rust project was in contact with the libgit2 maintainers to coordinate the
two disclosures (that's why we mentioned it in the distros email), but some
miscommunication happened and the libgit2 side of the advisory didn't end up
being posted here by its maintainers.

libgit2's advisory is available here, and has CVE-2023-22742 assigned to it:

<https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq>

 > I don't know whether libgit2 was actually fixed on that date as planned.

The libgit2 advisory and fix ended up being published later, on January 20th.

Pietro.

## Package

libgit2

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

libgit2, when compiled using the optional, included [libssh2](https://www.libssh2.org) backend, fails to verify SSH keys by default.

## Description

When using an SSH remote with the optional, included libssh2 backend, libgit2 does *not* perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2 require the caller to set the `certificate_check` field of libgit2's `git_remote_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Beginning in libgit2 v1.4.5 and v1.5.1, libgit2 will now perform host key checking by default. Users can still override the default behavior using the `certificate_check` function.

The libgit2 security team would like to thank the Julia and Rust security teams for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability and assisting with fixing the vulnerability.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to [v1.4.5](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/releases/tag/v1.4.5) or [v1.5.1](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/releases/tag/v1.5.1).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

libgit2, when compiled using the optional, included [libssh2](https://www.libssh2.org/) backend, fails to verify SSH keys by default.

## Description

When using an SSH remote with the optional, included libssh2 backend, libgit2 does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2 require the caller to set the certificate\_check field of libgit2's git\_remote\_callbacks structure - if a certificate check callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Beginning in libgit2 v1.4.5 and v1.5.1, libgit2 will now perform host key checking by default. Users can still override the default behavior using the certificate\_check function.

The libgit2 security team would like to thank the Julia and Rust security teams for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability and assisting with fixing the vulnerability.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.4.5 or v1.5.1.
