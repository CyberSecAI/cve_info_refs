{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request targeting the vulnerable plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
