Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-22460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "json" codec in `go-ipld-prime` was not designed to handle `Bytes` kind nodes (byte arrays) during encoding. When it encountered a `Bytes` node, it would pass a `Bytes` token to the underlying JSON encoder, which was not prepared to handle it, leading to a panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of `Bytes` kind nodes by the "json" codec during encoding.
- Lack of error handling when attempting to encode `Bytes` using the "json" codec.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A panic would occur if the "json" codec is used to encode data containing `Bytes` kind nodes, potentially causing a service disruption or denial-of-service if not properly handled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could provide crafted data with `Bytes` kind nodes to be encoded using the "json" codec, triggering the panic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to control or influence the data being encoded using the "json" codec.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects the "json" codec. The "dag-json" codec is not affected as it is designed to handle `Bytes` and `Links`.
- The fix is implemented in version `0.19.0` of `go-ipld-prime`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by `@hacdias`.
- The fix was implemented in pull request [#472](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472).
- The recommended workaround is to use the "dag-json" codec instead of "json" for encoding when dealing with data that includes byte arrays.
