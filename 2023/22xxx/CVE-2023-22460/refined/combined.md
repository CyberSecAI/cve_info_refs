### @rvagg **[rvagg](/rvagg)** commented [Oct 13, 2022](#issue-1407087132)

The plain JSON codec shouldn't be able to encode bytes or links and should consistently error. The DAG-JSON codec should be able to, of course.

I'll do a simple 0.18.1 after this, but in a separate PR that updates the changelog and does the proper release process.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[`ac99fc3`](/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/ac99fc3ecbe040a04ff4dcb83a00c9f65e863b15)

go-ipld-prime's release policy says that:

> even numbers should be easy upgrades; odd numbers may change things

The only major, potentially disruptive change in this release is a bump to Go 1.18.

#### 🛠 Breaking Changes

Update go.mod to Go 1.18.

#### 🔦 Highlights

* **Codecs**: [Correct JSON codec Bytes handling](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472). This change does not impact DAG-JSON, which is the generally recommended codec for JSON output as the JSON codec cannot properly handle Bytes or Links.
* **Dependencies**:
  + Update to go-multihash@v0.2.1: <https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/releases/tag/v0.2.1>
  + Update to go-multicodec@v0.6.0: <https://github.com/multiformats/go-multicodec/releases/tag/v0.6.0>
  + Update to go-cid@v0.3.2: [ipfs/go-cid@v0.2.0...v0.3.2](https://github.com/ipfs/go-cid/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.2)

# "json" codec may panic if asked to encode bytes

Moderate

[rvagg](/rvagg)
published
GHSA-c653-6hhg-9x92
Jan 3, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/codec/json
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<0.19.0

## Patched versions

0.19.0

## Description

### Impact

Encoding data which contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes.

**This only impacts uses of the "json" codec, "dag-json" is not impacted.** Use of "json" as a decoder is not impacted.

### Patches

Fixed in v0.19.0.

### Workarounds

Prefer the "dag-json" codec which has the ability to [encode bytes](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/#bytes).

### References

See fix in [#472](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472)
