- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A polynomial time complexity issue in the `handle_close_bracket` function within the `cmark-gfm` library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from a quadratic time complexity bug, which allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service by providing a specially crafted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause unbounded resource exhaustion, leading to a denial of service. This can be achieved by crafting input that makes the parser take a significantly long time to process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by feeding the `cmark-gfm` library with a specific input containing many nested brackets and exclamation marks such as `![[]()` repeated many times.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide an input to be processed by the vulnerable markdown parser. The provided example is a command that pipes the crafted string to the `cmark-gfm` command-line tool.
