### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Jan 9, 2023](#issue-1526172717)

This change is to move local\_infile parameter from connection extra to Hook. Since this feature is only used for very specific cases, it belongs to the "action" it executes not to the connection defined in general. For example in Hive and Vertica transfers, the capability of local\_inline is simply exnabled by bulk\_load parameter - and it allows to use the same connection in both cases.
