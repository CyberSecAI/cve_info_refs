- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Auto Affiliate Links plugin (versions <= 6.3) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that is sent to the vulnerable website. This request would be triggered by a logged-in user without their consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing the malicious request. The attacker does not require authentication.
