# Sensitive information exposure in the logs of greader API

Moderate

[Alkarex](/Alkarex)
published
GHSA-8vvv-jxg6-8578
Mar 4, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 1.9.0

## Patched versions

>= 1.21.0

## Description

### Summary

When using the greader API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication fails.

### Details

The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`.

If there is an issue with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called.

Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs. `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request, eventually containing something like

```
    [_POST] => Array
        (
            [Email] => me
            [Passwd] => test
            [T] =>
        )

    [_COOKIE] => Array
        (
        )

    [INPUT] => Email=me&Passwd=test&T=

```

By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well.

### PoC

This can be reproduced as follows:

Try to log in using the Google compatible API and wrong credentials.

I used ReadKit (iOS version 3.1.1) and FreshRSS (production env) version `1.21.0-dev` (docker image `freshrss/freshrss:edge`)

### Impact

The issue requires to have access to logs produced by FreshRSS (potentially any logged user on the machine, since the default configuration is also writing logs into syslog)

Using the information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or passwords (it is easy to make a mistake and try to log in with the password rather than with the API key)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
