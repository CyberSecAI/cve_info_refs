Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `debugInfo()` function in `p/api/greader.php` logs the full request details, including the `Passwd` parameter in cleartext when authentication fails in the `authorizationToUser()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Sensitive Information Exposure (CWE-532):** Passwords and potentially API keys are being logged in cleartext to the `users/_/log_api.txt` file when authentication to the greader API fails.
- The `debugInfo()` function in both `p/api/fever.php` and `p/api/greader.php` were modified to include the request information which includes sensitive information like passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious individual with access to FreshRSS logs can obtain users' passwords or API keys.
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially other resources protected by the stolen credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when an attempt to authenticate via the Google Reader API fails (e.g. using incorrect credentials with ReadKit).
- It requires the attacker to gain access to the server's log files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have access to the FreshRSS log files (`users/_/log_api.txt`). The default configuration also logs to syslog, making the vulnerability more accessible.
- The attacker also needs to send a request using the greader API with incorrect credentials to trigger the logging of the cleartext password.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involves sanitizing the log output by redacting sensitive data such as the `Passwd` parameter from the logs.
- The advisory references a commit that implements a fix for the issue, which includes the redaction of passwords and tokens from the logs.
- The affected versions are `1.9.0` and later prior to the patched version. The vulnerability is fixed in version `1.21.0` and later.
- The CVSS score is 4.0, which is considered moderate, with a CVSS:3.1 vector of AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
