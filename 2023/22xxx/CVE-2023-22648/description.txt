A Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher causes permission changes in Azure AD not to be reflected to users 
while they are logged in the Rancher UI. This would cause the users to 
retain their previous permissions in Rancher, even if they change groups
 on Azure AD, for example, to a lower privileged group, or are removed 
from a group, thus retaining their access to Rancher instead of losing 
it.
This issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.7 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4.
