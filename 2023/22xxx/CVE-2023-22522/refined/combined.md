## Summary of Vulnerability

This Template Injection vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker, including one with anonymous access, to inject unsafe user input into a Confluence page. Using this approach, an attacker is able to achieve RCE on an affected instance. Confluence Data Center and Server versions as listed below are at risk and require immediate attention. See “What You Need to Do” for detailed instructions.

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical (**9.0** with the following vector **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**) per our internal assessment.
This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Affected Versions

This RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability affects all versions including and after 4.0.0 of Confluence Data Center and Server. Atlassian recommends patching to the latest version or a fixed LTS version.

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 4.x.x * 5.x.x * 6.x.x * 7.x.x * 8.0.x * 8.1.x * 8.2.x * 8.3.x * 8.4.0 * 8.4.1 * 8.4.2 * 8.4.3 * 8.4.4 * 8.5.0 * 8.5.1 * 8.5.2 * 8.5.3 |
| Confluence Data Center | * 8.6.0 * 8.6.1 |

## What You Need To Do

### **Immediately patch to a fixed version**

Atlassian recommends that you patch each of your affected installations to the latest version or one of the listed fixed versions below.

| Product | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 7.19.17 (LTS) * 8.4.5 * 8.5.4 (LTS) |
| Confluence Data Center | * 8.6.2 or later (Data Center Only) * 8.7.1 or later (Data Center Only) |

### **Apply temporary mitigations if unable to patch**

There is no current mitigation, however we recommend:

* **Back up your instance.** (Instructions: <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/production-backup-strategy-38797389.html>)
* **Remove your instance from the internet until you can patch.** Instances accessible to the public internet, including those with user authentication, should be restricted from external network access until you can patch.

Note: Before restoring your instance to the public internet you must apply the latest fix version.
