Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information into a log file by the Open CAS software.
*   **Weakness:** The software logs potentially sensitive data, which is a form of information exposure.
*   **Impact:** A privileged user with local access can potentially view this sensitive information, leading to information disclosure.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access, requiring the attacker to have a privileged user account on the system where Open CAS is running.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user and have local access to the system where the vulnerable version of Open CAS is installed. User interaction is required

The advisory provides more detail than the basic CVE description, specifying that the vulnerable software is Open CAS for Linux, and the sensitive information is logged to a log file. The advisory also specifies the vulnerable version range, and provides mitigation and relevant CVSS score/vector information.
