### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| The EXPLAIN feature (unavoidably) exposes data to PgHero users to varying degrees. EXPLAIN EXPLAIN exposes statistical data through its output, since Postgres uses statistics about data in the database to generate the execution plan. A malicious user could learn these statistics in certain cases, as estimations will be different for similar queries.  You can view this data by querying the [pg\_stats](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats.html) view.  ``` SELECT * FROM pg_stats; ``` EXPLAIN ANALYZE EXPLAIN ANALYZE exposes data through timing. For instance, this query will take extra time if the given email exists.  ``` EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT CASE WHEN email = 'test@example.com' THEN pg_sleep(1) ELSE NULL END FROM users; ```  See this [great write-up](https://hackernoon.com/timing-based-blind-sql-attacks-bd276dc618dd) by Adam Derewecki. Changes in 3.1 Starting with PgHero 3.1, teams now have control over this feature. There's a new `explain` option that allows the Explain page to be disabled.  ``` explain: false ```  Also, EXPLAIN ANALYZE is now opt-in. You can enable it with:  ``` explain: analyze ```  Please create a new issue if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback. |

The functions described in this section are used to control and monitor a PostgreSQL installation.

### 9.28.1. Configuration Settings Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SET)

[Table 9.93](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SET-TABLE "Table 9.93. Configuration Settings Functions") shows the functions available to query and alter run-time configuration parameters.

**Table 9.93. Configuration Settings Functions**

| Function  Description  Example(s) |
| --- |
| `current_setting` ( *`setting_name`* `text` [, *`missing_ok`* `boolean` ] ) → `text`  Returns the current value of the setting *`setting_name`*. If there is no such setting, `current_setting` throws an error unless *`missing_ok`* is supplied and is `true` (in which case NULL is returned). This function corresponds to the SQL command [SHOW](sql-show.html "SHOW").  `current_setting('datestyle')` → `ISO, MDY` |
| `set_config` ( *`setting_name`* `text`, *`new_value`* `text`, *`is_local`* `boolean` ) → `text`  Sets the parameter *`setting_name`* to *`new_value`*, and returns that value. If *`is_local`* is `true`, the new value will only apply during the current transaction. If you want the new value to apply for the rest of the current session, use `false` instead. This function corresponds to the SQL command [SET](sql-set.html "SET").  `set_config('log_statement_stats', 'off', false)` → `off` |

### 9.28.2. Server Signaling Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SIGNAL)

The functions shown in [Table 9.94](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SIGNAL-TABLE "Table 9.94. Server Signaling Functions") send control signals to other server processes. Use of these functions is restricted to superusers by default but access may be granted to others using `GRANT`, with noted exceptions.

Each of these functions returns `true` if the signal was successfully sent and `false` if sending the signal failed.

**Table 9.94. Server Signaling Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_cancel_backend` ( *`pid`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Cancels the current query of the session whose backend process has the specified process ID. This is also allowed if the calling role is a member of the role whose backend is being canceled or the calling role has privileges of `pg_signal_backend`, however only superusers can cancel superuser backends. |
| `pg_log_backend_memory_contexts` ( *`pid`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Requests to log the memory contexts of the backend with the specified process ID. This function can send the request to backends and auxiliary processes except logger. These memory contexts will be logged at `LOG` message level. They will appear in the server log based on the log configuration set (see [Section 19.8](runtime-config-logging.html "19.8. Error Reporting and Logging") for more information), but will not be sent to the client regardless of [client\_min\_messages](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-CLIENT-MIN-MESSAGES). |
| `pg_reload_conf` () → `boolean`  Causes all processes of the PostgreSQL server to reload their configuration files. (This is initiated by sending a SIGHUP signal to the postmaster process, which in turn sends SIGHUP to each of its children.) You can use the [`pg_file_settings`](view-pg-file-settings.html "52.7. pg_file_settings"), [`pg_hba_file_rules`](view-pg-hba-file-rules.html "52.9. pg_hba_file_rules") and [`pg_ident_file_mappings`](view-pg-ident-file-mappings.html "52.10. pg_ident_file_mappings") views to check the configuration files for possible errors, before reloading. |
| `pg_rotate_logfile` () → `boolean`  Signals the log-file manager to switch to a new output file immediately. This works only when the built-in log collector is running, since otherwise there is no log-file manager subprocess. |
| `pg_terminate_backend` ( *`pid`* `integer`, *`timeout`* `bigint` `DEFAULT` `0` ) → `boolean`  Terminates the session whose backend process has the specified process ID. This is also allowed if the calling role is a member of the role whose backend is being terminated or the calling role has privileges of `pg_signal_backend`, however only superusers can terminate superuser backends.  If *`timeout`* is not specified or zero, this function returns `true` whether the process actually terminates or not, indicating only that the sending of the signal was successful. If the *`timeout`* is specified (in milliseconds) and greater than zero, the function waits until the process is actually terminated or until the given time has passed. If the process is terminated, the function returns `true`. On timeout, a warning is emitted and `false` is returned. |

`pg_cancel_backend` and `pg_terminate_backend` send signals (SIGINT or SIGTERM respectively) to backend processes identified by process ID. The process ID of an active backend can be found from the `pid` column of the `pg_stat_activity` view, or by listing the `postgres` processes on the server (using ps on Unix or the Task Manager on Windows). The role of an active backend can be found from the `usename` column of the `pg_stat_activity` view.

`pg_log_backend_memory_contexts` can be used to log the memory contexts of a backend process. For example:

```

postgres=# SELECT pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(pg_backend_pid());
 pg_log_backend_memory_contexts
--------------------------------
 t
(1 row)

```

One message for each memory context will be logged. For example:

```

LOG:  logging memory contexts of PID 10377
STATEMENT:  SELECT pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(pg_backend_pid());
LOG:  level: 0; TopMemoryContext: 80800 total in 6 blocks; 14432 free (5 chunks); 66368 used
LOG:  level: 1; pgstat TabStatusArray lookup hash table: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 1408 free (0 chunks); 6784 used
LOG:  level: 1; TopTransactionContext: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 7720 free (1 chunks); 472 used
LOG:  level: 1; RowDescriptionContext: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 6880 free (0 chunks); 1312 used
LOG:  level: 1; MessageContext: 16384 total in 2 blocks; 5152 free (0 chunks); 11232 used
LOG:  level: 1; Operator class cache: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 512 free (0 chunks); 7680 used
LOG:  level: 1; smgr relation table: 16384 total in 2 blocks; 4544 free (3 chunks); 11840 used
LOG:  level: 1; TransactionAbortContext: 32768 total in 1 blocks; 32504 free (0 chunks); 264 used
...
LOG:  level: 1; ErrorContext: 8192 total in 1 blocks; 7928 free (3 chunks); 264 used
LOG:  Grand total: 1651920 bytes in 201 blocks; 622360 free (88 chunks); 1029560 used

```

If there are more than 100 child contexts under the same parent, the first 100 child contexts are logged, along with a summary of the remaining contexts. Note that frequent calls to this function could incur significant overhead, because it may generate a large number of log messages.

### 9.28.3. Backup Control Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-BACKUP)

The functions shown in [Table 9.95](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-BACKUP-TABLE "Table 9.95. Backup Control Functions") assist in making on-line backups. These functions cannot be executed during recovery (except `pg_backup_start`, `pg_backup_stop`, and `pg_wal_lsn_diff`).

For details about proper usage of these functions, see [Section 25.3](continuous-archiving.html "25.3. Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)").

**Table 9.95. Backup Control Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_create_restore_point` ( *`name`* `text` ) → `pg_lsn`  Creates a named marker record in the write-ahead log that can later be used as a recovery target, and returns the corresponding write-ahead log location. The given name can then be used with [recovery\_target\_name](runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-NAME) to specify the point up to which recovery will proceed. Avoid creating multiple restore points with the same name, since recovery will stop at the first one whose name matches the recovery target.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_current_wal_flush_lsn` () → `pg_lsn`  Returns the current write-ahead log flush location (see notes below). |
| `pg_current_wal_insert_lsn` () → `pg_lsn`  Returns the current write-ahead log insert location (see notes below). |
| `pg_current_wal_lsn` () → `pg_lsn`  Returns the current write-ahead log write location (see notes below). |
| `pg_backup_start` ( *`label`* `text` [, *`fast`* `boolean` ] ) → `pg_lsn`  Prepares the server to begin an on-line backup. The only required parameter is an arbitrary user-defined label for the backup. (Typically this would be the name under which the backup dump file will be stored.) If the optional second parameter is given as `true`, it specifies executing `pg_backup_start` as quickly as possible. This forces an immediate checkpoint which will cause a spike in I/O operations, slowing any concurrently executing queries.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_backup_stop` ( [*`wait_for_archive`* `boolean` ] ) → `record` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`labelfile`* `text`, *`spcmapfile`* `text` )  Finishes performing an on-line backup. The desired contents of the backup label file and the tablespace map file are returned as part of the result of the function and must be written to files in the backup area. These files must not be written to the live data directory (doing so will cause PostgreSQL to fail to restart in the event of a crash).  There is an optional parameter of type `boolean`. If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed, without waiting for WAL to be archived. This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving. Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless. By default or when this parameter is true, `pg_backup_stop` will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is enabled. (On a standby, this means that it will wait only when `archive_mode` = `always`. If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run `pg_switch_wal` on the primary in order to trigger an immediate segment switch.)  When executed on a primary, this function also creates a backup history file in the write-ahead log archive area. The history file includes the label given to `pg_backup_start`, the starting and ending write-ahead log locations for the backup, and the starting and ending times of the backup. After recording the ending location, the current write-ahead log insertion point is automatically advanced to the next write-ahead log file, so that the ending write-ahead log file can be archived immediately to complete the backup.  The result of the function is a single record. The *`lsn`* column holds the backup's ending write-ahead log location (which again can be ignored). The second column returns the contents of the backup label file, and the third column returns the contents of the tablespace map file. These must be stored as part of the backup and are required as part of the restore process.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_switch_wal` () → `pg_lsn`  Forces the server to switch to a new write-ahead log file, which allows the current file to be archived (assuming you are using continuous archiving). The result is the ending write-ahead log location plus 1 within the just-completed write-ahead log file. If there has been no write-ahead log activity since the last write-ahead log switch, `pg_switch_wal` does nothing and returns the start location of the write-ahead log file currently in use.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_walfile_name` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` ) → `text`  Converts a write-ahead log location to the name of the WAL file holding that location. |
| `pg_walfile_name_offset` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` ) → `record` ( *`file_name`* `text`, *`file_offset`* `integer` )  Converts a write-ahead log location to a WAL file name and byte offset within that file. |
| `pg_split_walfile_name` ( *`file_name`* `text` ) → `record` ( *`segment_number`* `numeric`, *`timeline_id`* `bigint` )  Extracts the sequence number and timeline ID from a WAL file name. |
| `pg_wal_lsn_diff` ( *`lsn1`* `pg_lsn`, *`lsn2`* `pg_lsn` ) → `numeric`  Calculates the difference in bytes (*`lsn1`* - *`lsn2`*) between two write-ahead log locations. This can be used with `pg_stat_replication` or some of the functions shown in [Table 9.95](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-BACKUP-TABLE "Table 9.95. Backup Control Functions") to get the replication lag. |

`pg_current_wal_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log write location in the same format used by the above functions. Similarly, `pg_current_wal_insert_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log insertion location and `pg_current_wal_flush_lsn` displays the current write-ahead log flush location. The insertion location is the “logical” end of the write-ahead log at any instant, while the write location is the end of what has actually been written out from the server's internal buffers, and the flush location is the last location known to be written to durable storage. The write location is the end of what can be examined from outside the server, and is usually what you want if you are interested in archiving partially-complete write-ahead log files. The insertion and flush locations are made available primarily for server debugging purposes. These are all read-only operations and do not require superuser permissions.

You can use `pg_walfile_name_offset` to extract the corresponding write-ahead log file name and byte offset from a `pg_lsn` value. For example:

```

postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_walfile_name_offset((pg_backup_stop()).lsn);
        file_name         | file_offset
--------------------------+-------------
 00000001000000000000000D |     4039624
(1 row)

```

Similarly, `pg_walfile_name` extracts just the write-ahead log file name.

`pg_split_walfile_name` is useful to compute a LSN from a file offset and WAL file name, for example:

```

postgres=# \set file_name '000000010000000100C000AB'
postgres=# \set offset 256
postgres=# SELECT '0/0'::pg_lsn + pd.segment_number * ps.setting::int + :offset AS lsn
  FROM pg_split_walfile_name(:'file_name') pd,
       pg_show_all_settings() ps
  WHERE ps.name = 'wal_segment_size';
      lsn
---------------
 C001/AB000100
(1 row)

```

### 9.28.4. Recovery Control Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-RECOVERY-CONTROL)

The functions shown in [Table 9.96](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-RECOVERY-INFO-TABLE "Table 9.96. Recovery Information Functions") provide information about the current status of a standby server. These functions may be executed both during recovery and in normal running.

**Table 9.96. Recovery Information Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_is_in_recovery` () → `boolean`  Returns true if recovery is still in progress. |
| `pg_last_wal_receive_lsn` () → `pg_lsn`  Returns the last write-ahead log location that has been received and synced to disk by streaming replication. While streaming replication is in progress this will increase monotonically. If recovery has completed then this will remain static at the location of the last WAL record received and synced to disk during recovery. If streaming replication is disabled, or if it has not yet started, the function returns `NULL`. |
| `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn` () → `pg_lsn`  Returns the last write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery. If recovery is still in progress this will increase monotonically. If recovery has completed then this will remain static at the location of the last WAL record applied during recovery. When the server has been started normally without recovery, the function returns `NULL`. |
| `pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp` () → `timestamp with time zone`  Returns the time stamp of the last transaction replayed during recovery. This is the time at which the commit or abort WAL record for that transaction was generated on the primary. If no transactions have been replayed during recovery, the function returns `NULL`. Otherwise, if recovery is still in progress this will increase monotonically. If recovery has completed then this will remain static at the time of the last transaction applied during recovery. When the server has been started normally without recovery, the function returns `NULL`. |
| `pg_get_wal_resource_managers` () → `setof record` ( *`rm_id`* `integer`, *`rm_name`* `text`, *`rm_builtin`* `boolean` )  Returns the currently-loaded WAL resource managers in the system. The column *`rm_builtin`* indicates whether it's a built-in resource manager, or a custom resource manager loaded by an extension. |

The functions shown in [Table 9.97](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-RECOVERY-CONTROL-TABLE "Table 9.97. Recovery Control Functions") control the progress of recovery. These functions may be executed only during recovery.

**Table 9.97. Recovery Control Functions**

| `pg_is_wal_replay_paused` () → `boolean`  Returns true if recovery pause is requested. |
| `pg_get_wal_replay_pause_state` () → `text`  Returns recovery pause state. The return values are `not paused` if pause is not requested, `pause requested` if pause is requested but recovery is not yet paused, and `paused` if the recovery is actually paused. |
| `pg_promote` ( *`wait`* `boolean` `DEFAULT` `true`, *`wait_seconds`* `integer` `DEFAULT` `60` ) → `boolean`  Promotes a standby server to primary status. With *`wait`* set to `true` (the default), the function waits until promotion is completed or *`wait_seconds`* seconds have passed, and returns `true` if promotion is successful and `false` otherwise. If *`wait`* is set to `false`, the function returns `true` immediately after sending a `SIGUSR1` signal to the postmaster to trigger promotion.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_wal_replay_pause` () → `void`  Request to pause recovery. A request doesn't mean that recovery stops right away. If you want a guarantee that recovery is actually paused, you need to check for the recovery pause state returned by `pg_get_wal_replay_pause_state()`. Note that `pg_is_wal_replay_paused()` returns whether a request is made. While recovery is paused, no further database changes are applied. If hot standby is active, all new queries will see the same consistent snapshot of the database, and no further query conflicts will be generated until recovery is resumed.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_wal_replay_resume` () → `void`  Restarts recovery if it was paused.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |

`pg_wal_replay_pause` and `pg_wal_replay_resume` cannot be executed while a promotion is ongoing. If a promotion is triggered while recovery is paused, the paused state ends and promotion continues.

If streaming replication is disabled, the paused state may continue indefinitely without a problem. If streaming replication is in progress then WAL records will continue to be received, which will eventually fill available disk space, depending upon the duration of the pause, the rate of WAL generation and available disk space.

### 9.28.5. Snapshot Synchronization Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-SNAPSHOT-SYNCHRONIZATION)

PostgreSQL allows database sessions to synchronize their snapshots. A *snapshot* determines which data is visible to the transaction that is using the snapshot. Synchronized snapshots are necessary when two or more sessions need to see identical content in the database. If two sessions just start their transactions independently, there is always a possibility that some third transaction commits between the executions of the two `START TRANSACTION` commands, so that one session sees the effects of that transaction and the other does not.

To solve this problem, PostgreSQL allows a transaction to *export* the snapshot it is using. As long as the exporting transaction remains open, other transactions can *import* its snapshot, and thereby be guaranteed that they see exactly the same view of the database that the first transaction sees. But note that any database changes made by any one of these transactions remain invisible to the other transactions, as is usual for changes made by uncommitted transactions. So the transactions are synchronized with respect to pre-existing data, but act normally for changes they make themselves.

Snapshots are exported with the `pg_export_snapshot` function, shown in [Table 9.98](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-SNAPSHOT-SYNCHRONIZATION-TABLE "Table 9.98. Snapshot Synchronization Functions"), and imported with the [SET TRANSACTION](sql-set-transaction.html "SET TRANSACTION") command.

**Table 9.98. Snapshot Synchronization Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_export_snapshot` () → `text`  Saves the transaction's current snapshot and returns a `text` string identifying the snapshot. This string must be passed (outside the database) to clients that want to import the snapshot. The snapshot is available for import only until the end of the transaction that exported it.  A transaction can export more than one snapshot, if needed. Note that doing so is only useful in `READ COMMITTED` transactions, since in `REPEATABLE READ` and higher isolation levels, transactions use the same snapshot throughout their lifetime. Once a transaction has exported any snapshots, it cannot be prepared with [PREPARE TRANSACTION](sql-prepare-transaction.html "PREPARE TRANSACTION"). |
| `pg_log_standby_snapshot` () → `pg_lsn`  Take a snapshot of running transactions and write it to WAL, without having to wait for bgwriter or checkpointer to log one. This is useful for logical decoding on standby, as logical slot creation has to wait until such a record is replayed on the standby. |

### 9.28.6. Replication Management Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-REPLICATION)

The functions shown in [Table 9.99](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-REPLICATION-TABLE "Table 9.99. Replication Management Functions") are for controlling and interacting with replication features. See [Section 26.2.5](warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION "26.2.5. Streaming Replication"), [Section 26.2.6](warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-SLOTS "26.2.6. Replication Slots"), and [Chapter 48](replication-origins.html "Chapter 48. Replication Progress Tracking") for information about the underlying features. Use of functions for replication origin is only allowed to the superuser by default, but may be allowed to other users by using the `GRANT` command. Use of functions for replication slots is restricted to superusers and users having `REPLICATION` privilege.

Many of these functions have equivalent commands in the replication protocol; see [Section 53.4](protocol-replication.html "53.4. Streaming Replication Protocol").

The functions described in [Section 9.28.3](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-BACKUP "9.28.3. Backup Control Functions"), [Section 9.28.4](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-RECOVERY-CONTROL "9.28.4. Recovery Control Functions"), and [Section 9.28.5](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-SNAPSHOT-SYNCHRONIZATION "9.28.5. Snapshot Synchronization Functions") are also relevant for replication.

**Table 9.99. Replication Management Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_create_physical_replication_slot` ( *`slot_name`* `name` [, *`immediately_reserve`* `boolean`, *`temporary`* `boolean` ] ) → `record` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` )  Creates a new physical replication slot named *`slot_name`*. The optional second parameter, when `true`, specifies that the LSN for this replication slot be reserved immediately; otherwise the LSN is reserved on first connection from a streaming replication client. Streaming changes from a physical slot is only possible with the streaming-replication protocol — see [Section 53.4](protocol-replication.html "53.4. Streaming Replication Protocol"). The optional third parameter, *`temporary`*, when set to true, specifies that the slot should not be permanently stored to disk and is only meant for use by the current session. Temporary slots are also released upon any error. This function corresponds to the replication protocol command `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT ... PHYSICAL`. |
| `pg_drop_replication_slot` ( *`slot_name`* `name` ) → `void`  Drops the physical or logical replication slot named *`slot_name`*. Same as replication protocol command `DROP_REPLICATION_SLOT`. For logical slots, this must be called while connected to the same database the slot was created on. |
| `pg_create_logical_replication_slot` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`plugin`* `name` [, *`temporary`* `boolean`, *`twophase`* `boolean`, *`failover`* `boolean` ] ) → `record` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` )  Creates a new logical (decoding) replication slot named *`slot_name`* using the output plugin *`plugin`*. The optional third parameter, *`temporary`*, when set to true, specifies that the slot should not be permanently stored to disk and is only meant for use by the current session. Temporary slots are also released upon any error. The optional fourth parameter, *`twophase`*, when set to true, specifies that the decoding of prepared transactions is enabled for this slot. The optional fifth parameter, *`failover`*, when set to true, specifies that this slot is enabled to be synced to the standbys so that logical replication can be resumed after failover. A call to this function has the same effect as the replication protocol command `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT ... LOGICAL`. |
| `pg_copy_physical_replication_slot` ( *`src_slot_name`* `name`, *`dst_slot_name`* `name` [, *`temporary`* `boolean` ] ) → `record` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` )  Copies an existing physical replication slot named *`src_slot_name`* to a physical replication slot named *`dst_slot_name`*. The copied physical slot starts to reserve WAL from the same LSN as the source slot. *`temporary`* is optional. If *`temporary`* is omitted, the same value as the source slot is used. |
| `pg_copy_logical_replication_slot` ( *`src_slot_name`* `name`, *`dst_slot_name`* `name` [, *`temporary`* `boolean` [, *`plugin`* `name` ]] ) → `record` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` )  Copies an existing logical replication slot named *`src_slot_name`* to a logical replication slot named *`dst_slot_name`*, optionally changing the output plugin and persistence. The copied logical slot starts from the same LSN as the source logical slot. Both *`temporary`* and *`plugin`* are optional; if they are omitted, the values of the source slot are used. |
| `pg_logical_slot_get_changes` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`upto_lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`upto_nchanges`* `integer`, `VARIADIC` *`options`* `text[]` ) → `setof record` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`xid`* `xid`, *`data`* `text` )  Returns changes in the slot *`slot_name`*, starting from the point from which changes have been consumed last. If *`upto_lsn`* and *`upto_nchanges`* are NULL, logical decoding will continue until end of WAL. If *`upto_lsn`* is non-NULL, decoding will include only those transactions which commit prior to the specified LSN. If *`upto_nchanges`* is non-NULL, decoding will stop when the number of rows produced by decoding exceeds the specified value. Note, however, that the actual number of rows returned may be larger, since this limit is only checked after adding the rows produced when decoding each new transaction commit. If the specified slot is a logical failover slot then the function will not return until all physical slots specified in [`synchronized_standby_slots`](runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-SYNCHRONIZED-STANDBY-SLOTS) have confirmed WAL receipt. |
| `pg_logical_slot_peek_changes` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`upto_lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`upto_nchanges`* `integer`, `VARIADIC` *`options`* `text[]` ) → `setof record` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`xid`* `xid`, *`data`* `text` )  Behaves just like the `pg_logical_slot_get_changes()` function, except that changes are not consumed; that is, they will be returned again on future calls. |
| `pg_logical_slot_get_binary_changes` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`upto_lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`upto_nchanges`* `integer`, `VARIADIC` *`options`* `text[]` ) → `setof record` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`xid`* `xid`, *`data`* `bytea` )  Behaves just like the `pg_logical_slot_get_changes()` function, except that changes are returned as `bytea`. |
| `pg_logical_slot_peek_binary_changes` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`upto_lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`upto_nchanges`* `integer`, `VARIADIC` *`options`* `text[]` ) → `setof record` ( *`lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`xid`* `xid`, *`data`* `bytea` )  Behaves just like the `pg_logical_slot_peek_changes()` function, except that changes are returned as `bytea`. |
| `pg_replication_slot_advance` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`upto_lsn`* `pg_lsn` ) → `record` ( *`slot_name`* `name`, *`end_lsn`* `pg_lsn` )  Advances the current confirmed position of a replication slot named *`slot_name`*. The slot will not be moved backwards, and it will not be moved beyond the current insert location. Returns the name of the slot and the actual position that it was advanced to. The updated slot position information is written out at the next checkpoint if any advancing is done. So in the event of a crash, the slot may return to an earlier position. If the specified slot is a logical failover slot then the function will not return until all physical slots specified in [`synchronized_standby_slots`](runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-SYNCHRONIZED-STANDBY-SLOTS) have confirmed WAL receipt. |
| `pg_replication_origin_create` ( *`node_name`* `text` ) → `oid`  Creates a replication origin with the given external name, and returns the internal ID assigned to it. |
| `pg_replication_origin_drop` ( *`node_name`* `text` ) → `void`  Deletes a previously-created replication origin, including any associated replay progress. |
| `pg_replication_origin_oid` ( *`node_name`* `text` ) → `oid`  Looks up a replication origin by name and returns the internal ID. If no such replication origin is found, `NULL` is returned. |
| `pg_replication_origin_session_setup` ( *`node_name`* `text` ) → `void`  Marks the current session as replaying from the given origin, allowing replay progress to be tracked. Can only be used if no origin is currently selected. Use `pg_replication_origin_session_reset` to undo. |
| `pg_replication_origin_session_reset` () → `void`  Cancels the effects of `pg_replication_origin_session_setup()`. |
| `pg_replication_origin_session_is_setup` () → `boolean`  Returns true if a replication origin has been selected in the current session. |
| `pg_replication_origin_session_progress` ( *`flush`* `boolean` ) → `pg_lsn`  Returns the replay location for the replication origin selected in the current session. The parameter *`flush`* determines whether the corresponding local transaction will be guaranteed to have been flushed to disk or not. |
| `pg_replication_origin_xact_setup` ( *`origin_lsn`* `pg_lsn`, *`origin_timestamp`* `timestamp with time zone` ) → `void`  Marks the current transaction as replaying a transaction that has committed at the given LSN and timestamp. Can only be called when a replication origin has been selected using `pg_replication_origin_session_setup`. |
| `pg_replication_origin_xact_reset` () → `void`  Cancels the effects of `pg_replication_origin_xact_setup()`. |
| `pg_replication_origin_advance` ( *`node_name`* `text`, *`lsn`* `pg_lsn` ) → `void`  Sets replication progress for the given node to the given location. This is primarily useful for setting up the initial location, or setting a new location after configuration changes and similar. Be aware that careless use of this function can lead to inconsistently replicated data. |
| `pg_replication_origin_progress` ( *`node_name`* `text`, *`flush`* `boolean` ) → `pg_lsn`  Returns the replay location for the given replication origin. The parameter *`flush`* determines whether the corresponding local transaction will be guaranteed to have been flushed to disk or not. |
| `pg_logical_emit_message` ( *`transactional`* `boolean`, *`prefix`* `text`, *`content`* `text` [, *`flush`* `boolean` `DEFAULT` `false`] ) → `pg_lsn`  `pg_logical_emit_message` ( *`transactional`* `boolean`, *`prefix`* `text`, *`content`* `bytea` [, *`flush`* `boolean` `DEFAULT` `false`] ) → `pg_lsn`  Emits a logical decoding message. This can be used to pass generic messages to logical decoding plugins through WAL. The *`transactional`* parameter specifies if the message should be part of the current transaction, or if it should be written immediately and decoded as soon as the logical decoder reads the record. The *`prefix`* parameter is a textual prefix that can be used by logical decoding plugins to easily recognize messages that are interesting for them. The *`content`* parameter is the content of the message, given either in text or binary form. The *`flush`* parameter (default set to `false`) controls if the message is immediately flushed to WAL or not. *`flush`* has no effect with *`transactional`*, as the message's WAL record is flushed along with its transaction. |
| `pg_sync_replication_slots` () → `void`  Synchronize the logical failover replication slots from the primary server to the standby server. This function can only be executed on the standby server. Temporary synced slots, if any, cannot be used for logical decoding and must be dropped after promotion. See [Section 47.2.3](logicaldecoding-explanation.html#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS-SYNCHRONIZATION "47.2.3. Replication Slot Synchronization") for details. Note that this function cannot be executed if [`sync_replication_slots`](runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-SYNC-REPLICATION-SLOTS) is enabled and the slotsync worker is already running to perform the synchronization of slots. Caution If, after executing the function, [`hot_standby_feedback`](runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-HOT-STANDBY-FEEDBACK) is disabled on the standby or the physical slot configured in [`primary_slot_name`](runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-PRIMARY-SLOT-NAME) is removed, then it is possible that the necessary rows of the synchronized slot will be removed by the VACUUM process on the primary server, resulting in the synchronized slot becoming invalidated. |

### 9.28.7. Database Object Management Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBOBJECT)

The functions shown in [Table 9.100](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE "Table 9.100. Database Object Size Functions") calculate the disk space usage of database objects, or assist in presentation or understanding of usage results. `bigint` results are measured in bytes. If an OID that does not represent an existing object is passed to one of these functions, `NULL` is returned.

**Table 9.100. Database Object Size Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_column_size` ( `"any"` ) → `integer`  Shows the number of bytes used to store any individual data value. If applied directly to a table column value, this reflects any compression that was done. |
| `pg_column_compression` ( `"any"` ) → `text`  Shows the compression algorithm that was used to compress an individual variable-length value. Returns `NULL` if the value is not compressed. |
| `pg_column_toast_chunk_id` ( `"any"` ) → `oid`  Shows the `chunk_id` of an on-disk TOASTed value. Returns `NULL` if the value is un-TOASTed or not on-disk. See [Section 65.2](storage-toast.html "65.2. TOAST") for more information about TOAST. |
| `pg_database_size` ( `name` ) → `bigint`  `pg_database_size` ( `oid` ) → `bigint`  Computes the total disk space used by the database with the specified name or OID. To use this function, you must have `CONNECT` privilege on the specified database (which is granted by default) or have privileges of the `pg_read_all_stats` role. |
| `pg_indexes_size` ( `regclass` ) → `bigint`  Computes the total disk space used by indexes attached to the specified table. |
| `pg_relation_size` ( *`relation`* `regclass` [, *`fork`* `text` ] ) → `bigint`  Computes the disk space used by one “fork” of the specified relation. (Note that for most purposes it is more convenient to use the higher-level functions `pg_total_relation_size` or `pg_table_size`, which sum the sizes of all forks.) With one argument, this returns the size of the main data fork of the relation. The second argument can be provided to specify which fork to examine:   * `main` returns the size of the main data fork of the relation. * `fsm` returns the size of the Free Space Map (see [Section 65.3](storage-fsm.html "65.3. Free Space Map")) associated with the relation. * `vm` returns the size of the Visibility Map (see [Section 65.4](storage-vm.html "65.4. Visibility Map")) associated with the relation. * `init` returns the size of the initialization fork, if any, associated with the relation. |
| `pg_size_bytes` ( `text` ) → `bigint`  Converts a size in human-readable format (as returned by `pg_size_pretty`) into bytes. Valid units are `bytes`, `B`, `kB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`, and `PB`. |
| `pg_size_pretty` ( `bigint` ) → `text`  `pg_size_pretty` ( `numeric` ) → `text`  Converts a size in bytes into a more easily human-readable format with size units (bytes, kB, MB, GB, TB, or PB as appropriate). Note that the units are powers of 2 rather than powers of 10, so 1kB is 1024 bytes, 1MB is 10242 = 1048576 bytes, and so on. |
| `pg_table_size` ( `regclass` ) → `bigint`  Computes the disk space used by the specified table, excluding indexes (but including its TOAST table if any, free space map, and visibility map). |
| `pg_tablespace_size` ( `name` ) → `bigint`  `pg_tablespace_size` ( `oid` ) → `bigint`  Computes the total disk space used in the tablespace with the specified name or OID. To use this function, you must have `CREATE` privilege on the specified tablespace or have privileges of the `pg_read_all_stats` role, unless it is the default tablespace for the current database. |
| `pg_total_relation_size` ( `regclass` ) → `bigint`  Computes the total disk space used by the specified table, including all indexes and TOAST data. The result is equivalent to `pg_table_size` `+` `pg_indexes_size`. |

The functions above that operate on tables or indexes accept a `regclass` argument, which is simply the OID of the table or index in the `pg_class` system catalog. You do not have to look up the OID by hand, however, since the `regclass` data type's input converter will do the work for you. See [Section 8.19](datatype-oid.html "8.19. Object Identifier Types") for details.

The functions shown in [Table 9.101](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBLOCATION "Table 9.101. Database Object Location Functions") assist in identifying the specific disk files associated with database objects.

**Table 9.101. Database Object Location Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_relation_filenode` ( *`relation`* `regclass` ) → `oid`  Returns the “filenode” number currently assigned to the specified relation. The filenode is the base component of the file name(s) used for the relation (see [Section 65.1](storage-file-layout.html "65.1. Database File Layout") for more information). For most relations the result is the same as `pg_class`.`relfilenode`, but for certain system catalogs `relfilenode` is zero and this function must be used to get the correct value. The function returns NULL if passed a relation that does not have storage, such as a view. |
| `pg_relation_filepath` ( *`relation`* `regclass` ) → `text`  Returns the entire file path name (relative to the database cluster's data directory, `PGDATA`) of the relation. |
| `pg_filenode_relation` ( *`tablespace`* `oid`, *`filenode`* `oid` ) → `regclass`  Returns a relation's OID given the tablespace OID and filenode it is stored under. This is essentially the inverse mapping of `pg_relation_filepath`. For a relation in the database's default tablespace, the tablespace can be specified as zero. Returns `NULL` if no relation in the current database is associated with the given values. |

[Table 9.102](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-COLLATION "Table 9.102. Collation Management Functions") lists functions used to manage collations.

**Table 9.102. Collation Management Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_collation_actual_version` ( `oid` ) → `text`  Returns the actual version of the collation object as it is currently installed in the operating system. If this is different from the value in `pg_collation`.`collversion`, then objects depending on the collation might need to be rebuilt. See also [ALTER COLLATION](sql-altercollation.html "ALTER COLLATION"). |
| `pg_database_collation_actual_version` ( `oid` ) → `text`  Returns the actual version of the database's collation as it is currently installed in the operating system. If this is different from the value in `pg_database`.`datcollversion`, then objects depending on the collation might need to be rebuilt. See also [ALTER DATABASE](sql-alterdatabase.html "ALTER DATABASE"). |
| `pg_import_system_collations` ( *`schema`* `regnamespace` ) → `integer`  Adds collations to the system catalog `pg_collation` based on all the locales it finds in the operating system. This is what `initdb` uses; see [Section 23.2.2](collation.html#COLLATION-MANAGING "23.2.2. Managing Collations") for more details. If additional locales are installed into the operating system later on, this function can be run again to add collations for the new locales. Locales that match existing entries in `pg_collation` will be skipped. (But collation objects based on locales that are no longer present in the operating system are not removed by this function.) The *`schema`* parameter would typically be `pg_catalog`, but that is not a requirement; the collations could be installed into some other schema as well. The function returns the number of new collation objects it created. Use of this function is restricted to superusers. |

[Table 9.103](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-PARTITION "Table 9.103. Partitioning Information Functions") lists functions that provide information about the structure of partitioned tables.

**Table 9.103. Partitioning Information Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_partition_tree` ( `regclass` ) → `setof record` ( *`relid`* `regclass`, *`parentrelid`* `regclass`, *`isleaf`* `boolean`, *`level`* `integer` )  Lists the tables or indexes in the partition tree of the given partitioned table or partitioned index, with one row for each partition. Information provided includes the OID of the partition, the OID of its immediate parent, a boolean value telling if the partition is a leaf, and an integer telling its level in the hierarchy. The level value is 0 for the input table or index, 1 for its immediate child partitions, 2 for their partitions, and so on. Returns no rows if the relation does not exist or is not a partition or partitioned table. |
| `pg_partition_ancestors` ( `regclass` ) → `setof regclass`  Lists the ancestor relations of the given partition, including the relation itself. Returns no rows if the relation does not exist or is not a partition or partitioned table. |
| `pg_partition_root` ( `regclass` ) → `regclass`  Returns the top-most parent of the partition tree to which the given relation belongs. Returns `NULL` if the relation does not exist or is not a partition or partitioned table. |

For example, to check the total size of the data contained in a partitioned table `measurement`, one could use the following query:

```

SELECT pg_size_pretty(sum(pg_relation_size(relid))) AS total_size
  FROM pg_partition_tree('measurement');

```

### 9.28.8. Index Maintenance Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-INDEX)

[Table 9.104](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-INDEX-TABLE "Table 9.104. Index Maintenance Functions") shows the functions available for index maintenance tasks. (Note that these maintenance tasks are normally done automatically by autovacuum; use of these functions is only required in special cases.) These functions cannot be executed during recovery. Use of these functions is restricted to superusers and the owner of the given index.

**Table 9.104. Index Maintenance Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `brin_summarize_new_values` ( *`index`* `regclass` ) → `integer`  Scans the specified BRIN index to find page ranges in the base table that are not currently summarized by the index; for any such range it creates a new summary index tuple by scanning those table pages. Returns the number of new page range summaries that were inserted into the index. |
| `brin_summarize_range` ( *`index`* `regclass`, *`blockNumber`* `bigint` ) → `integer`  Summarizes the page range covering the given block, if not already summarized. This is like `brin_summarize_new_values` except that it only processes the page range that covers the given table block number. |
| `brin_desummarize_range` ( *`index`* `regclass`, *`blockNumber`* `bigint` ) → `void`  Removes the BRIN index tuple that summarizes the page range covering the given table block, if there is one. |
| `gin_clean_pending_list` ( *`index`* `regclass` ) → `bigint`  Cleans up the “pending” list of the specified GIN index by moving entries in it, in bulk, to the main GIN data structure. Returns the number of pages removed from the pending list. If the argument is a GIN index built with the `fastupdate` option disabled, no cleanup happens and the result is zero, because the index doesn't have a pending list. See [Section 64.4.4.1](gin.html#GIN-FAST-UPDATE "64.4.4.1. GIN Fast Update Technique") and [Section 64.4.5](gin.html#GIN-TIPS "64.4.5. GIN Tips and Tricks") for details about the pending list and `fastupdate` option. |

### 9.28.9. Generic File Access Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-GENFILE)

The functions shown in [Table 9.105](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-GENFILE-TABLE "Table 9.105. Generic File Access Functions") provide native access to files on the machine hosting the server. Only files within the database cluster directory and the `log_directory` can be accessed, unless the user is a superuser or is granted the role `pg_read_server_files`. Use a relative path for files in the cluster directory, and a path matching the `log_directory` configuration setting for log files.

Note that granting users the EXECUTE privilege on `pg_read_file()`, or related functions, allows them the ability to read any file on the server that the database server process can read; these functions bypass all in-database privilege checks. This means that, for example, a user with such access is able to read the contents of the `pg_authid` table where authentication information is stored, as well as read any table data in the database. Therefore, granting access to these functions should be carefully considered.

When granting privilege on these functions, note that the table entries showing optional parameters are mostly implemented as several physical functions with different parameter lists. Privilege must be granted separately on each such function, if it is to be used. psql's `\df` command can be useful to check what the actual function signatures are.

Some of these functions take an optional *`missing_ok`* parameter, which specifies the behavior when the file or directory does not exist. If `true`, the function returns `NULL` or an empty result set, as appropriate. If `false`, an error is raised. (Failure conditions other than “file not found” are reported as errors in any case.) The default is `false`.

**Table 9.105. Generic File Access Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_ls_dir` ( *`dirname`* `text` [, *`missing_ok`* `boolean`, *`include_dot_dirs`* `boolean` ] ) → `setof text`  Returns the names of all files (and directories and other special files) in the specified directory. The *`include_dot_dirs`* parameter indicates whether “.” and “..” are to be included in the result set; the default is to exclude them. Including them can be useful when *`missing_ok`* is `true`, to distinguish an empty directory from a non-existent directory.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_logdir` () → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's log directory. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and roles with privileges of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_waldir` () → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's write-ahead log (WAL) directory. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and roles with privileges of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_logicalmapdir` () → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's `pg_logical/mappings` directory. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and members of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_logicalsnapdir` () → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's `pg_logical/snapshots` directory. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and members of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_replslotdir` ( *`slot_name`* `text` ) → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's `pg_replslot/slot_name` directory, where *`slot_name`* is the name of the replication slot provided as input of the function. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and members of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_archive_statusdir` () → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the server's WAL archive status directory (`pg_wal/archive_status`). Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and members of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_ls_tmpdir` ( [ *`tablespace`* `oid` ] ) → `setof record` ( *`name`* `text`, *`size`* `bigint`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone` )  Returns the name, size, and last modification time (mtime) of each ordinary file in the temporary file directory for the specified *`tablespace`*. If *`tablespace`* is not provided, the `pg_default` tablespace is examined. Filenames beginning with a dot, directories, and other special files are excluded.  This function is restricted to superusers and members of the `pg_monitor` role by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_read_file` ( *`filename`* `text` [, *`offset`* `bigint`, *`length`* `bigint` ] [, *`missing_ok`* `boolean` ] ) → `text`  Returns all or part of a text file, starting at the given byte *`offset`*, returning at most *`length`* bytes (less if the end of file is reached first). If *`offset`* is negative, it is relative to the end of the file. If *`offset`* and *`length`* are omitted, the entire file is returned. The bytes read from the file are interpreted as a string in the database's encoding; an error is thrown if they are not valid in that encoding.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |
| `pg_read_binary_file` ( *`filename`* `text` [, *`offset`* `bigint`, *`length`* `bigint` ] [, *`missing_ok`* `boolean` ] ) → `bytea`  Returns all or part of a file. This function is identical to `pg_read_file` except that it can read arbitrary binary data, returning the result as `bytea` not `text`; accordingly, no encoding checks are performed.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.  In combination with the `convert_from` function, this function can be used to read a text file in a specified encoding and convert to the database's encoding:  ```  SELECT convert_from(pg_read_binary_file('file_in_utf8.txt'), 'UTF8');  ``` |
| `pg_stat_file` ( *`filename`* `text` [, *`missing_ok`* `boolean` ] ) → `record` ( *`size`* `bigint`, *`access`* `timestamp with time zone`, *`modification`* `timestamp with time zone`, *`change`* `timestamp with time zone`, *`creation`* `timestamp with time zone`, *`isdir`* `boolean` )  Returns a record containing the file's size, last access time stamp, last modification time stamp, last file status change time stamp (Unix platforms only), file creation time stamp (Windows only), and a flag indicating if it is a directory.  This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function. |

### 9.28.10. Advisory Lock Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS)

The functions shown in [Table 9.106](functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS-TABLE "Table 9.106. Advisory Lock Functions") manage advisory locks. For details about proper use of these functions, see [Section 13.3.5](explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS "13.3.5. Advisory Locks").

All these functions are intended to be used to lock application-defined resources, which can be identified either by a single 64-bit key value or two 32-bit key values (note that these two key spaces do not overlap). If another session already holds a conflicting lock on the same resource identifier, the functions will either wait until the resource becomes available, or return a `false` result, as appropriate for the function. Locks can be either shared or exclusive: a shared lock does not conflict with other shared locks on the same resource, only with exclusive locks. Locks can be taken at session level (so that they are held until released or the session ends) or at transaction level (so that they are held until the current transaction ends; there is no provision for manual release). Multiple session-level lock requests stack, so that if the same resource identifier is locked three times there must then be three unlock requests to release the resource in advance of session end.

**Table 9.106. Advisory Lock Functions**

| Function  Description |
| --- |
| `pg_advisory_lock` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `void`  `pg_advisory_lock` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `void`  Obtains an exclusive session-level advisory lock, waiting if necessary. |
| `pg_advisory_lock_shared` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `void`  `pg_advisory_lock_shared` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `void`  Obtains a shared session-level advisory lock, waiting if necessary. |
| `pg_advisory_unlock` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_advisory_unlock` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Releases a previously-acquired exclusive session-level advisory lock. Returns `true` if the lock is successfully released. If the lock was not held, `false` is returned, and in addition, an SQL warning will be reported by the server. |
| `pg_advisory_unlock_all` () → `void`  Releases all session-level advisory locks held by the current session. (This function is implicitly invoked at session end, even if the client disconnects ungracefully.) |
| `pg_advisory_unlock_shared` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_advisory_unlock_shared` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Releases a previously-acquired shared session-level advisory lock. Returns `true` if the lock is successfully released. If the lock was not held, `false` is returned, and in addition, an SQL warning will be reported by the server. |
| `pg_advisory_xact_lock` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `void`  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `void`  Obtains an exclusive transaction-level advisory lock, waiting if necessary. |
| `pg_advisory_xact_lock_shared` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `void`  `pg_advisory_xact_lock_shared` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `void`  Obtains a shared transaction-level advisory lock, waiting if necessary. |
| `pg_try_advisory_lock` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_try_advisory_lock` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Obtains an exclusive session-level advisory lock if available. This will either obtain the lock immediately and return `true`, or return `false` without waiting if the lock cannot be acquired immediately. |
| `pg_try_advisory_lock_shared` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_try_advisory_lock_shared` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Obtains a shared session-level advisory lock if available. This will either obtain the lock immediately and return `true`, or return `false` without waiting if the lock cannot be acquired immediately. |
| `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Obtains an exclusive transaction-level advisory lock if available. This will either obtain the lock immediately and return `true`, or return `false` without waiting if the lock cannot be acquired immediately. |
| `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock_shared` ( *`key`* `bigint` ) → `boolean`  `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock_shared` ( *`key1`* `integer`, *`key2`* `integer` ) → `boolean`  Obtains a shared transaction-level advisory lock if available.

### **[ankane](/ankane)** commented [Jan 5, 2023](#issue-1520139028)

| PgHero can expose data to users through the EXPLAIN feature. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2023-22626](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vf99-xw26-86g5 "CVE-2023-22626").  Versions Affected: 0.1.1 to 3.0.1 Fixed Versions: 3.1.0 Impact A malicious PgHero user can use the EXPLAIN functionality to extract data from the database. With certain inputs, a user can get the results of a query to appear in an error message. If the PgHero database user has superuser privileges (not recommended), the user can use [file access functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-GENFILE) to read files on the database server. Mitigation All users running an affected version should upgrade when possible.  See [#438](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/issues/438) for related EXPLAIN security considerations and changes in this release. Credit Thanks to Seryun Ham of <https://horangi.com> ([blog](https://b3cl4ssy.tistory.com)) for reporting this. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
