- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server application allocates memory for each client connection but fails to free it after the client disconnects. Specifically, the `serve_client` function allocates memory for a `packet` struct using `malloc` but never calls `free` on it, resulting in a memory leak. Also a memory leak occurs in `client_info_alloc` function which is called in main function.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated connections and disconnections from clients will cause the server to eventually run out of memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can repeatedly connect to the server and immediately disconnect to trigger the memory leak, eventually causing the server to crash due to memory exhaustion.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the server. No special privileges are required.
