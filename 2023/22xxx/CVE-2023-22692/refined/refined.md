- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Name Directory plugin for WordPress versions 1.27.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability. This allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to execute actions that the user did not intend to perform. This can have various impacts depending on the actions the attacker can trigger.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through a crafted request to the vulnerable website while the victim user is authenticated on the same site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link. The attacker doesn't require any authentication on the target website.
