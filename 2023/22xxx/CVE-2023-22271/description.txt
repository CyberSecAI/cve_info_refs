Experience Manager versions 6.5.15.0 (and earlier) are affected by a Weak Cryptography for Passwords vulnerability that can lead to a security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker can exploit this in order to decrypt a user's password. The attack complexity is high since a successful exploitation requires to already have in possession this encrypted secret.
