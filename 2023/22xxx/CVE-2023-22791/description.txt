A vulnerability exists in Aruba InstantOS and ArubaOS 10 where an edge-case combination of network configuration, a specific WLAN environment and an attacker already possessing valid user credentials on that WLAN can lead to sensitive information being disclosed via the WLAN. The scenarios in which this disclosure of potentially sensitive information can occur are complex and depend on factors that are beyond the control of the attacker.
