In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the ‘map’ search processing language (SPL) command lets a search bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands. The vulnerability requires a higher privileged user to initiate a request within their browser and only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled.
