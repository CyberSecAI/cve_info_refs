  "CVE-2023-22652": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_file` function of openSUSE libeconf. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking within the strchr function when searching for comment characters in a string. If the pointer `p` goes outside the bounds of buffer, assigning `*(p + 1) = '\\0'` creates a stack overflow vulnerability.  A similar vulnerability exists in the `econf_writeFile` function. If the length of `key_file->file_entry[i].comment_before_key` is greater than or equal to the size of buf, then strncpy will not add null character at the end of `buf`. This may result in `strsep` function not correctly identifying end position of the string when splitting it, thus causing a buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, and potentially remote code execution by attackers providing malformed input files.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local, requiring a user to interact with a program that parses configuration files using a vulnerable libeconf library. It could also be a network attack where a program parses a remote configuration file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide crafted configuration files that trigger the vulnerability in `read_file` or `econf_writeFile` functions. In the local attack scenario, a local user with the ability to use applications using the vulnerable library could trigger the vulnerability, whereas for the network case, the application would need to parse the configuration file from a remote source.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libeconf library before version 0.5.2"
     ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper bounds checking when using `strchr` in the `read_file` function and when using `strncpy` and `strsep` in `econf_writeFile`"
