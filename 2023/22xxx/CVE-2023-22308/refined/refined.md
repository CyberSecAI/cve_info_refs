The provided content is related to CVE-2023-22308.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow in the `OvsProcessData` function within the SoftEther VPN server. Specifically, the `payload_size` is read from the packet and used in a later memory read operation. The calculation of `packet_size` does not prevent an attacker from providing a large `payload_size`, which causes the read operation to read out of bounds of the allocated buffer. This buffer is allocated on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Underflow: The `payload_size` value is read from the packet, and if it is large enough, the subsequent read from the stack buffer goes out of bounds.
- Lack of Bounds Checking: The code does not properly validate the `payload_size` against the actual size of the buffer.
- Stack Buffer Overflow: The out-of-bounds read causes the read to extend past the end of the stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the `vpnserver` process due to a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service. This occurs when reading out of bounds of the allocated buffer on the thread's stack, eventually causing it to hit the guard page and crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Packet: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the SoftEther VPN server. The packet is crafted to bypass initial checks and provide a large size for the OpenVPN payload, resulting in out-of-bounds access during the `Clone` operation.
- TCP Connection: The vulnerability is present in the TCP processing of OpenVPN connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the SoftEther VPN server.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
