- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fbwifi_forward.cgi` CGI program of some firewall versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `fbwifi_forward.cgi` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, with the Facebook WiFi function enabled. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
