- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The REST API did not properly check user permissions based on contact groups when accessing host configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control leading to unauthorized information disclosure. Specifically, a user could read a host's configuration via the API even if they were not in the host's contact group.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive host configuration data.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a GET request to the `/objects/host_config/<host_name>` REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be a valid user with access to the Checkmk instance, but not necessarily a member of the specific host's contact group.
