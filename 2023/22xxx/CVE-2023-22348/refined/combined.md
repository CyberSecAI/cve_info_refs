| Date | Apr 21, 2023 |
| Level | Trivial Change |
| Class | Security Fix |
| Compatibility | Compatible - no manual interaction needed |
| Checkmk versions & editions | | 2.3.0b1 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk Cloud (CCE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | | --- | --- | | 2.2.0b8 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk Cloud (CCE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | | 2.1.0p28 | Checkmk Raw (CRE), Checkmk Enterprise (CEE), Checkmk MSP (CME) | |

Prior to this Werk it was possible for a user to read a hosts configuration
(using GET on `/objects/host_config/<host_name>`) even if that user was not
in the contact group of that host.

The REST-API will correctly check a users permissions before serving a response
in that case and report a 403 error if the user cannot access the host's config.

\* 2.2.0 (beta)
