   - It requires a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page or click a crafted link.
   - The attacker would need to entice the user to perform a specific action that they want to trigger in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to host or provide a malicious web page or crafted link.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated with the application to exploit this vulnerability, they need to rely on the user's authenticated session.
   - The attacker does not require any elevated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
