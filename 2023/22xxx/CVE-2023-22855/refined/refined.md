  "CVE-2023-22855": {
    "description": "The .NET based software spawns a web interface listening on port 8088. The user controllable path is handed to a path concatenation function (`Path.Combine`) without proper sanitization. This yields the possibility to include local files, as well as remote files (SMB). The path is used in a function called `getFile`. The .Net function `Path.Combine` is able to concatenate remote targets.  Depending on the MIME type the content is either sent through a import/export procedure or rendered as `mono/t4` template. The function `getMimeType` will return `t4` if the included file is ending with an extension of `.t4`. The `mono/t4` templating engine allows the use of `C#` to evaluate code. This enables an attacker to gain code execution and eventually spawn a reverse shell.",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing file paths using the `Path.Combine` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Control of Generation of Code (CWE-94)",
      "File Inclusion",
       "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server, allowing an attacker to spawn a reverse shell and potentially gain full control of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The software has a web interface listening on port 8088.",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request including a malicious file path, either local or remote(SMB).",
      "The included file, when ending with .t4, will be interpreted as a template, leading to C# code execution."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service on port 8088",
      "Ability to host a SMB share and make it accessible to the vulnerable server."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable application is based on the .NET framework. The `Path.Combine` function does not sanitize remote paths, allowing for SMB share inclusion. The `mono/t4` templating engine executes C# code embedded in .t4 files, allowing for RCE."
