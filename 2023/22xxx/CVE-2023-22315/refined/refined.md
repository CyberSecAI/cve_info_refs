**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Snap One Wattbox WB-300-IP-3 uses a proprietary local area network (LAN) protocol that does not verify updates to the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345). The device does not properly verify the authenticity of update files.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could upload a malformed update file to the device and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a compromise of the device's functionality or integrity.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to be on the local area network (LAN) to send a malicious update to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the local area network where the device is connected and must be able to send commands using the device's proprietary LAN protocol. The attacker does not require any privileges to exploit this vulnerability, but there are other vulnerabilities that can be used for privilege escalation.
