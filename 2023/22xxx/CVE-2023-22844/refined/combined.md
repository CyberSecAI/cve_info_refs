# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1700

## Milesight MilesightVPN requestHandlers.js verifyToken authentication bypass vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-22844

##### SUMMARY

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the requestHandlers.js verifyToken functionality of Milesight VPN v2.0.2. A specially-crafted network request can lead to authentication bypass. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight VPN v2.0.2

##### PRODUCT URLS

MilesightVPN - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/milesightvpn/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.3 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

##### CWE

CWE-321 - Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

##### DETAILS

The MilesightVPN is software that make the process easier of setting up the VPN tunnel for Milesight products, as well as allows monitoring the connection status with a web server interface.

The MilesightVPN allows to manages the various VPN related configuration and the connected devices through its web interface. The web interface is protected by a login, the web interface verify if the user has the permission to access the webpage through a JSON Web Token.

The function to generate the JWT is `generateToken`:

```
function generateToken(data){
    var created=Math.floor(Date.now()/1000);
    var cert=fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname,'./https/privkey.pem'));
    var token=jwt.sign({
        data,
        exp:created+expiretime
    },cert,{algorithm:'RS256'});
    return token;
}

```

And the function to verify the JWT is `verifyToken`:

```
function verifyToken(token){
    var rt={};
    var cert=fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname,'./https/public.pem'));
    try{
        var result=jwt.verify(token,cert,{algorithm:['RS256']})||{};
        var exp=result.exp?result.exp:0,current=Math.floor(Date.now()/1000);
        if(current<=exp)
        {
            rt=result.data||{};
        }
    }
    catch(e){
    }
    return rt;
}

```

Because the public and private key used for these processes are not generated randomly during the installation of the MilesightVPN but, instead, are static in the installation folder, this make forging a JWT a trivial task, for this reason the web interface is vulnerable to an authentication bypass due to the possibilities of forging valid JWT.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Since the maintainer of this software did not release a patch during the 90 day window specified in our policy, we have now decided to release the information regarding this vulnerability, to make users of the software aware of this problem.
