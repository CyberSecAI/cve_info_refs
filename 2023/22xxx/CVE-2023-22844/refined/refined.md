- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MilesightVPN software uses static, hardcoded public and private keys for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). These keys are not randomly generated during installation and are stored within the installation folder, making it easy for an attacker to obtain them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Use of hardcoded cryptographic keys (CWE-321)
  - Authentication bypass vulnerability in the `verifyToken` function of `requestHandlers.js`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can forge a valid JWT by using the static private key and bypass the web interface's authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the MilesightVPN web interface.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A specially crafted network request containing a forged JWT.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the MilesightVPN web server. They also need to be able to obtain the static private key used by the software, which can be found in the installation directory.
