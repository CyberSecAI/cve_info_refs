# pg\_ivm

The `pg_ivm` module provides Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) feature for PostgreSQL.

The extension is compatible with PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

## Description

**Incremental View Maintenance (IVM)** is a way to make materialized views up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on views rather than recomputing the contents from scratch as `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` does. IVM can update materialized views more efficiently than recomputation when only small parts of the view are changed.

There are two approaches with regard to timing of view maintenance: immediate and deferred. In immediate maintenance, views are updated in the same transaction that its base table is modified. In deferred maintenance, views are updated after the transaction is committed, for example, when the view is accessed, as a response to user command like `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, or periodically in background, and so on. `pg_ivm` provides a kind of immediate maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately in AFTER triggers when a base table is modified.

We call a materialized view supporting IVM an **Incrementally Maintainable Materialized View (IMMV)**. To create IMMV, you have to call `create_immv` function with a relation name and a view definition query. For example:

```
SELECT create_immv('myview', 'SELECT * FROM mytab');
```

creates an IMMV with name 'myview' defined as `SELECT * FROM mytab`. This is corresponding to the following command to create a normal materialized view;

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab;
```

When an IMMV is created, some triggers are automatically created so that the view's contents are immediately updated when its base tables are modified.

```
postgres=# SELECT create_immv('m', 'SELECT * FROM t0');
NOTICE:  could not create an index on immv "m" automatically
DETAIL:  This target list does not have all the primary key columns, or this view does not contain DISTINCT clause.
HINT:  Create an index on the immv for efficient incremental maintenance.
 create_immv
-------------
           3
(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM m;
 i

 3
(3 rows)

postgres=# INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (4);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# SELECT * FROM m; -- automatically updated
 i
---
 1
 2
 3
 4
(4 rows)
```

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, during automatic maintenance of an IMMV, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

## Installation

To install `pg_ivm`, execute this in the module's directory:

```
make install
```

If you installed PostgreSQL from rpm or deb, you will need the devel package (for example, postgresql14-devel or postgresql-server-dev-14).

> **Important:** Don't forget to set the `PG_CONFIG` variable (`make PG_CONFIG=...`) or the `PATH` to the `pg_config` command in case you want to use `pg_ivm` on a non-default or custom build of PostgreSQL. Read more [here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Building_and_Installing_PostgreSQL_Extension_Modules).

And, execute CREATE EXTENSION comand.

```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ivm;

```

### RPM packages and yum repository

RPM packages of pg\_ivm are available from the [PostgreSQL yum repository](https://yum.postgresql.org/). See the [instruction](https://yum.postgresql.org/howto/) for details. Note that we are not the maintainer of this yum repository and RPMs for pg\_ivm in it may be not always latest.

## Objects

When `pg_ivm` is installed, the following objects are created.

### Functions

#### create\_immv

Use `create_immv` function to create IMMV.

```
create_immv(immv_name text, view_definition text) RETURNS bigint

```

`create_immv` defines a new IMMV of a query. A table of the name `immv_name` is created and a query specified by `view_definition` is executed and used to populate the IMMV. The query is stored in `pg_ivm_immv`, so that it can be refreshed later upon incremental view maintenance. `create_immv` returns the number of rows in the created IMMV.

When an IMMV is created, some triggers are automatically created so that the view's contents are immediately updated when its base tables are modified. In addition, a unique index is created on the IMMV automatically if possible. If the view definition query has a GROUP BY clause, a unique index is created on the columns of GROUP BY expressions. Also, if the view has DISTINCT clause, a unique index is created on all columns in the target list. Otherwise, if the IMMV contains all primary key attributes of its base tables in the target list, a unique index is created on these attributes. In other cases, no index is created.

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, while `create_immv` is running, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

#### refresh\_immv

Use `refresh_immv` function to refresh IMMV.

```
refresh_immv(immv_name text, with_data bool) RETURNS bigint

```

`refresh_immv` completely replaces the contents of an IMMV as `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command does for a materialized view. To execute this function you must be the owner of the IMMV (with PostgreSQL 16 or earlier) or have the `MAINTAIN` privilege on the IMMV (with PostgreSQL 17 or later). The old contents are discarded.

The with\_data flag is corresponding to `WITH [NO] DATA` option of REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. If with\_data is true, the backing query is executed to provide the new data, and if the IMMV is unpopulated, triggers for maintaining the view are created. Also, a unique index is created for IMMV if it is possible and the view doesn't have that yet. If with\_data is false, no new data is generated and the IMMV become unpopulated, and the triggers are dropped from the IMMV. Note that unpopulated IMMV is still scannable although the result is empty. This behaviour may be changed in future to raise an error when an unpopulated IMMV is scanned.

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, while `refresh_immv` is running, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

#### get\_immv\_def

`get_immv_def` reconstructs the underlying SELECT command for an IMMV. (This is a decompiled reconstruction, not the original text of the command.)

```
get_immv_def(immv regclass) RETURNS text

```

### IMMV metadata catalog

The catalog `pg_ivm_immv` stores IMMV information.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| immvrelid | regclass | The OID of the IMMV |
| viewdef | text | Query tree (in the form of a nodeToString() representation) for the view definition |
| ispopulated | bool | True if IMMV is currently populated |

## Example

In general, IMMVs allow faster updates than `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` at the price of slower updates to their base tables. Update of base tables is slower because triggers will be invoked and the IMMV is updated in triggers per modification statement.

For example, suppose a normal materialized view defined as below:

```
test=# CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_normal AS
        SELECT a.aid, b.bid, a.abalance, b.bbalance
        FROM pgbench_accounts a JOIN pgbench_branches b USING(bid);
SELECT 10000000
```

Updating a tuple in a base table of this materialized view is rapid but the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command on this view takes a long time:

```
test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 1000 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 9.052 ms

test=# REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_normal ;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
Time: 20575.721 ms (00:20.576)
```

On the other hand, after creating IMMV with the same view definition as below:

```
test=# SELECT create_immv('immv',
        'SELECT a.aid, b.bid, a.abalance, b.bbalance
         FROM pgbench_accounts a JOIN pgbench_branches b USING(bid)');
NOTICE:  created index "immv_index" on immv "immv"
 create_immv
-------------
    10000000
(1 row)

```

updating a tuple in a base table takes more than the normal view, but its content is updated automatically and this is faster than the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command.

```
test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 1234 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 15.448 ms

test=# SELECT * FROM immv WHERE aid = 1;
 aid | bid | abalance | bbalance
-----+-----+----------+----------
   1 |   1 |     1234 |        0
(1 row)
```

An appropriate index on IMMV is necessary for efficient IVM because we need to looks for tuples to be updated in IMMV. If there are no indexes, it will take a long time.

Therefore, when an IMMV is created by the `create_immv` function, a unique index is created on it automatically if possible. If the view definition query has a GROUP BY clause, a unique index is created on the columns of GROUP BY expressions. Also, if the view has DISTINCT clause, a unique index is created on all columns in the target list. Otherwise, if the IMMV contains all primary key attributes of its base tables in the target list, a unique index is created on these attributes. In other cases, no index is created.

In the previous example, a unique index "immv\_index" is created on aid and bid columns of "immv", and this enables the rapid update of the view. Dropping this index make updating the view take a loger time.

```
test=# DROP INDEX immv_index;
DROP INDEX

test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 9876 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 3224.741 ms (00:03.225)
```

## Supported View Definitions and Restriction

Currently, IMMV's view definition can contain inner joins, DISTINCT clause, some built-in aggregate functions, simple sub-queries in `FROM` clause, EXISTS sub-queries, and simple CTE (`WITH` query). Inner joins including self-join are supported, but outer joins are not supported. Supported aggregate functions are count, sum, avg, min and max. Other aggregates, sub-queries which contain an aggregate or `DISTINCT` clause, sub-queries in other than `FROM` clause, window functions, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`, `DISTINCT ON`, `TABLESAMPLE`, `VALUES`, and `FOR UPDATE`/`SHARE` can not be used in view definition.

The base tables must be simple tables. Views, materialized views, inheritance parent tables, partitioned tables, partitions, and foreign tables can not be used.

Any system column cannot be included in the view definition query.
The target list cannot columns whose name starts with `__ivm_`.

Data type used in the target list in the view must have default operator class for access method btree. For example, `json`, `xml`, or `point` type cannot be in the target list.

Logical replication is not supported, that is, even when a base table at a publisher node is modified, IMMVs at subscriber nodes defined on these base tables are not updated.

## Notes

### Aggregates

Supported aggregate functions are `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, and `max`. Currently, only built-in aggregate functions are supported and user defined aggregates cannot be used.

When an IMMV including aggregate is created, some extra columns whose name start with `__ivm` are automatically added to the target list. `__ivm_count__` contains the number of tuples aggregated in each group. In addition, more than one extra columns for each column of aggregated value are added in order to maintain the value. For example, columns named like `__ivm_count_avg__` and `__ivm_sum_avg__` are added for maintaining an average value. When a base table is modified, the new aggregated values are incrementally calculated using the old aggregated values and values of related extra columns stored in the IMMV.

Note that for `min` or `max`, the new values could be re-calculated from base tables with regard to the affected groups when a tuple containing the current minimal or maximal values are deleted from a base table. Therefore, it can takes a long time to update an IMMV containing these functions.

Also, note that using `sum` or `avg` on `real` (`float4`) type or `double precision` (`float8`) type in IMMV is unsafe, because aggregated values in IMMV can become different from results calculated from base tables due to the limited precision of these types. To avoid this problem, use the `numeric` type instead.

#### Restrictions on Aggregate

If we have a `GROUP BY` clause, expressions specified in `GROUP BY` must appear in the target list. This is how tuples to be updated in the IMMV are identified. These attributes are used as scan keys for searching tuples in the IMMV, so indexes on them are required for efficient IVM.

Targetlist cannot contain expressions which contain an aggregate in it.

### Subqueries

Simple subqueries in `FROM` clause and EXISTS subqueries in 'WHERE' clause are supported.

#### Restrictions on Subqueries

Subqueries using EXISTS and simple subqueries in FROM clause are supported. EXISTS subqueries with condition other than 'AND' and Subqueries in targetlist are not supported. EXISTS subquery is supported only in WHERE but not in the targetlist.

If EXISTS contains columns that refer to columns in tables in the outer query, such columns must be included in the targetlist.
Subqueries containing an aggregate function or `DISTINCT` are not supported.

### CTE

Simple CTEs (`WITH` queries) are supported.

#### Restrictions on CTEs

`WITH` queries containing an aggregate function or `DISTINCT` are not supported.

Recursive queries (`WITH RECURSIVE`) are not allowed. Unreferenced CTEs are not allowed either, that is, a CTE must be referenced at least once in the view definition query.

### DISTINCT

`DISTINCT` is allowed in IMMV's definition queries. Suppose an IMMV defined with DISTINCT on a base table containing duplicate tuples. When tuples are deleted from the base table, a tuple in the view is deleted if and only if the multiplicity of the tuple becomes zero. Moreover, when tuples are inserted into the base table, a tuple is inserted into the view only if the same tuple doesn't already exist in it.

Physically, an IMMV defined with `DISTINCT` contains tuples after eliminating duplicates, and the multiplicity of each tuple is stored in a extra column named `__ivm_count__` that is added when such IMMV is created.

### TRUNCATE

When a base table is truncated, the IMMV is also truncated and the contents become empty if the view definition query does not contain an aggregate without a `GROUP BY` clause. Aggregate views without a `GROUP BY` clause always have one row. Therefore, in such cases, if a base table is truncated, the IMMV is simply refreshed instead of being truncated.

### Concurrent Transactions

Suppose an IMMV is defined on two base tables and each table was modified in different a concurrent transaction simultaneously. In the transaction which was committed first, the IMMV can be updated considering only the change which happened in this transaction. On the other hand, in order to update the IMMV correctly in the transaction which was committed later, we need to know the changes occurred in both transactions. For this reason, `ExclusiveLock` is held on an IMMV immediately after a base table is modified in `READ COMMITTED` mode to make sure that the IMMV is updated in the latter transaction after the former transaction is committed. In `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE` mode, an error is raised immediately if lock acquisition fails because any changes which occurred in other transactions are not be visible in these modes and IMMV cannot be updated correctly in such situations. However, as an exception if the IMMV has only one base table and doesn't use DISTINCT or GROUP BY, and the table is modified by `INSERT`, then the lock held on the IMMV is `RowExclusiveLock`.

### Row Level Security

If some base tables have row level security policy, rows that are not visible to the materialized view's owner are excluded from the result. In addition, such rows are excluded as well when views are incrementally maintained. However, if a new policy is defined or policies are changed after the materialized view was created, the new policy will not be applied to the view contents. To apply the new policy, you need to recreate IMMV.

### How to Disable or Enable Immediate Maintenance

IVM is effective when we want to keep an IMMV up-to-date and small fraction of a base table is modified infrequently. Due to the overhead of immediate maintenance, IVM is not effective when a base table is modified frequently. Also, when a large part of a base table is modified or large data is inserted into a base table, IVM is not effective and the cost of maintenance can be larger than refresh from scratch.

In such situation, we can use `refesh_immv` function with `with_data = false` to disable immediate maintenance before modifying a base table. After a base table modification, call `refresh_immv`with `with_data = true` to refresh the view data and enable immediate maintenance.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Published:2023/03/06  Last Updated:2023/03/06
# JVN#19872280 Multiple vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL extension module pg\_ivm

## Overview

pg\_ivm provided by IVM Development Group contains multiple vulnerabilities.

## Products Affected

* pg\_ivm versions prior to 1.5.1

## Description

pg\_ivm provided by IVM Development Group is a PostgreSQL extension module that provides incremental view maintenance functionality of materialized views. pg\_ivm contains multiple vulnerabilities listed below.

* **Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor ([CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html))** - CVE-2023-22847

  An Incrementally Maintainable Materialized View (IMMV) created by pg\_ivm may reflect rows with Row-Level Security that the owner of the IMMV should not have access to.

  | CVSS v3 | CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N | **Base Score: 4.3** |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | CVSS v2 | AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N | **Base Score: 4.0** |
* **Uncontrolled search path element ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html))** - CVE-2023-23554

  When refreshing an IMMV, pg\_ivm executes functions without specifying schema names. Under certain conditions, pg\_ivm may be tricked to execute unexpected functions from other schemas with the IMMV owner's privilege.

  | CVSS v3 | CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N | **Base Score: 5.4** |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | CVSS v2 | AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N | **Base Score: 5.5** |

## Impact

* Information in tables protected by Row-Level Security may be retrieved by a user who is not authorized to access it - CVE-2023-22847
* An unexpected function provided by an attacker may be executed with the privilege of the materialized view owner - CVE-2023-23554

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

The developer has released pg\_ivm 1.5.1 that addresses the vulnerabilities.

# pg\_ivm

The `pg_ivm` module provides Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) feature for PostgreSQL.

The extension is compatible with PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

## Description

**Incremental View Maintenance (IVM)** is a way to make materialized views up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on views rather than recomputing the contents from scratch as `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` does. IVM can update materialized views more efficiently than recomputation when only small parts of the view are changed.

There are two approaches with regard to timing of view maintenance: immediate and deferred. In immediate maintenance, views are updated in the same transaction that its base table is modified. In deferred maintenance, views are updated after the transaction is committed, for example, when the view is accessed, as a response to user command like `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, or periodically in background, and so on. `pg_ivm` provides a kind of immediate maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately in AFTER triggers when a base table is modified.

We call a materialized view supporting IVM an **Incrementally Maintainable Materialized View (IMMV)**. To create IMMV, you have to call `create_immv` function with a relation name and a view definition query. For example:

```
SELECT create_immv('myview', 'SELECT * FROM mytab');
```

creates an IMMV with name 'myview' defined as `SELECT * FROM mytab`. This is corresponding to the following command to create a normal materialized view;

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab;
```

When an IMMV is created, some triggers are automatically created so that the view's contents are immediately updated when its base tables are modified.

```
postgres=# SELECT create_immv('m', 'SELECT * FROM t0');
NOTICE:  could not create an index on immv "m" automatically
DETAIL:  This target list does not have all the primary key columns, or this view does not contain DISTINCT clause.
HINT:  Create an index on the immv for efficient incremental maintenance.
 create_immv
-------------
           3
(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM m;
 i
---
 1
 2
 3
(3 rows)

postgres=# INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (4);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# SELECT * FROM m; -- automatically updated
 i
---
 1
 2
 3
 4
(4 rows)
```

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, during automatic maintenance of an IMMV, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

## Installation

To install `pg_ivm`, execute this in the module's directory:

```
make install
```

If you installed PostgreSQL from rpm or deb, you will need the devel package (for example, postgresql14-devel or postgresql-server-dev-14).

> **Important:** Don't forget to set the `PG_CONFIG` variable (`make PG_CONFIG=...`) or the `PATH` to the `pg_config` command in case you want to use `pg_ivm` on a non-default or custom build of PostgreSQL. Read more [here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Building_and_Installing_PostgreSQL_Extension_Modules).

And, execute CREATE EXTENSION comand.

```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ivm;

```

### RPM packages and yum repository

RPM packages of pg\_ivm are available from the [PostgreSQL yum repository](https://yum.postgresql.org/). See the [instruction](https://yum.postgresql.org/howto/) for details. Note that we are not the maintainer of this yum repository and RPMs for pg\_ivm in it may be not always latest.

## Objects

When `pg_ivm` is installed, the following objects are created.

### Functions

#### create\_immv

Use `create_immv` function to create IMMV.

```
create_immv(immv_name text, view_definition text) RETURNS bigint

```

`create_immv` defines a new IMMV of a query. A table of the name `immv_name` is created and a query specified by `view_definition` is executed and used to populate the IMMV. The query is stored in `pg_ivm_immv`, so that it can be refreshed later upon incremental view maintenance. `create_immv` returns the number of rows in the created IMMV.

When an IMMV is created, some triggers are automatically created so that the view's contents are immediately updated when its base tables are modified. In addition, a unique index is created on the IMMV automatically if possible. If the view definition query has a GROUP BY clause, a unique index is created on the columns of GROUP BY expressions. Also, if the view has DISTINCT clause, a unique index is created on all columns in the target list. Otherwise, if the IMMV contains all primary key attributes of its base tables in the target list, a unique index is created on these attributes. In other cases, no index is created.

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, while `create_immv` is running, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

#### refresh\_immv

Use `refresh_immv` function to refresh IMMV.

```
refresh_immv(immv_name text, with_data bool) RETURNS bigint

```

`refresh_immv` completely replaces the contents of an IMMV as `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command does for a materialized view. To execute this function you must be the owner of the IMMV (with PostgreSQL 16 or earlier) or have the `MAINTAIN` privilege on the IMMV (with PostgreSQL 17 or later). The old contents are discarded.

The with\_data flag is corresponding to `WITH [NO] DATA` option of REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. If with\_data is true, the backing query is executed to provide the new data, and if the IMMV is unpopulated, triggers for maintaining the view are created. Also, a unique index is created for IMMV if it is possible and the view doesn't have that yet. If with\_data is false, no new data is generated and the IMMV become unpopulated, and the triggers are dropped from the IMMV. Note that unpopulated IMMV is still scannable although the result is empty. This behaviour may be changed in future to raise an error when an unpopulated IMMV is scanned.

Note that if you use PostgreSQL 17 or later, while `refresh_immv` is running, the `search_path` is temporarily changed to `pg_catalog, pg_temp`.

#### get\_immv\_def

`get_immv_def` reconstructs the underlying SELECT command for an IMMV. (This is a decompiled reconstruction, not the original text of the command.)

```
get_immv_def(immv regclass) RETURNS text

```

### IMMV metadata catalog

The catalog `pg_ivm_immv` stores IMMV information.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| immvrelid | regclass | The OID of the IMMV |
| viewdef | text | Query tree (in the form of a nodeToString() representation) for the view definition |
| ispopulated | bool | True if IMMV is currently populated |

## Example

In general, IMMVs allow faster updates than `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` at the price of slower updates to their base tables. Update of base tables is slower because triggers will be invoked and the IMMV is updated in triggers per modification statement.

For example, suppose a normal materialized view defined as below:

```
test=# CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_normal AS
        SELECT a.aid, b.bid, a.abalance, b.bbalance
        FROM pgbench_accounts a JOIN pgbench_branches b USING(bid);
SELECT 10000000
```

Updating a tuple in a base table of this materialized view is rapid but the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command on this view takes a long time:

```
test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 1000 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 9.052 ms

test=# REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_normal ;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
Time: 20575.721 ms (00:20.576)
```

On the other hand, after creating IMMV with the same view definition as below:

```
test=# SELECT create_immv('immv',
        'SELECT a.aid, b.bid, a.abalance, b.bbalance
         FROM pgbench_accounts a JOIN pgbench_branches b USING(bid)');
NOTICE:  created index "immv_index" on immv "immv"
 create_immv
-------------
    10000000
(1 row)

```

updating a tuple in a base table takes more than the normal view, but its content is updated automatically and this is faster than the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command.

```
test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 1234 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 15.448 ms

test=# SELECT * FROM immv WHERE aid = 1;
 aid | bid | abalance | bbalance
-----+-----+----------+----------
   1 |   1 |     1234 |        0
(1 row)
```

An appropriate index on IMMV is necessary for efficient IVM because we need to looks for tuples to be updated in IMMV. If there are no indexes, it will take a long time.

Therefore, when an IMMV is created by the `create_immv` function, a unique index is created on it automatically if possible. If the view definition query has a GROUP BY clause, a unique index is created on the columns of GROUP BY expressions. Also, if the view has DISTINCT clause, a unique index is created on all columns in the target list. Otherwise, if the IMMV contains all primary key attributes of its base tables in the target list, a unique index is created on these attributes. In other cases, no index is created.

In the previous example, a unique index "immv\_index" is created on aid and bid columns of "immv", and this enables the rapid update of the view. Dropping this index make updating the view take a loger time.

```
test=# DROP INDEX immv_index;
DROP INDEX

test=# UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = 9876 WHERE aid = 1;
UPDATE 1
Time: 3224.741 ms (00:03.225)
```

## Supported View Definitions and Restriction

Currently, IMMV's view definition can contain inner joins, DISTINCT clause, some built-in aggregate functions, simple sub-queries in `FROM` clause, EXISTS sub-queries, and simple CTE (`WITH` query). Inner joins including self-join are supported, but outer joins are not supported. Supported aggregate functions are count, sum, avg, min and max. Other aggregates, sub-queries which contain an aggregate or `DISTINCT` clause, sub-queries in other than `FROM` clause, window functions, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`, `DISTINCT ON`, `TABLESAMPLE`, `VALUES`, and `FOR UPDATE`/`SHARE` can not be used in view definition.

The base tables must be simple tables. Views, materialized views, inheritance parent tables, partitioned tables, partitions, and foreign tables can not be used.

Any system column cannot be included in the view definition query.
The target list cannot columns whose name starts with `__ivm_`.

Data type used in the target list in the view must have default operator class for access method btree. For example, `json`, `xml`, or `point` type cannot be in the target list.

Logical replication is not supported, that is, even when a base table at a publisher node is modified, IMMVs at subscriber nodes defined on these base tables are not updated.

## Notes

### Aggregates

Supported aggregate functions are `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, and `max`. Currently, only built-in aggregate functions are supported and user defined aggregates cannot be used.

When an IMMV including aggregate is created, some extra columns whose name start with `__ivm` are automatically added to the target list. `__ivm_count__` contains the number of tuples aggregated in each group. In addition, more than one extra columns for each column of aggregated value are added in order to maintain the value. For example, columns named like `__ivm_count_avg__` and `__ivm_sum_avg__` are added for maintaining an average value. When a base table is modified, the new aggregated values are incrementally calculated using the old aggregated values and values of related extra columns stored in the IMMV.

Note that for `min` or `max`, the new values could be re-calculated from base tables with regard to the affected groups when a tuple containing the current minimal or maximal values are deleted from a base table. Therefore, it can takes a long time to update an IMMV containing these functions.

Also, note that using `sum` or `avg` on `real` (`float4`) type or `double precision` (`float8`) type in IMMV is unsafe, because aggregated values in IMMV can become different from results calculated from base tables due to the limited precision of these types. To avoid this problem, use the `numeric` type instead.

#### Restrictions on Aggregate

If we have a `GROUP BY` clause, expressions specified in `GROUP BY` must appear in the target list. This is how tuples to be updated in the IMMV are identified. These attributes are used as scan keys for searching tuples in the IMMV, so indexes on them are required for efficient IVM.

Targetlist cannot contain expressions which contain an aggregate in it.

### Subqueries

Simple subqueries in `FROM` clause and EXISTS subqueries in 'WHERE' clause are supported.

#### Restrictions on Subqueries

Subqueries using EXISTS and simple subqueries in FROM clause are supported. EXISTS subqueries with condition other than 'AND' and Subqueries in targetlist are not supported. EXISTS subquery is supported only in WHERE but not in the targetlist.

If EXISTS contains columns that refer to columns in tables in the outer query, such columns must be included in the targetlist.
Subqueries containing an aggregate function or `DISTINCT` are not supported.

### CTE

Simple CTEs (`WITH` queries) are supported.

#### Restrictions on CTEs

`WITH` queries containing an aggregate function or `DISTINCT` are not supported.

Recursive queries (`WITH RECURSIVE`) are not allowed. Unreferenced CTEs are not allowed either, that is, a CTE must be referenced at least once in the view definition query.

### DISTINCT

`DISTINCT` is allowed in IMMV's definition queries. Suppose an IMMV defined with DISTINCT on a base table containing duplicate tuples. When tuples are deleted from the base table, a tuple in the view is deleted if and only if the multiplicity of the tuple becomes zero. Moreover, when tuples are inserted into the base table, a tuple is inserted into the view only if the same tuple doesn't already exist in it.

Physically, an IMMV defined with `DISTINCT` contains tuples after eliminating duplicates, and the multiplicity of each tuple is stored in a extra column named `__ivm_count__` that is added when such IMMV is created.

### TRUNCATE

When a base table is truncated, the IMMV is also truncated and the contents become empty if the view definition query does not contain an aggregate without a `GROUP BY` clause. Aggregate views without a `GROUP BY` clause always have one row. Therefore, in such cases, if a base table is truncated, the IMMV is simply refreshed instead of being truncated.

### Concurrent Transactions

Suppose an IMMV is defined on two base tables and each table was modified in different a concurrent transaction simultaneously. In the transaction which was committed first, the IMMV can be updated considering only the change which happened in this transaction. On the other hand, in order to update the IMMV correctly in the transaction which was committed later, we need to know the changes occurred in both transactions. For this reason, `ExclusiveLock` is held on an IMMV immediately after a base table is modified in `READ COMMITTED` mode to make sure that the IMMV is updated in the latter transaction after the former transaction is committed. In `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE` mode, an error is raised immediately if lock acquisition fails because any changes which occurred in other transactions are not be visible in these modes and IMMV cannot be updated correctly in such situations. However, as an exception if the IMMV has only one base table and doesn't use DISTINCT or GROUP BY, and the table is modified by `INSERT`, then the lock held on the IMMV is `RowExclusiveLock`.

### Row Level Security

If some base tables have row level security policy, rows that are not visible to the materialized view's owner are excluded from the result. In addition, such rows are excluded as well when views are incrementally maintained. However, if a new policy is defined or policies are changed after the materialized view was created, the new policy will not be applied to the view contents. To apply the new policy, you need to recreate IMMV.

### How to Disable or Enable Immediate Maintenance

IVM is effective when we want to keep an IMMV up-to-date and small fraction of a base table is modified infrequently. Due to the overhead of immediate maintenance, IVM is not effective when a base table is modified frequently. Also, when a large part of a base table is modified or large data is inserted into a base table, IVM is not effective and the cost of maintenance can be larger than refresh from scratch.

In such situation, we can use `refesh_immv` function with `with_data = false` to disable immediate maintenance before modifying a base table. After a base table modification, call `refresh_immv`with `with_data = true` to refresh the view data and enable immediate maintenance.

[v1.5.1](/sraoss/pg_ivm/tree/v1.5.1)

[`a81c657`](/sraoss/pg_ivm/commit/a81c657223261ecb565036020eeb8ffacfe938ea)

This release contains security fixes.

* Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200) - [CVE-2023-22847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22847)

  An Incrementally Maintainable Materialized View (IMMV) created by pg\_ivm may reflect rows with Row-Level Security that the owner of the IMMV should not have access to.
* Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427) - [CVE-2023-23554](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23554)

  When refreshing an IMMV, pg\_ivm executes functions without specifying schema names. Under certain conditions, pg\_ivm may be tricked to execute unexpected functions from other schemas with the IMMV owner's privilege.

### Bug fixes

* Fix row level security checks during view maintenance by [@yugo-n](https://github.com/yugo-n) ([CVE-2023-22847](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw2m-6h7m-p859 "CVE-2023-22847"))

  The view maintenance is performed under the view owner privilege. If a modified table has a (Row Level Security) RLS policy, rows in that table must be accessed by the privilege of the IMMV owner during view maintenance, so rows invisible to the view owner must not appear in the IMMV. However, the security check was not properly handled, and rows that must not be accessed from the view owner could appear in the view contents when the view was refreshed incrementally during a query that contains multiple types of commands, like a modifying CTE that contains INSERT and UPDATE, or a MERGE command.
* Fix to use qualified function names during maintenance by [@yugo-n](https://github.com/yugo-n) ([CVE-2023-23554](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwqx-q9h3-4q35 "CVE-2023-23554"))

  Previously, functions names in pg\_catalog schema that were used during view maintenance were not qualified. This is problematic because functions in other schema could be referenced unintentionally. Moreover, that could result in privilege escalation that if a nefarious user who can create a function, arbitrary functions could be executed under IMMV owner's privilege.
* Rebuild the query for recalculating min/max after search\_path change by [@yugo-n](https://github.com/yugo-n) ([CVE-2023-23554](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwqx-q9h3-4q35 "CVE-2023-23554"))

  Cached plans for recalculating min/max values are built from the view definition query text. Therefore, when the search\_path was changed, the query text was analyzed again, and tables or functions in a wrong schema could be referenced in the plan. This is fixed so that, after search\_path is changed, a plan is rebuilt from a new query string where table / function names are properly qualified under the latest search\_path are used.
