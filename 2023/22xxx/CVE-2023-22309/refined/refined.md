- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper sanitization of URL parameter keys, allowing injection of malicious HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code into the user's browser via a crafted URL, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious links to unsuspecting users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the malicious script and entice the victim to click it, which requires no specific access to the system.
