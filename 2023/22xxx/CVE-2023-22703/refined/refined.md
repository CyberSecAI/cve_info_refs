- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WCP Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the contact form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker is required, and no special position is needed other than being able to interact with the contact form.
