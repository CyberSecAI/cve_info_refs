## pgAdmin CI/CD

*Author: Dave Page, date: Aug. 24, 2023*

Almost exactly three years ago I wrote a blog on my personal page entitled Testing pgAdmin which went into great detail discussing how we test pgAdmin prior to releases. Back then, all of the automated testing was performed using Jenkins, with a number of jobs that ran various test suites whenever new code was checked in. All of this infrastructure ran in a virtual private cloud on AWS consisting of a large number of virtual machines and other resources, hosted for the project by EDB.
I recently undertook a project to move the testing infrastructure to our Github project, using Github Actions.

| Currently, when pgAdmin is running in server mode and user opens the pgAdmin URL, it opens login page with redirect URL to /browser of pgAdmin using `next` param. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to redirect victims to arbitrary URL. |

# pgAdmin 4

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (<http://www.postgresql.org>) database.

In the following documentation and examples, *$PGADMIN4\_SRC/* is used to denote
the top-level directory of a copy of the pgAdmin source tree, either from a
tarball or a git checkout.

## Architecture

pgAdmin 4 is written as a web application with Python(Flask) on the server side
and ReactJS, HTML5 with CSS for the client side processing and UI.

Although developed using web technologies, pgAdmin 4 can be deployed either on
a web server using a browser, or standalone on a workstation. The runtime/
subdirectory contains an Electron based runtime application intended to allow this,
which will execute the Python server and display the UI.

## Building the Runtime

To build the runtime, the following packages must be installed:

* NodeJS 16+
* Yarn

Change into the runtime directory, and run *yarn install*. This will install the
dependencies required.

In order to use the runtime in a development environment, you'll need to copy
*dev\_config.json.in* file to *dev\_config.json*, and edit the paths to the Python
executable and *pgAdmin.py* file, otherwise the runtime will use the default
paths it would expect to find in the standard package for your platform.

You can then execute the runtime by running something like:

```
yarn run start
```

# Configuring the Python Environment

In order to run the Python code, a suitable runtime environment is required.
Python version 3.7 and later are currently supported. It is recommended that a
Python Virtual Environment is setup for this purpose, rather than using the
system Python environment. On Linux and Mac systems, the process is fairly
simple - adapt as required for your distribution:

1. Create a virtual environment in an appropriate directory. The last argument is
   the name of the environment; that can be changed as desired:

   ```
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   ```
2. Now activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Some of the components used by pgAdmin require a very recent version of *pip*,
   so update that to the latest:

   ```
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
4. Ensure that a PostgreSQL installation's bin/ directory is in the path (so
   pg\_config can be found for building psycopg3), and install the required
   packages:

   ```
   (venv) $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin pip install -r $PGADMIN4_SRC/requirements.txt
   ```

   If you are planning to run the regression tests, you also need to install
   additional requirements from web/regression/requirements.txt:

   ```
   (venv) $ pip install -r $PGADMIN4_SRC/web/regression/requirements.txt
   ```
5. Create a local configuration file for pgAdmin. Edit
   $PGADMIN4\_SRC/web/config\_local.py and add any desired configuration options
   (use the config.py file as a reference - any settings duplicated in
   config\_local.py will override those in config.py). A typical development
   configuration may look like:

   ```
   from config import *

   # Debug mode
   DEBUG = True

   # App mode
   SERVER_MODE = True

   # Enable the test module
   MODULE_BLACKLIST.remove('test')

   # Log
   CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL = DEBUG
   FILE_LOG_LEVEL = DEBUG

   DEFAULT_SERVER = '127.0.0.1'

   UPGRADE_CHECK_ENABLED = True

   # Use a different config DB for each server mode.
   if SERVER_MODE == False:
       SQLITE_PATH = os.path.join(
           DATA_DIR,
           'pgadmin4-desktop.db'
       )
   else:
       SQLITE_PATH = os.path.join(
           DATA_DIR,
           'pgadmin4-server.db'
       )
   ```

   This configuration allows easy switching between server and desktop modes
   for testing.
6. The initial setup of the configuration database is interactive in server
   mode, and non-interactive in desktop mode. You can run it either by
   running:

   ```
   (venv) $ python3 $PGADMIN4_SRC/web/setup.py
   ```

   or by starting pgAdmin 4:

   ```
   (venv) $ python3 $PGADMIN4_SRC/web/pgAdmin4.py
   ```

   Whilst it is possible to automatically run setup in desktop mode by running
   the runtime, that will not work in server mode as the runtime doesn't allow
   command line interaction with the setup program.

At this point you will be able to run pgAdmin 4 from the command line in either
server or desktop mode, and access it from a web browser using the URL shown in
the terminal once pgAdmin has started up.

Setup of an environment on Windows is somewhat more complicated unfortunately,
please see *pkg/win32/README.txt* for complete details.

# Building the Web Assets

pgAdmin is dependent on a number of third party Javascript libraries. These,
along with it's own Javascript code, SCSS/CSS code and images must be
compiled into a "bundle" which is transferred to the browser for execution
and rendering. This is far more efficient than simply requesting each
asset as it's needed by the client.

To create the bundle, you will need the 'yarn' package management tool to be
installed. Then, you can run the following commands on a \*nix system to
download the required packages and build the bundle:

```
(venv) $ cd $PGADMIN4_SRC
(venv) $ make install-node
(venv) $ make bundle
```

On Windows systems (where "make" is not available), the following commands
can be used:

```
C:\> cd $PGADMIN4_SRC\web
C:\$PGADMIN4_SRC\web> yarn install
C:\$PGADMIN4_SRC\web> yarn run bundle

```

# Creating pgAdmin themes

To create a pgAdmin theme, you need to create a directory under
*web/pgadmin/static/scss/resources*.
Copy the sample file *\_theme.variables.scss.sample* to the new directory and
rename it to *\_theme.variables.scss*. Change the desired hexadecimal values of
the colors and bundle pgAdmin. You can also add a preview image in the theme
directory with the name as *<dir name>\_preview.png*. It is recommended that the
preview image should not be larger in size as it may take time to load on slow
networks. Run the *yarn run bundle* and you're good to go. No other changes are
required, pgAdmin bundle will read the directory and create other required
entries to make them available in preferences.

The name of the theme is derived from the directory name. Underscores (\_) and
hyphens (-) will be replaced with spaces and the result will be camel cased.

# Building the documentation

In order to build the docs, an additional Python package is required in the
virtual environment. This can be installed with the pip package manager:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install Sphinx
(venv) $ pip install sphinxcontrib-youtube
```

The docs can then be built using the Makefile in *$PGADMIN4\_SRC*, e.g.

```
(venv) $ make docs
```

The output can be found in *$PGADMIN4\_SRC/docs/en\_US/\_build/html/index.html*

# Building packages

Most packages can be built using the Makefile in $PGADMIN4\_SRC, provided all
the setup and configuration above has been completed.

To build a source tarball:

```
(venv) $ make src
```

To build a PIP Wheel, activate either a Python 3 virtual environment, configured
with all the required packages, and then run:

```
(venv) $ make pip
```

To build the macOS AppBundle, please see *pkg/mac/README*.

To build the Windows installer, please see *pkg/win32/README.txt*.

# Create Database Migrations

In order to make changes to the SQLite DB, navigate to the 'web' directory:

```
(venv) $ cd $PGADMIN4_SRC/web
```

Create a migration file with the following command:

```
(venv) $ FLASK_APP=pgAdmin4.py flask db revision
```

This will create a file in: $PGADMIN4\_SRC/web/migrations/versions/ .
Add any changes to the 'upgrade' function.
Increment the SCHEMA\_VERSION in $PGADMIN4\_SRC/web/pgadmin/model/**init**.py file.

There is no need to increment the SETTINGS\_SCHEMA\_VERSION.
