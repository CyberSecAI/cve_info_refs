# [History](#history)

Sling started as an internal project at [Day Software](http://www.day.com) , and entered the Apache Incubator in September 2007. As of June, 17th, 2009 Apache Sling is a top level project of the Apache Software Foundation.

The name "Sling" has been proposed by Roy Fielding who explained it like this:

> [The name is] Biblical in nature. The story of David: the weapon he uses to slay the giant Goliath is a sling. Hence, our David's [David Nuescheler, CTO of Day Software] favorite weapon.
>
> It is also the simplest device for delivering content very fast.
