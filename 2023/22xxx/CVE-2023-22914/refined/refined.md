- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability exists in the “account_print.cgi” CGI program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can execute unauthorized OS commands in the “tmp” directory by uploading a crafted file.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges and upload a crafted file through the vulnerable CGI program. The hotspot function needs to be enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with administrator privileges. The attacker also needs the hotspot function to be enabled on the target device.
