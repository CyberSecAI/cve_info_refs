- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Superior FAQ Plugin <= 1.0.2 lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress application under their current authentication. This could lead to unauthorized modifications or data exposure depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests, initiated by the attacker, which are then executed in the context of a logged-in user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request. This could be done via a malicious link in an email, a compromised website, or other means to entice a user to perform a specific action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
