The Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware community is excited to announce the release of Tiki 27.0 LTS. This Long-Term Support (LTS) version, which promises to be a game-changer for those anticipating the feature enhancements, will be supported until June 2029.

This version supports PHP 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3, along with MariaDB 10.5+ and MySQL 8+, ensuring compatibility with the latest server technologies.
## Major enhancements

These are some of the features receiving major enhancements: Tiki's **API functionality** was expanded to support data and system management for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Major changes were made in **calendar** event handling, recurring events, and the ability to specify periods of user availability when creating events and to specify appointment slots. And the **Markdown editing** experience was made more user-friendly while retaining compatibility with traditional Tiki syntax, via the TOAST UI editor. **Webmail** has also been enhanced as Cypht was upgraded from version 1.4x to 2.0x.

## Continuous improvement

Along with the move forward in PHP version support, the **Smarty** template engine was updated from version 4 to 5. In other areas, the search feature, including semantic search, have been enhanced, and the onsite user-mentions feature has been improved with new features . . . .

[![Community News](article_image.php?image_type=topic&id=8)](article509-My-thoughts-on-Cypht-Webmail "Community News")

Over the last 5 years, I have become increasingly involved in Cypht, an Open Source webmail client.

This project is awesome! It permits me to:

* aggregate emails from various sources in one nice list
* search throughout multiple accounts
* move emails to the right account (work vs personal vs volunteer, etc.)
* automate email management with Sieve filters
* all via a web interface, so I have the same experience on all my devices (mobile or desktop)

So I launched this 13 years ago! I am very pleased with the current state and progress. It will just get better and better as the community grows 😊

Here were the initial vision/goals/plans:

A slideshow: <https://wikisuite.org/Initial-Slideshow>

It was originally called "Tiki Suite" as a suite of tools around Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware, and also because suite also means next in French. So the next step for Tiki 😊

# Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware <= 24.1 (tikiimporter\_blog\_wordpress.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability

#### â¢ Software Link:

<https://tiki.org>

#### â¢ Affected Versions:

Version 24.1 and prior versions.

#### â¢ Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the **/lib/importer/tikiimporter\_blog\_wordpress.php** script. Specifically, when importing data from WordPress sites through the Tiki Importer, user input passed through the uploaded XML file is being used in a call to the `unserialize()` PHP function. This can be exploited by malicious users to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing them to perform a variety of attacks, such as executing arbitrary PHP code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an admin account (specifically, the **âtiki\_p\_admin\_importerâ** permission). However, due to the CSRF vulnerability described in [KIS-2023-01](/KIS-2023-01), this vulnerability might also be exploited by tricking a victim user into opening a web page like the following:

```
<html>
 <form action="http://localhost/tiki/tiki-importer.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
