# CakePHP 4.2.11, 4.3.11, and 4.4.10 Released

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
4.2.11, 4.3.11, and 4.4.10. These releases contain a security fix for the
limit() and offset() methods of Cake\Database\Query. If passed
unfiltered request data, these methods would allow for SQL injection. If your
application does not use CakePHP’s Pagination wrappers and directly passes
request data into one of these methods your application is vulnerable. We’d like
to thank ‘Tanaka’ for reporting this issue.

## Additional Bugfixes in 4.4.10

The 4.4.10 release contains the aforementioned security fix as well as the
following fixes. See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.4.9...4.4.10) for every commit.

* Update association definitions in ORM tests.
* Update build images to Ubuntu 22.04.

## Contributors to 4.4.10

Thank you to all the contributors that helped make this release happen:

* ADmad
* Kevin Pfeifer
* Mark Scherer
* Mark Story
* othercorey

As always, we would like to thank all the contributors that opened issues,
created pull requests or updated the documentation.

Disallow strings in limit() and offset()

Back in [68a08a2](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/68a08a28ca861a5faeb9cef7ce68c6e7b59aefae) int casts were removed in limit() and offset(). This
opened up the possibility for applications to provide unsafe user input
into these methods and create an injection vector.

We've been trying to narrow the accepted types, so instead of adding
casting I've added an exception when strings that are not number shaped
are provided.
