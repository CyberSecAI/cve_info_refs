Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22909:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content from phabricator.wikimedia.org explicitly mentions "CVE-2023-22909: [Unplanned, S] Mobile frontend's history makes really slow db queries". The associated bug report (T320987) confirms the CVE assignment and describes the vulnerability. The bugzilla entries also confirm this CVE ID relates to a "mediawiki: Remote DoS" issue. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from inefficient database queries in the mobile frontend's history functionality (`SpecialMobileHistory`). The queries lack an index hint, causing them to be slow, particularly for pages with a long history. This could lead to excessive resource consumption on the database server.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Inefficient Database Queries:** The primary issue is the unoptimized database query within the `SpecialMobileHistory` feature. This query does not leverage the available database indexes effectively.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** Although not explicitly stated, inefficient query construction could potentially allow a user to trigger queries that exacerbate the resource usage on the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially overload the database by repeatedly triggering slow queries through the mobile history feature, thus causing a denial-of-service condition on the server affecting all users. The content mentions that example pages like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wikipedia:Requests\_for\_page\_protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%3AHistory/Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_page_protection) are slow, which demonstrates the potential for the issue to slow the entire service down or even crash the databases.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-Based Exploitation:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending requests to the `SpecialMobileHistory` page via a web browser or script. Since it is a public endpoint, this makes the service vulnerable from anywhere on the internet, without requiring authentication.
    *   **Public Endpoint:** The `Special:History` page is publicly available, making the vulnerability easier to exploit.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No authentication required:** The attacker needs no special privileges or authentication. They can send requests to the vulnerable endpoint as a regular user.
    *   **Basic network access:** The attacker only needs basic network access to send requests to the server.

**3. Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding `rev_page_timestamp` to the query used in `SpecialMobileHistory`.
*   A patch (T320987.patch) and a corrected version(T320987(2).patch) are mentioned, and the fix was deployed.
*   The long-term solution proposed is the removal of the `SpecialMobileHistory` class/page entirely.

**4. Affected Component:**

*   The vulnerability is within the `MobileFrontend` extension for MediaWiki.

**5. Resolution:**

*   The issue was addressed in version 1.38.5 of MediaWiki.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

The CVE-2023-22909 is a remote Denial of Service vulnerability found in MediaWiki's `MobileFrontend` extension. It arises from an inefficient database query in `SpecialMobileHistory`, which lacks proper indexing and allows an attacker to overload the database by making repeated requests to that page, causing it to become nonresponsive. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users over the network. A patch has been deployed to address the issue.
