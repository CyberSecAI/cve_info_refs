# Interactive permission prompt spoofing

High

## Package

Deno
(Deno)

## Affected versions

>= 1.9

## Patched versions

>= 1.29.3

## Description

### Impact

Multi-threaded programs were able to spoof interactive permission prompt by rewriting the prompt to suggest that program is waiting on user confirmation to unrelated action.

A malicious program could clear the terminal screen after permission prompt was shown and write a generic message like so:

```
// Expected prompt
⚠️  ┌ Deno requests read access to "./log.txt".
   ├ Requested by `Deno.open()` API
   ├ Run again with --allow-read to bypass this prompt.
   └ Allow? [y/n] (y = yes, allow; n = no, deny) >

// Prompt that users would see
Do you want to continue?

```

This situation impacts users who use Web Worker API and relied on interactive permission prompt. The reproduction is very timing sensitive and can’t be reliably reproduced on every try.

This problem can not be exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers).

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in Deno v1.29.3; it is recommended all users update to this version.

### Workarounds

Run with `--no-prompt` flag to disable interactive permission prompts.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
