Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22936:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `search_listener` parameter within Splunk Enterprise. This parameter allows an authenticated user to initiate a blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The core weakness is the ability for an authenticated user to trigger requests to arbitrary URLs via the `search_listener` parameter. This is "blind" because the initiator doesn't directly see the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** While the SSRF is blind, it can be leveraged to potentially expose internal network resources and sensitive data if the attacker can infer the results of the requests or if an additional vulnerability is present.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The SSRF could be used as a stepping stone to conduct further attacks on internal systems, depending on the context and accessibility of the targeted resources.
*   **Limited Impact:** The vulnerability is considered medium severity due to its blind nature and the fact that the initiator cannot see the response without another vulnerability present. The impact is reduced because of these limitations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically exploiting a feature within Splunk's web interface.
*   **Input Parameter:** The `search_listener` parameter within search queries is the specific attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the "search" capability within Splunk.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Splunk server with the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the user cannot see the response of the request without the presence of an additional vulnerability, making the exploitability less severe than a standard SSRF.
*   Mitigation involves upgrading to patched versions of Splunk Enterprise or removing the "search" capability from users.
*   A hunting detection is provided to identify potential abuse of this vulnerability.
