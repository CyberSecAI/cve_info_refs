# Improper Preservation of Permissions in vantage6

Low

[frankcorneliusmartin](/frankcorneliusmartin)
published
GHSA-vvjv-97j8-94xh
Feb 28, 2023

## Package

pip

vantage6
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.6.1

## Patched versions

3.8.0

## Description

### Impact

Assigning existing users to a different organization is currently possible. It may lead to unintended access: if a user from organization A is accidentally assigned to organization B, they will retain their permissions and therefore might be able to access stuff they should not be allowed to access.

### Patches

Update to 3.8.0

### Workarounds

None

### References

None

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Email us at vantage6@iknl.nl

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-22738

### Weaknesses

[CWE-281](/advisories?query=cwe%3A281)
