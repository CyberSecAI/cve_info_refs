- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Advanced Custom Fields: Image Crop Add-on plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (specifically, a subscriber) can perform actions that should be reserved for users with higher privileges. The specific impact will vary depending on the exact function exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a user account with the "subscriber" role or lower on the affected WordPress site.
