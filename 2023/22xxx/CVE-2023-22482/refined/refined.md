- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to Argo CD not validating the `aud` (audience) claim in JWT tokens issued by OIDC providers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization; Missing audience validation in JWT tokens. Argo CD verifies the token's signature but not if it's intended for Argo CD as the audience.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use a stolen JWT token intended for another service to gain access to Argo CD, if the OIDC provider serves multiple audiences. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to Argo CD with the permissions granted in the token's `groups` claim.  The vulnerability also increases the blast radius of a stolen token.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack; An attacker steals a valid JWT token for a different service from the same OIDC provider.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid JWT token from an OIDC provider configured for Argo CD and that OIDC provider also needs to serve other audiences. The attacker does not require any privileges on Argo CD and can access it remotely (network).
