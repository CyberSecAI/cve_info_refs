Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its EcoStruxure TM Geo SCADA Expert
software product, formerly known as ClearSCADA.

The EcoStruxure TM Geo SCADA Expert product is an open, flexible and scalable software for
telemetry and remote SCADA solutions.

If successfully exploited, bad actors could execute a range of actions, including accessing and
disclosing sensitive information, and denial of service.

Failure to apply the remediations provided below may risk unauthorized system access, which
could result in SCADA configuration data being exposed or a loss of service.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we recommend restricting access to
the Geo SCADA server's database port (default 5481). Access should
be available only to ViewX clients.

Refer to the Geo SCADA Expert Help documentation for advice and
best practices for putting networks and remote devices behind
firewalls and isolating them from the business network and public
networks. Specific advice is listed below:

•  To protect client/server communications we recommend using

the features in Geo SCADA Expert 2021 which perform
server-side checks of client certificates. This feature helps
protect against unknown clients connecting to the server.
•  Disable the setting “Allow guest user to execute SQL” if it is

enabled.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  Configure the Client Access Control list, which prevents

unauthorized IP addresses from connecting. Also, you can
use this to restrict access to Geo SCADA Server’s web
services port(s) (default 443).

We recommend upgrading to the software versions listed in the
section above. Customers using ClearSCADA should also upgrade to
the latest GeoSCADA release.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
