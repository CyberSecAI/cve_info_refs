- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the IBM Robotic Process Automation Web UI, which allows embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI. This could potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session, allowing the attacker to perform actions with the victim's privileges. It can also be used to alter intended functionality of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Web UI of the application by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to insert malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, likely through input fields or other interactive elements. This may require a low level of access.
