- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `LoginAuth` function in `requestHandlers.js` constructs an SQL query using string concatenation, instead of using a prepared statement. This allows for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted network request (e.g. via HTTP POST) to the `/LoginAuth` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable web server, with no prior authentication needed.
