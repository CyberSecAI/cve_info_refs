Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of a hardcoded secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for authentication within the Izanami application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Secret:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded secret within the application's Docker image. This allows anyone with access to this secret to forge valid authentication tokens.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the predictable nature of JWTs signed with the hardcoded key, an attacker can create a valid token without needing valid user credentials, effectively bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full access to an Izanami instance, regardless of whether they have a valid user account.
- **Data Manipulation:** With full access, the attacker could read, modify, or delete data within the Izanami system.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially modify feature flags and impact the behavior of the overall system using Izanami.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed over the network by crafting a malicious cookie that will be passed along with the victim's web traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to an Izanami Instance:** The attacker needs access to any instance of Izanami, even their own, to obtain a valid token.
- **Network Access to Victim Instance:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the targeted Izanami instance to inject the forged cookie.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of Izanami prior to 1.11.0.
- The patched version 1.11.0 should be used to mitigate the issue.
- The provided CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) reflects the severity of this vulnerability due to the ease of exploitation and significant impact.
- The vulnerability was discovered by RaphaÃ«l LOB from Synacktiv.
- The issue is tracked under CVE-2023-22495 and GHSA-9r7j-m337-792c.
