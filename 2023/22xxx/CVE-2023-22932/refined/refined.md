Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-22932

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within a view in Splunk Enterprise. Specifically, the error message associated with a Base64-encoded image is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious scripts can be embedded within the Base64-encoded image error message, which are then stored and executed when other users access the affected view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The injected scripts can perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially leading to data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.
- **Persistent Control:** If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain persistent control over the affected Splunk instance.
- **Compromised Integrity and Confidentiality:** The overall integrity and confidentiality of the Splunk instance can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Base64-encoded image that is displayed in a view's error message.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to access the view containing the maliciously crafted Base64 image. This makes it a reflected XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Splunk Access:** The attacker needs a Splunk user account with the ability to create or modify views.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this vulnerability and know how to craft malicious Base64-encoded images.
- **Targeted User:** An unsuspecting user needs to access the view containing the malicious content for the XSS to execute.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability only affects Splunk Enterprise 9.0 versions prior to 9.0.4.
- Splunk Web must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- A detection search is provided that looks for users potentially adding malicious payloads and users that were exposed to the payload.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Splunk Enterprise 9.0.4 or later.
- Disable Splunk Web on indexers in a distributed environment if not needed.
