Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-22436:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Description:** The kernel subsystem function `check_permission_for_set_tokenid` has a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Use-After-Free in the `check_permission_for_set_tokenid` function within the kernel subsystem. This likely involves a scenario where memory is freed, and then a pointer to that memory is accessed, resulting in undefined behavior and potential security issues.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use-After-Free (UAF)
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker can exploit this UAF vulnerability to escalate their privileges to root. This means an attacker who already has some access to the system can gain full control.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would need to execute code on the target system to trigger the vulnerable function.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system
