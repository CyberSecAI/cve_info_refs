Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the SUSHIRO App for Android outputting sensitive information to the log file. This is a common issue where applications, during their operation, unintentionally write sensitive data to log files that are accessible beyond the application's intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File:** The core weakness is the logging of sensitive data. This practice violates security best practices because log files are often stored in locations accessible by other apps or malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:**  An attacker who gains access to the log file can potentially obtain credential information. This could include passwords, API keys, tokens, or other secrets used to authenticate with the application's backend services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the device's file system where the logs are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the Android device on which the vulnerable application is installed. This could be achieved through malware, physical access, or other means of gaining access to the device's storage.
*  No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Multiple versions of the SUSHIRO app are affected across different regions, including Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability is addressed by updating the app to the latest version, which includes fixes to prevent sensitive data from being logged.
*   **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 (Local access, high confidentiality impact) and a CVSS v2 base score of 4.9 (Local access, complete confidentiality impact). These scores indicate a potentially significant risk to the confidentiality of user data.
*   **Data Encryption:** It's also worth noting that the Japanese version of the application transmits data unencrypted, further increasing the risk profile. This is a separate issue but is mentioned within the same context.
