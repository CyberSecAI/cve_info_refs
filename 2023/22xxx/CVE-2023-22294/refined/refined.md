- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When two nodes are joined in a cluster, the secondary node fails to restrict permissions on a secret transferred from the primary node, making it world-readable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions on `/etc/cma/api.secret` on the secondary node in a cluster setup, leading to world-readable access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to a *Monitoring Site* can read the secret and gain root access on both cluster nodes.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker gains access to a *Monitoring Site*.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to a *Monitoring Site* to exploit the vulnerability.
