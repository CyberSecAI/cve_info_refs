Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-22746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause was the use of a shared, default secret key across multiple CKAN instances when using specific Docker images. This occurred because the images did not generate a unique secret key during container creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Session Secret:** The primary weakness was the use of a static, default session secret key in Docker images. This made it possible to predict the key.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration of the Docker images was insecure, leading to the shared secret issue.
- **Lack of Key Generation:** The images failed to implement a mechanism to generate a unique secret key for each new container instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Forging:** With the shared secret key, attackers could forge authentication requests and potentially gain unauthorized access to CKAN instances.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions due to the predictable session secret, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **API Token Compromise:** Existing API tokens were invalidated by the fix, highlighting their reliance on the compromised key and their vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Docker Image Deployment:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by targeting CKAN instances deployed using the vulnerable Docker images.
- **Networked CKAN Instances:** If multiple CKAN instances were deployed using the same vulnerable image and were accessible to an attacker, this would increase the potential for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Images:** Attackers needed to be aware of the specific vulnerable Docker images (ckan/ckan-docker, okfn/docker-ckan, keitaroinc/docker-ckan) and the shared secret key issue.
- **Access to CKAN Instance:** Attackers required access to a CKAN instance deployed using a vulnerable image, or an ability to intercept/modify requests.
- **Ability to Forge Requests:** Attackers would need the capability to forge authentication requests, which would require technical knowledge of web authentication and how CKAN handles session and tokens.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Images:** The vulnerability specifically affected the `ckan/ckan-docker`, `okfn/docker-ckan`, and `keitaroinc/docker-ckan` images but not the legacy images located in the main CKAN repo.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by patching the images to generate new secret keys upon container creation. Users were also advised to use environment variables or other means to set a custom session secret.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability was classified as "High" due to its potential impact on authentication and security.
