The sudoedit binary can\n   be abused to allow the modification of any file on the\n   filesystem. This is a known security vulnerability (per\n   <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/42>), but had not been\n   disclosed for the ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance.

       "summary": "The identified vulnerability is a privilege escalation in the `sudoedit` feature of Sudo, affecting versions 1.8.0 through 1.9.12p1. It arises from mishandling of user-provided editor environment variables, which allows attackers to bypass intended sudoers restrictions and edit unauthorized files.  This is achieved by injecting a `--` argument into the editor path, which causes `sudoedit` to misinterpret subsequent arguments as files to be edited, regardless of sudoers rules. The impact is that a local user with `sudoedit` privileges can gain root access via arbitrary file modification and command execution. Mitigation involves preventing user-specified editors, and the fix is available in Sudo 1.9.12p2."
