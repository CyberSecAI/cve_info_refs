- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A regular expression used in the model name parsing section of the GlobalID gem is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a ReDoS which occurs when a specially crafted input is processed by a vulnerable regular expression, causing the regex engine to take an unexpectedly long time, leading to DoS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input to the model name parsing logic of the GlobalID gem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable code that triggers the vulnerable regular expression.
