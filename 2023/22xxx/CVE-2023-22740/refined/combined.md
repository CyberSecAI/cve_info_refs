This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

SECURITY: Limit chat drafts length and preloaded count ([#19987](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/19987))

```
Only allow maximum of `50_000` characters for chat drafts. A hidden `max_chat_draft_length` setting can control this limit. A migration is also provided to delete any abusive draft in the database.

The number of drafts loaded on current user has also been limited and ordered by most recent update.

Note that spec files moved are not directly related to the fix.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
