- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hughes Satellite Router contains a cross-frame scripting via remote file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-frame scripting (XFS) via remote file inclusion (RFI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated malicious user can misuse frames, include JS/HTML code, and steal sensitive information from legitimate users of the application. This can lead to security bypass, exposure of sensitive information, and cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by including malicious JS/HTML code via the RFI vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
