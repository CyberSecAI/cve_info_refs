#### Hughes Satellite Router Remote File Inclusion Cross-Frame Scripting

Title: Hughes Satellite Router Remote File Inclusion Cross-Frame Scripting

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2022-5743](ZSL-2022-5743.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Security Bypass, Exposure of Sensitive Information, Cross-Site Scripting

Risk: (4/5)

Release Date: 28.12.2022
##### Summary

The HX200 is a high-performance satellite router designed to
provide carrier-grade IP services using dynamically assigned high-bandwidth
satellite IP connectivity. The HX200 satellite router provides flexible
Quality of Service (QoS) features that can be tailored to the network
applications at each individual remote router, such as Adaptive Constant
Bit Rate (CBR) bandwidth assignment to deliver high-quality, low jitter
bandwidth for real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or videoconferencing.
With integrated IP features including RIPv1, RIPv2, BGP, DHCP, NAT/PAT,
and DNS Server/Relay functionality, together with a high-performance
satellite modem, the HX200 is a full-featured IP Router with an integrated
high-performance satellite router. The HX200 enables high- performance
IP connectivity for a variety of applications including cellular backhaul,
MPLS extension services, virtual leased line, mobile services and other
high-bandwidth solutions.
##### Description

The router contains a cross-frame scripting via remote file inclusion
vulnerability that may potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise
an affected system. This vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated malicious
user to misuse frames, include JS/HTML code and steal sensitive information
from legitimate users of the application.
