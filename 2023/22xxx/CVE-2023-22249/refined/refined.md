- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS (CWE-79), allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed when other users access the affected functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into a stored location within the application. When a user accesses this stored data, the malicious script executes within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires administrative privileges to inject the malicious script and the vulnerability requires user interaction.
