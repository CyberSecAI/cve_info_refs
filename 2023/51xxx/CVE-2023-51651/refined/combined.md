# Potential URI resolution path traversal in the AWS SDK for PHP

Moderate

[stobrien89](/stobrien89)
published
GHSA-557v-xcg6-rm5m
Dec 21, 2023

## Package

composer

aws/aws-sdk-php
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<3.288.1

## Patched versions

>=3.288.1

## Description

### Impact

Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the`buildEndpoint` method in the `RestSerializer` component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 `UriResolver` utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed.

Versions of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 before 3.288.1 are affected by this issue.

### Patches

Upgrade to the AWS SDK for PHP >= 3.288.1, if you are on version < 3.288.1.

### References

RFC 3986 - [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.4)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
