## Vulnerability details

[![image-20231221214813987](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221214813987.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221214813987.png)

Use ’，‘ to segment data from the `staticroute list` and pass in the `sub_437028` function

[![image-20231221214821593](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221214821593.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221214821593.png)

This part of the data was directly passed in `FCGI_popen` without any filtering

[![image-20231221215626633](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221215626633.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/1/img/image-20231221215626633.png)

`FCGI_popen`Called `popen` to create a pipeline to execute the command.

Based on the cause of the vulnerability, we only need to use commas to separate three addresses and the command to be executed. The final constructed EXP is as follows:
