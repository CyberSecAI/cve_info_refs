Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-44879

    Wenqing Liu reported a NULL pointer dereference in the f2fs
    implementation. An attacker able to mount a specially crafted image
    can take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2023-0590

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the network scheduler
    core that that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1077

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the task
    scheduler.  A local user might be able to exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1989

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth
    adapter driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker
    able to insert and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run
    arbitrary code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
    could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference
    when mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect error path handling may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

    subsystem which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-4244

    A race condition was found in the nftables subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash), information leak, or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-4622

    Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered a use-after-free within the Unix
    domain sockets component, which may result in local privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-4623

    Budimir Markovic reported a missing configuration check in the
    sch_hfsc network scheduler that could lead to a use-after-free or
    other problems.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in
    any user or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-4921

    "valis" reported flaws in the sch_qfq network scheduler that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in any user or network namespace could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-5717

    Budimir Markovic reported a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability
    in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system caused by improper
    handling of event groups, which may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation. The default settings in Debian prevent
    exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in
    the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2023-6606

    "j51569436" reported a potential out-of-bounds read in the CIFS
    filesystem implementation.  If a CIFS filesystem is mounted from a
    malicious server, the server could possibly exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-6931

    Budimir Markovic reported a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability
    in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system which may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation. The default settings in
    Debian prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have
    been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2023-6932

    A use-after-free vulnerability in the IPv4 IGMP implementation may
    result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-25775

    Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail and Shiraz
    Saleem discovered that improper access control in the Intel Ethernet
    Controller RDMA driver may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-34319

    Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
    which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
    virtualisation host by sending malformed packets.

CVE-2023-34324

    Marek Marczykowski-Gorecki reported a possible deadlock in the Xen
    guests event channel code which may allow a malicious guest
    administrator to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-39189, CVE-2023-39192, CVE-2023-39193

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported missing
    bounds checks in the nfnetlink_osf, xt_u32, and xt_sctp netfilter
    modules.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace could exploit these to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel or for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-39194

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported a missing
    bounds check in the xfrm (IPsec) subsystem.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace could
    exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel or for
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-40283

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket
    handling.

CVE-2023-42753

    Kyle Zeng discovered an off-by-one error in the netfilter ipset
    subsystem which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or
    network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) and possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-42754

    Kyle Zeng discovered a flaw in the IPv4 implementation which could
    lead to a null pointer deference.  A local user could exploit this
    for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-42755

    Kyle Zeng discovered missing configuration validation in the
    cls_rsvp network classifier which could lead to out-of-bounds
    reads.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to leak sensitive information.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the cls_rsvp classifier.

CVE-2023-45863

    A race condition in library routines for handling generic kernel
    objects may result in an out-of-bounds write in the
    fill_kobj_path() function.

CVE-2023-45871

    Manfred Rudigier reported a flaw in the igb network driver for
    Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  When the "rx-all" feature was
    enabled on such a network interface, an attacker on the same
    network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive
    buffer, leading to a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly remote code execution.

CVE-2023-51780

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Appletalk subsystem
    may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51782

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Amateur Radio X.25
    PLP (Rose) support may lead to a use-after-free. This module is not
    auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems
    where it is explicitly loaded.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.304-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes
from stable updates 4.19.290-4.19.304 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

```
Because atalk_ioctl() accesses sk->sk_receive_queue
without holding a sk->sk_receive_queue.lock, it can
cause a race with atalk_recvmsg().
A use-after-free for skb occurs with the following flow.
```
atalk_ioctl() -> skb_peek()
atalk_recvmsg() -> skb_recv_datagram() -> skb_free_datagram()
```
Add sk->sk_receive_queue.lock to atalk_ioctl() to fix this issue.

RDMA/mlx5: Change the key being sent for MPV device affiliation
commit 02e7d139e5e24abb5fde91934fc9dc0344ac1926 upstream.
Change the key that we send from IB driver to EN driver regarding the
MPV device affiliation, since at that stage the IB device is not yet
initialized, so its index would be zero for different IB devices and
cause wrong associations between unrelated master and slave devices.
Instead use a unique value from inside the core device which is already
initialized at this stage.

x86/speculation, objtool: Use absolute relocations for annotations
commit b8ec60e1186cdcfce41e7db4c827cb107e459002 upstream.
.discard.retpoline\_safe sections do not have the SHF\_ALLOC flag. These
sections referencing text sections' STT\_SECTION symbols with PC-relative
relocations like R\_386\_PC32 [0] is conceptually not suitable. Newer
LLD will report warnings for REL relocations even for relocatable links [1]:
ld.lld: warning: vmlinux.a(drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-i801.o):(.discard.retpoline\_safe+0x120): has non-ABS relocation R\_386\_PC32 against symbol ''
Switch to absolute relocations instead, which indicate link-time
addresses. In a relocatable link, these addresses are also output
section offsets, used by checks in tools/objtool/check.c. When linking
vmlinux, these .discard.\* sections will be discarded, therefore it is
not a problem that R\_X86\_64\_32 cannot represent a kernel address.
Alternatively, we could set the SHF\_ALLOC flag for .discard.\* sections,
but I think non-SHF\_ALLOC for sections to be discarded makes more sense.
Note: if we decide to never support REL architectures (e.g. arm, i386),
we can utilize R\_\*\_NONE relocations (.reloc ., BFD\_RELOC\_NONE, sym),
making .discard.\* sections zero-sized. That said, the section content
waste is 4 bytes per entry, much smaller than sizeof(Elf{32,64}\_Rel).

ring-buffer: Have rb\_time\_cmpxchg() set the msb counter too
commit 0aa0e5289cfe984a8a9fdd79ccf46ccf080151f7 upstream.
The rb\_time\_cmpxchg() on 32-bit architectures requires setting three
32-bit words to represent the 64-bit timestamp, with some salt for
synchronization. Those are: msb, top, and bottom
The issue is, the rb\_time\_cmpxchg() did not properly salt the msb portion,
and the msb that was written was stale.

ring-buffer: Do not try to put back write\_stamp
commit dd939425707898da992e59ab0fcfae4652546910 upstream.
If an update to an event is interrupted by another event between the time
the initial event allocated its buffer and where it wrote to the
write\_stamp, the code try to reset the write stamp back to the what it had
just overwritten. It knows that it was overwritten via checking the
before\_stamp, and if it didn't match what it wrote to the before\_stamp
before it allocated its space, it knows it was overwritten.
To put back the write\_stamp, it uses the before\_stamp it read. The problem
here is that by writing the before\_stamp to the write\_stamp it makes the
two equal again, which means that the write\_stamp can be considered valid
as the last timestamp written to the ring buffer. But this is not
necessarily true. The event that interrupted the event could have been
interrupted in a way that it was interrupted as well, and can end up
leaving with an invalid write\_stamp. But if this happens and returns to
this context that uses the before\_stamp to update the write\_stamp again,
it can possibly incorrectly make it valid, causing later events to have in
correct time stamps.
As it is OK to leave this function with an invalid write\_stamp (one that
doesn't match the before\_stamp), there's no reason to try to make it valid
again in this case. If this race happens, then just leave with the invalid
write\_stamp and the next event to come along will just add a absolute
timestamp and validate everything again.
Bonus points: This gets rid of another cmpxchg64!

ring-buffer: Fix a race in rb\_time\_cmpxchg() for 32 bit archs
commit fff88fa0fbc7067ba46dde570912d63da42c59a9 upstream.
Mathieu Desnoyers pointed out an issue in the rb\_time\_cmpxchg() for 32 bit
architectures. That is:
static bool rb\_time\_cmpxchg(rb\_time\_t \*t, u64 expect, u64 set)
{
unsigned long cnt, top, bottom, msb;
unsigned long cnt2, top2, bottom2, msb2;
u64 val;
/\* The cmpxchg always fails if it interrupted an update \*/
if (!\_\_rb\_time\_read(t, &val, &cnt2))
return false;
if (val != expect)
return false;
<<<< interrupted here!
cnt = local\_read(&t->cnt);
The problem is that the synchronization counter in the rb\_time\_t is read
\*after\* the value of the timestamp is read. That means if an interrupt
were to come in between the value being read and the counter being read,
it can change the value and the counter and the interrupted process would
be clueless about it!
The counter needs to be read first and then the value. That way it is easy
to tell if the value is stale or not. If the counter hasn't been updated,
then the value is still good.

ring-buffer: Fix writing to the buffer with max\_data\_size
commit b3ae7b67b87fed771fa5bf95389df06b0433603e upstream.
The maximum ring buffer data size is the maximum size of data that can be
recorded on the ring buffer. Events must be smaller than the sub buffer
data size minus any meta data. This size is checked before trying to
allocate from the ring buffer because the allocation assumes that the size
will fit on the sub buffer.
The maximum size was calculated as the size of a sub buffer page (which is
currently PAGE\_SIZE minus the sub buffer header) minus the size of the
meta data of an individual event. But it missed the possible adding of a
time stamp for events that are added long enough apart that the event meta
data can't hold the time delta.
When an event is added that is greater than the current BUF\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE
minus the size of a time stamp, but still less than or equal to
BUF\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE, the ring buffer would go into an infinite loop, looking
for a page that can hold the event. Luckily, there's a check for this loop
and after 1000 iterations and a warning is emitted and the ring buffer is
disabled. But this should never happen.
This can happen when a large event is added first, or after a long period
where an absolute timestamp is prefixed to the event, increasing its size
by 8 bytes. This passes the check and then goes into the algorithm that
causes the infinite loop.
For events that are the first event on the sub-buffer, it does not need to
add a timestamp, because the sub-buffer itself contains an absolute
timestamp, and adding one is redundant.
The fix is to check if the event is to be the first event on the
sub-buffer, and if it is, then do not add a timestamp.
This also fixes 32 bit adding a timestamp when a read of before\_stamp or
write\_stamp is interrupted. There's still no need to add that timestamp if
the event is going to be the first event on the sub buffer.
Also, if the buffer has "time\_stamp\_abs" set, then also check if the
length plus the timestamp is greater than the BUF\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE.

ring-buffer: Have saved event hold the entire event
commit b049525855fdd0024881c9b14b8fbec61c3f53d3 upstream.
For the ring buffer iterator (non-consuming read), the event needs to be
copied into the iterator buffer to make sure that a writer does not
overwrite it while the user is reading it. If a write happens during the
copy, the buffer is simply discarded.
But the temp buffer itself was not big enough. The allocation of the
buffer was only BUF\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE, which is the maximum data size that can
be passed into the ring buffer and saved. But the temp buffer needs to
hold the meta data as well. That would be BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE and not
BUF\_MAX\_DATA\_SIZE.

ring-buffer: Do not update before stamp when switching sub-buffers
commit 9e45e39dc249c970d99d2681f6bcb55736fd725c upstream.
The ring buffer timestamps are synchronized by two timestamp placeholders.
One is the "before\_stamp" and the other is the "write\_stamp" (sometimes
referred to as the "after stamp" but only in the comments. These two
stamps are key to knowing how to handle nested events coming in with a
lockless system.
When moving across sub-buffers, the before stamp is updated but the write
stamp is not. There's an effort to put back the before stamp to something
that seems logical in case there's nested events. But as the current event
is about to cross sub-buffers, and so will any new nested event that happens,
updating the before stamp is useless, and could even introduce new race
conditions.
The first event on a sub-buffer simply uses the sub-buffer's timestamp
and keeps a "delta" of zero. The "before\_stamp" and "write\_stamp" are not
used in the algorithm in this case. There's no reason to try to fix the
before\_stamp when this happens.
As a bonus, it removes a cmpxchg() when crossing sub-buffers!

tracing: Update snapshot buffer on resize if it is allocated
commit d06aff1cb13d2a0d52b48e605462518149c98c81 upstream.
The snapshot buffer is to mimic the main buffer so that when a snapshot is
needed, the snapshot and main buffer are swapped. When the snapshot buffer
is allocated, it is set to the minimal size that the ring buffer may be at
and still functional. When it is allocated it becomes the same size as the
main ring buffer, and when the main ring buffer changes in size, it should
do.
Currently, the resize only updates the snapshot buffer if it's used by the
current tracer (ie. the preemptirqsoff tracer). But it needs to be updated
anytime it is allocated.
When changing the size of the main buffer, instead of looking to see if
the current tracer is utilizing the snapshot buffer, just check if it is
allocated to know if it should be updated or not.
Also fix typo in comment just above the code change.

ring-buffer: Fix memory leak of free page
commit 17d801758157bec93f26faaf5ff1a8b9a552d67a upstream.
Reading the ring buffer does a swap of a sub-buffer within the ring buffer
with a empty sub-buffer. This allows the reader to have full access to the
content of the sub-buffer that was swapped out without having to worry
about contention with the writer.
The readers call ring\_buffer\_alloc\_read\_page() to allocate a page that
will be used to swap with the ring buffer. When the code is finished with
the reader page, it calls ring\_buffer\_free\_read\_page(). Instead of freeing
the page, it stores it as a spare. Then next call to
ring\_buffer\_alloc\_read\_page() will return this spare instead of calling
into the memory management system to allocate a new page.
Unfortunately, on freeing of the ring buffer, this spare page is not
freed, and causes a memory leak.

drm/i915: Fix remapped stride with CCS on ADL+
commit 0ccd963fe555451b1f84e6d14d2b3ef03dd5c947 upstream.
On ADL+ the hardware automagically calculates the CCS AUX surface
stride from the main surface stride, so when remapping we can't
really play a lot of tricks with the main surface stride, or else
the AUX surface stride would get miscalculated and no longer
match the actual data layout in memory.
Supposedly we could remap in 256 main surface tile units
(AUX page(4096)/cachline(64)\*4(4x1 main surface tiles per
AUX cacheline)=256 main surface tiles), but the extra complexity
is probably not worth the hassle.
So let's just make sure our mapping stride is calculated from
the full framebuffer stride (instead of the framebuffer width).
This way the stride we program into PLANE\_STRIDE will be the
original framebuffer stride, and thus there will be no change
to the AUX stride/layout.

drm/i915: Fix intel\_atomic\_setup\_scalers() plane\_state handling
commit c3070f080f9ba18dea92eaa21730f7ab85b5c8f4 upstream.
Since the plane\_state variable is declared outside the scaler\_users
loop in intel\_atomic\_setup\_scalers(), and it's never reset back to
NULL inside the loop we may end up calling intel\_atomic\_setup\_scaler()
with a non-NULL plane state for the pipe scaling case. That is bad
because intel\_atomic\_setup\_scaler() determines whether we are doing
plane scaling or pipe scaling based on plane\_state!=NULL. The end
result is that we may miscalculate the scaler mode for pipe scaling.
The hardware becomes somewhat upset if we end up in this situation
when scanning out a planar format on a SDR plane. We end up
programming the pipe scaler into planar mode as well, and the
result is a screenfull of garbage.
Fix the situation by making sure we pass the correct plane\_state==NULL
when calculating the scaler mode for pipe scaling.

drm/i915: Fix ADL+ tiled plane stride when the POT stride is smaller than the original
commit 324b70e997aab0a7deab8cb90711faccda4e98c8 upstream.
plane\_view\_scanout\_stride() currently assumes that we had to pad the
mapping stride with dummy pages in order to align it. But that is not
the case if the original fb stride exceeds the aligned stride used
to populate the remapped view, which is calculated from the user
specified framebuffer width rather than the user specified framebuffer
stride.
Ignore the original fb stride in this case and just stick to the POT
aligned stride. Getting this wrong will cause the plane to fetch the
wrong data, and can lead to fault errors if the page tables at the
bogus location aren't even populated.
TODO: figure out if this is OK for CCS, or if we should instead increase
the width of the view to cover the entire user specified fb stride
instead...

drm/amd/display: Disable PSR-SU on Parade 0803 TCON again
commit e7ab758741672acb21c5d841a9f0309d30e48a06 upstream.
When screen brightness is rapidly changed and PSR-SU is enabled the
display hangs on panels with this TCON even on the latest DCN 3.1.4
microcode (0x8002a81 at this time).
This was disabled previously as commit 072030b17830 ("drm/amd: Disable
PSR-SU on Parade 0803 TCON") but reverted as commit 1e66a17ce546 ("Revert
"drm/amd: Disable PSR-SU on Parade 0803 TCON"") in favor of testing for
a new enough microcode (commit cd2e31a9ab93 ("drm/amd/display: Set minimum
requirement for using PSR-SU on Phoenix")).
As hangs are still happening specifically with this TCON, disable PSR-SU
again for it until it can be root caused.

This behavior was introduced by commit d9e865826c20 ("drm/amd/display:

btrfs: don't clear qgroup reserved bit in release\_folio
commit a86805504b88f636a6458520d85afdf0634e3c6b upstream.
The EXTENT\_QGROUP\_RESERVED bit is used to "lock" regions of the file for
duplicate reservations. That is two writes to that range in one
transaction shouldn't create two reservations, as the reservation will
only be freed once when the write finally goes down. Therefore, it is
never OK to clear that bit without freeing the associated qgroup
reserve. At this point, we don't want to be freeing the reserve, so mask
off the bit.

btrfs: fix qgroup\_free\_reserved\_data int overflow
commit 9e65bfca24cf1d77e4a5c7a170db5867377b3fe7 upstream.
The reserved data counter and input parameter is a u64, but we
inadvertently accumulate it in an int. Overflowing that int results in
freeing the wrong amount of data and breaking reserve accounting.
Unfortunately, this overflow rot spreads from there, as the qgroup
release/free functions rely on returning an int to take advantage of
negative values for error codes.
Therefore, the full fix is to return the "released" or "freed" amount by
a u64 argument and to return 0 or negative error code via the return
value.
Most of the call sites simply ignore the return value, though some
of them handle the error and count the returned bytes. Change all of
them accordingly.

btrfs: free qgroup reserve when ORDERED\_IOERR is set
commit f63e1164b90b385cd832ff0fdfcfa76c3cc15436 upstream.
An ordered extent completing is a critical moment in qgroup reserve
handling, as the ownership of the reservation is handed off from the
ordered extent to the delayed ref. In the happy path we release (unlock)
but do not free (decrement counter) the reservation, and the delayed ref
drives the free. However, on an error, we don't create a delayed ref,
since there is no ref to add. Therefore, free on the error path.

kexec: drop dependency on ARCH\_SUPPORTS\_KEXEC from CRASH\_DUMP
commit c41bd2514184d75db087fe4c1221237fb7922875 upstream.
In commit f8ff23429c62 ("kernel/Kconfig.kexec: drop select of KEXEC for
CRASH\_DUMP") we tried to fix a config regression, where CONFIG\_CRASH\_DUMP
required CONFIG\_KEXEC.
However, it was not enough at least for arm64 platforms. While further
testing the patch with our arm64 config I noticed that CONFIG\_CRASH\_DUMP
is unavailable in menuconfig. This is because CONFIG\_CRASH\_DUMP still
depends on the new CONFIG\_ARCH\_SUPPORTS\_KEXEC introduced in commit
91506f7e5d21 ("arm64/kexec: refactor for kernel/Kconfig.kexec") and on
arm64 CONFIG\_ARCH\_SUPPORTS\_KEXEC requires CONFIG\_PM\_SLEEP\_SMP=y, which in
turn requires either CONFIG\_SUSPEND=y or CONFIG\_HIBERNATION=y neither of
which are set in our config.
Given that we already established that CONFIG\_KEXEC (which is a switch for
kexec system call itself) is not required for CONFIG\_CRASH\_DUMP drop
CONFIG\_ARCH\_SUPPORTS\_KEXEC dependency as well. The arm64 kernel builds
just fine with CONFIG\_CRASH\_DUMP=y and with both CONFIG\_KEXEC=n and
CONFIG\_KEXEC\_FILE=n after f8ff23429c62 ("kernel/Kconfig.kexec: drop select
of KEXEC for CRASH\_DUMP") and this patch are applied given that the
necessary shared bits are included via CONFIG\_KEXEC\_CORE dependency.

mm/mglru: reclaim offlined memcgs harder
commit 4376807bf2d5371c3e00080c972be568c3f8a7d1 upstream.
In the effort to reduce zombie memcgs [1], it was discovered that the
memcg LRU doesn't apply enough pressure on offlined memcgs. Specifically,
instead of rotating them to the tail of the current generation
(MEMCG\_LRU\_TAIL) for a second attempt, it moves them to the next
generation (MEMCG\_LRU\_YOUNG) after the first attempt.
Not applying enough pressure on offlined memcgs can cause them to build
up, and this can be particularly harmful to memory-constrained systems.

mm/mglru: respect min\_ttl\_ms with memcgs
commit 8aa420617918d12d1f5d55030a503c9418e73c2c upstream.
While investigating kswapd "consuming 100% CPU" [1] (also see "mm/mglru:
try to stop at high watermarks"), it was discovered that the memcg LRU can
breach the thrashing protection imposed by min\_ttl\_ms.
Before the memcg LRU:
kswapd()
shrink\_node\_memcgs()
mem\_cgroup\_iter()
inc\_max\_seq() // always hit a different memcg
lru\_gen\_age\_node()
mem\_cgroup\_iter()
check the timestamp of the oldest generation
After the memcg LRU:
kswapd()
shrink\_many()
restart:
iterate the memcg LRU:
inc\_max\_seq() // occasionally hit the same memcg
if raced with lru\_gen\_rotate\_memcg():
goto restart
lru\_gen\_age\_node()
mem\_cgroup\_iter()
check the timestamp of the oldest generation
Specifically, when the restart happens in shrink\_many(), it needs to stick
with the (memcg LRU) generation it began with. In other words, it should
neither re-read memcg\_lru->seq nor age an lruvec of a different
generation. Otherwise it can hit the same memcg multiple times without
giving lru\_gen\_age\_node() a chance to check the timestamp of that memcg's
oldest generation (against min\_ttl\_ms).

mm/mglru: try to stop at high watermarks
commit 5095a2b23987d3c3c47dd16b3d4080e2733b8bb9 upstream.
The initial MGLRU patchset didn't include the memcg LRU support, and it
relied on should\_abort\_scan(), added by commit f76c83378851 ("mm:
multi-gen LRU: optimize multiple memcgs"), to "backoff to avoid
overshooting their aggregate reclaim target by too much".
Later on when the memcg LRU was added, should\_abort\_scan() was deemed
unnecessary, and the test results [1] showed no side effects after it was
removed by commit a579086c99ed ("mm: multi-gen LRU: remove eviction
fairness safeguard").
However, that test used memory.reclaim, which sets nr\_to\_reclaim to
SWAP\_CLUSTER\_MAX. So it can overshoot only by SWAP\_CLUSTER\_MAX-1 pages,
i.e., from nr\_reclaimed=nr\_to\_reclaim-1 to
nr\_reclaimed=nr\_to\_reclaim+SWAP\_CLUSTER\_MAX-1. Compared with the batch
size kswapd sets to nr\_to\_reclaim, SWAP\_CLUSTER\_MAX is tiny. Therefore
that test isn't able to reproduce the worst case scenario, i.e., kswapd
overshooting GBs on large systems and "consuming 100% CPU" (see the Closes
tag).
Bring back a simplified version of should\_abort\_scan() on top of the memcg
LRU, so that kswapd stops when all eligible zones are above their
respective high watermarks plus a small delta to lower the chance of
KSWAPD\_HIGH\_WMARK\_HIT\_QUICKLY. Note that this only applies to order-0
reclaim, meaning compaction-induced reclaim can still run wild (which is a
different problem).

mm/mglru: fix underprotected page cache
commit 081488051d28d32569ebb7c7a23572778b2e7d57 upstream.
Unmapped folios accessed through file descriptors can be underprotected.
Those folios are added to the oldest generation based on:
1. The fact that they are less costly to reclaim (no need to walk the
rmap and flush the TLB) and have less impact on performance (don't
cause major PFs and can be non-blocking if needed again).
2. The observation that they are likely to be single-use. E.g., for
client use cases like Android, its apps parse configuration files
and store the data in heap (anon); for server use cases like MySQL,
it reads from InnoDB files and holds the cached data for tables in
buffer pools (anon).
However, the oldest generation can be very short lived, and if so, it
doesn't provide the PID controller with enough time to respond to a surge
of refaults. (Note that the PID controller uses weighted refaults and
those from evicted generations only take a half of the whole weight.) In
other words, for a short lived generation, the moving average smooths out
the spike quickly.
To fix the problem:
1. For folios that are already on LRU, if they can be beyond the
tracking range of tiers, i.e., five accesses through file
descriptors, move them to the second oldest generation to give them
more time to age. (Note that tiers are used by the PID controller
to statistically determine whether folios accessed multiple times
through file descriptors are worth protecting.)
2. When adding unmapped folios to LRU, adjust the placement of them so
that they are not too close to the tail. The effect of this is
similar to the above.

dmaengine: stm32-dma: avoid bitfield overflow assertion
commit 54bed6bafa0f38daf9697af50e3aff5ff1354fe1 upstream.

in turn triggers an assertion because it does not fit into a two-bit field:

drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2: add begin/end\_use ring callbacks
commit ab4750332dbe535243def5dcebc24ca00c1f98ac upstream.
Add begin/end\_use ring callbacks to disallow GFXOFF when
SDMA work is submitted and allow it again afterward.
This should avoid corner cases where GFXOFF is erroneously
entered when SDMA is still active. For now just allow/disallow
GFXOFF in the begin and end helpers until we root cause the
issue. This should not impact power as SDMA usage is pretty
minimal and GFXOSS should not be active when SDMA is active
anyway, this just makes it explicit.
v2: move everything into sdma5.2 code. No reason for this
to be generic at this point.

team: Fix use-after-free when an option instance allocation fails
commit c12296bbecc488623b7d1932080e394d08f3226b upstream.
In \_\_team\_options\_register, team\_options are allocated and appended to
the team's option\_list.
If one option instance allocation fails, the "inst\_rollback" cleanup
path frees the previously allocated options but doesn't remove them from
the team's option\_list.
This leaves dangling pointers that can be dereferenced later by other
parts of the team driver that iterate over options.
This patch fixes the cleanup path to remove the dangling pointers from
the list.
As far as I can tell, this uaf doesn't have much security implications
since it would be fairly hard to exploit (an attacker would need to make
the allocation of that specific small object fail) but it's still nice
to fix.

arm64: mm: Always make sw-dirty PTEs hw-dirty in pte\_modify
commit 3c0696076aad60a2f04c019761921954579e1b0e upstream.
It is currently possible for a userspace application to enter an
infinite page fault loop when using HugeTLB pages implemented with
contiguous PTEs when HAFDBS is not available. This happens because:
1. The kernel may sometimes write PTEs that are sw-dirty but hw-clean
(PTE\_DIRTY | PTE\_RDONLY | PTE\_WRITE).
2. If, during a write, the CPU uses a sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE in handling
the memory access on a system without HAFDBS, we will get a page
fault.
3. HugeTLB will check if it needs to update the dirty bits on the PTE.
For contiguous PTEs, it will check to see if the pgprot bits need
updating. In this case, HugeTLB wants to write a sequence of
sw-dirty, hw-dirty PTEs, but it finds that all the PTEs it is about
to overwrite are all pte\_dirty() (pte\_sw\_dirty() => pte\_dirty()),
so it thinks no update is necessary.
We can get the kernel to write a sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE with the
following steps (showing the relevant VMA flags and pgprot bits):
i. Create a valid, writable contiguous PTE.
VMA vmflags: VM\_SHARED | VM\_READ | VM\_WRITE
VMA pgprot bits: PTE\_RDONLY | PTE\_WRITE
PTE pgprot bits: PTE\_DIRTY | PTE\_WRITE
ii. mprotect the VMA to PROT\_NONE.
VMA vmflags: VM\_SHARED
VMA pgprot bits: PTE\_RDONLY
PTE pgprot bits: PTE\_DIRTY | PTE\_RDONLY
iii. mprotect the VMA back to PROT\_READ | PROT\_WRITE.
VMA vmflags: VM\_SHARED | VM\_READ | VM\_WRITE
VMA pgprot bits: PTE\_RDONLY | PTE\_WRITE
PTE pgprot bits: PTE\_DIRTY | PTE\_WRITE | PTE\_RDONLY
Make it impossible to create a writeable sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE with
pte\_modify(). Such a PTE should be impossible to create, and there may
be places that assume that pte\_dirty() implies pte\_hw\_dirty().

Revert "selftests: error out if kernel header files are not yet built"
commit 43e8832fed08438e2a27afed9bac21acd0ceffe5 upstream.
This reverts commit 9fc96c7c19df ("selftests: error out if kernel header
files are not yet built").
It turns out that requiring the kernel headers to be built as a
prerequisite to building selftests, does not work in many cases. For
example, Peter Zijlstra writes:
"My biggest beef with the whole thing is that I simply do not want to use
'make headers', it doesn't work for me.
I have a ton of output directories and I don't care to build tools into
the output dirs, in fact some of them flat out refuse to work that way
(bpf comes to mind)." [1]
Therefore, stop erroring out on the selftests build. Additional patches
will be required in order to change over to not requiring the kernel
headers.

ext4: prevent the normalized size from exceeding EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS
commit 2dcf5fde6dffb312a4bfb8ef940cea2d1f402e32 upstream.
For files with logical blocks close to EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS, the file size
predicted in ext4\_mb\_normalize\_request() may exceed EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS.
This can cause some blocks to be preallocated that will not be used.
And after [Fixes], the following issue may be triggered:

ex.fe\_logical = orig\_goal\_end - EXT4\_C2B(sbi, ex.fe\_len);

The problem is that when orig\_goal\_end is subtracted from ac\_b\_ex.fe\_len
it is still greater than EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS, which causes ex.fe\_logical to
overflow to a very small value, which ultimately triggers a BUG\_ON in
ext4\_mb\_new\_inode\_pa() because pa->pa\_free < len.
The last logical block of an actual write request does not exceed
EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS, so in ext4\_mb\_normalize\_request() also avoids normalizing
the last logical block to exceed EXT\_MAX\_BLOCKS to avoid the above issue.
The test case in [Link] can reproduce the above issue with 64k block size.

If bus is marked as multi\_link, but number of masters in the stream is

bus->hw\_sync\_min\_links), bank switching should not happen. The first
part of do\_bank\_switch() code properly takes these conditions into
account, but second part (sdw\_ml\_sync\_bank\_switch()) relies purely on
bus->multi\_link property. This is not balanced and leads to NULL
pointer dereference:

cxl/hdm: Fix dpa translation locking
commit 6f5c4eca48ffe18307b4e1d375817691c9005c87 upstream.
The helper, cxl\_dpa\_resource\_start(), snapshots the dpa-address of an
endpoint-decoder after acquiring the cxl\_dpa\_rwsem. However, it is
sufficient to assert that cxl\_dpa\_rwsem is held rather than acquire it
in the helper. Otherwise, it triggers multiple lockdep reports:
1/ Tracing callbacks are in an atomic context that can not acquire sleeping
locks:

Our btrfs subvolume snapshot   utility enforces
that  is the root of the subvolume, however this isn't enforced
in the kernel. Update the kernel to also enforce this limitation to
avoid problems with other users of this ioctl that don't have the

perf: Fix perf\_event\_validate\_size() lockdep splat
commit 7e2c1e4b34f07d9aa8937fab88359d4a0fce468e upstream.
When lockdep is enabled, the for\_each\_sibling\_event(sibling, event)
macro checks that event->ctx->mutex is held. When creating a new group
leader event, we call perf\_event\_validate\_size() on a partially
initialized event where event->ctx is NULL, and so when
for\_each\_sibling\_event() attempts to check event->ctx->mutex, we get a
splat, as reported by Lucas De Marchi:
WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 1471 at kernel/events/core.c:1950 \_\_do\_sys\_perf\_event\_open+0xf37/0x1080
This only happens for a new event which is its own group\_leader, and in
this case there cannot be any sibling events. Thus it's safe to skip the
check for siblings, which avoids having to make invasive and ugly
changes to for\_each\_sibling\_event().
Avoid the splat by bailing out early when the new event is its own
group\_leader.

arm64: add dependency between vmlinuz.efi and Image
[ Upstream commit c0a8574204054effad6ac83cc75c02576e2985fe ]
A common issue in Makefile is a race in parallel building.
You need to be careful to prevent multiple threads from writing to the
same file simultaneously.
Commit 3939f3345050 ("ARM: 8418/1: add boot image dependencies to not
generate invalid images") addressed such a bad scenario.
A similar symptom occurs with the following command:
$ make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm64 Image vmlinuz.efi
[ snip ]
SORTTAB vmlinux
OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/Image
OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/Image
AS arch/arm64/boot/zboot-header.o
PAD arch/arm64/boot/vmlinux.bin
GZIP arch/arm64/boot/vmlinuz
OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/vmlinuz.o
LD arch/arm64/boot/vmlinuz.efi.elf
OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/vmlinuz.efi
The log "OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/Image" is displayed twice.
It indicates that two threads simultaneously enter arch/arm64/boot/
and write to arch/arm64/boot/Image.
It occasionally leads to a build failure:
$ make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm64 Image vmlinuz.efi
[ snip ]
SORTTAB vmlinux
OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/Image
PAD arch/arm64/boot/vmlinux.bin

asm-generic: qspinlock: fix queued\_spin\_value\_unlocked() implementation
[ Upstream commit 125b0bb95dd6bec81b806b997a4ccb026eeecf8f ]
We really don't want to do atomic\_read() or anything like that, since we
already have the value, not the lock. The whole point of this is that
we've loaded the lock from memory, and we want to check whether the
value we loaded was a locked one or not.
The main use of this is the lockref code, which loads both the lock and
the reference count in one atomic operation, and then works on that
combined value. With the atomic\_read(), the compiler would pointlessly
spill the value to the stack, in order to then be able to read it back
"atomically".
This is the qspinlock version of commit c6f4a9002252 ("asm-generic:
ticket-lock: Optimize arch\_spin\_value\_unlocked()") which fixed this same
bug for ticket locks.

For some unknown reason the regular expression for checkstack only matches
three digit numbers starting with the number "3", or any higher
number. Which means that it skips any stack sizes smaller than 304
bytes. This makes the checkstack script a bit less useful than it could be.
Change the script to match any number. To be filtered out stack sizes
can be configured with the min\_stack variable, which omits any stack
frame sizes smaller than 100 bytes by default.

feature in mt\_set\_input\_mode for such device.
The touchpad reports as BLTP7853, which cannot retrive any useful manufacture
information on the internel by this string at present. As the serial number of
the laptop is GLO-G52, while DMI info reports the laptop serial number as

before entering a suspended state and reset it back to a default
brightness level after the resume:
this has the effect of having the kernel report wrong brightness
status after a sleep, and on some devices (like the Asus RC71L) that
brightness is the intensity of LEDs directly facing the user.

HID: glorious: fix Glorious Model I HID report
[ Upstream commit a5e913c25b6b2b6ae02acef6d9400645ac03dfdf ]
The Glorious Model I mouse has a buggy HID report descriptor for its
keyboard endpoint (used for programmable buttons). For report ID 2, there
is a mismatch between Logical Minimum and Usage Minimum in the array that
reports keycodes.
The offending portion of the descriptor: (from hid-decode)
0x95, 0x05, // Report Count (5) 30
0x75, 0x08, // Report Size (8) 32
0x15, 0x00, // Logical Minimum (0) 34
0x25, 0x65, // Logical Maximum (101) 36
0x05, 0x07, // Usage Page (Keyboard) 38
0x19, 0x01, // Usage Minimum (1) 40
0x29, 0x65, // Usage Maximum (101) 42
0x81, 0x00, // Input (Data,Arr,Abs) 44
This bug shifts all programmed keycodes up by 1. Importantly, this causes
"empty" array indexes of 0x00 to be interpreted as 0x01, ErrorRollOver.
The presence of ErrorRollOver causes the system to ignore all keypresses
from the endpoint and breaks the ability to use the programmable buttons.
Setting byte 41 to 0x00 fixes this, and causes keycodes to be interpreted
correctly.
Also, USB\_VENDOR\_ID\_GLORIOUS is changed to USB\_VENDOR\_ID\_SINOWEALTH,
and a new ID for Laview Technology is added. Glorious seems to be
white-labeling controller boards or mice from these vendors. There isn't a
single canonical vendor ID for Glorious products.

HID: mcp2221: Allow IO to start during probe
[ Upstream commit 73ce9f1f2741a38f5d27393e627702ae2c46e6f2 ]
During the probe we add an I2C adapter and as soon as we add that adapter
it may be used for a transfer (e.g via the code in i2cdetect()).
Those transfers are not able to complete and time out. This is because the
HID raw\_event callback (mcp2221\_raw\_event) will not be invoked until the
HID device's 'driver\_input\_lock' is marked up at the completion of the
probe in hid\_device\_probe(). This starves the driver of the responses it
is waiting for.
In order to allow the I2C transfers to complete while we are still in the
probe, start the IO once we have completed init of the HID device.
This issue seems to have been seen before and a patch was submitted but
it seems it was never accepted. See:

LoongArch: Silence the boot warning about 'nokaslr'
[ Upstream commit 902d75cdf0cf0a3fb58550089ee519abf12566f5 ]
The kernel parameter 'nokaslr' is handled before start\_kernel(), so we
don't need early\_param() to mark it technically. But it can cause a boot
warning as follows:
Unknown kernel command line parameters "nokaslr", will be passed to user space.
When we use 'init=/bin/bash', 'nokaslr' which passed to user space will
even cause a kernel panic. So we use early\_param() to mark 'nokaslr',
simply print a notice and silence the boot warning (also fix a potential
panic). This logic is similar to RISC-V.

LoongArch: Add dependency between vmlinuz.efi and vmlinux.efi
[ Upstream commit d3ec75bc635cb0cb8185b63293d33a3d1b942d22 ]
A common issue in Makefile is a race in parallel building.
You need to be careful to prevent multiple threads from writing to the
same file simultaneously.
Commit 3939f3345050 ("ARM: 8418/1: add boot image dependencies to not

A similar symptom occurs with the following command:
$ make -j$(nproc) ARCH=loongarch vmlinux.efi vmlinuz.efi

SORTTAB vmlinux
OBJCOPY arch/loongarch/boot/vmlinux.efi

The log "OBJCOPY arch/loongarch/boot/vmlinux.efi" is displayed twice.
It indicates that two threads simultaneously enter arch/loongarch/boot/

It occasionally leads to a build failure:

selftests/bpf: fix bpf\_loop\_bench for new callback verification scheme
[ Upstream commit f40bfd1679446b22d321e64a1fa98b7d07d2be08 ]
This is a preparatory change. A follow-up patch "bpf: verify callbacks
as if they are called unknown number of times" changes logic for
callbacks handling. While previously callbacks were verified as a
single function call, new scheme takes into account that callbacks
could be executed unknown number of times.
This has dire implications for bpf\_loop\_bench:
SEC("fentry/" SYS\_PREFIX "sys\_getpgid")
int benchmark(void \*ctx)
{
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
bpf\_loop(nr\_loops, empty\_callback, NULL, 0);
\_\_sync\_add\_and\_fetch(&hits, nr\_loops);
}
return 0;
}
W/o callbacks change verifier sees it as a 1000 calls to
empty\_callback(). However, with callbacks change things become
exponential:
- i=0: state exploring empty\_callback is scheduled with i=0 (a);
- i=1: state exploring empty\_callback is scheduled with i=1;
...
- i=999: state exploring empty\_callback is scheduled with i=999;
- state (a) is popped from stack;
- i=1: state exploring empty\_callback is scheduled with i=1;
...
Avoid this issue by rewriting outer loop as bpf\_loop().
Unfortunately, this adds a function call to a loop at runtime, which
negatively affects performance:
throughput latency
before: 149.919 Â± 0.168 M ops/s, 6.670 ns/op
after : 137.040 Â± 0.187 M ops/s, 7.297 ns/op

bcache: avoid oversize memory allocation by small stripe\_size
[ Upstream commit baf8fb7e0e5ec54ea0839f0c534f2cdcd79bea9c ]
Arraies bcache->stripe\_sectors\_dirty and bcache->full\_dirty\_stripes are
used for dirty data writeback, their sizes are decided by backing device
capacity and stripe size. Larger backing device capacity or smaller
stripe size make these two arraies occupies more dynamic memory space.
Currently bcache->stripe\_size is directly inherited from
queue->limits.io\_opt of underlying storage device. For normal hard
drives, its limits.io\_opt is 0, and bcache sets the corresponding
stripe\_size to 1TB (1<<31 sectors), it works fine 10+ years. But for
devices do declare value for queue->limits.io\_opt, small stripe\_size
(comparing to 1TB) becomes an issue for oversize memory allocations of
bcache->stripe\_sectors\_dirty and bcache->full\_dirty\_stripes, while the
capacity of hard drives gets much larger in recent decade.
For example a raid5 array assembled by three 20TB hardrives, the raid
device capacity is 40TB with typical 512KB limits.io\_opt. After the math
calculation in bcache code, these two arraies will occupy 400MB dynamic
memory. Even worse Andrea Tomassetti reports that a 4KB limits.io\_opt is
declared on a new 2TB hard drive, then these two arraies request 2GB and
512MB dynamic memory from kzalloc(). The result is that bcache device
always fails to initialize on his system.
To avoid the oversize memory allocation, bcache->stripe\_size should not
directly inherited by queue->limits.io\_opt from the underlying device.
This patch defines BCH\_MIN\_STRIPE\_SZ (4MB) as minimal bcache stripe size
and set bcache device's stripe size against the declared limits.io\_opt
value from the underlying storage device,
- If the declared limits.io\_opt > BCH\_MIN\_STRIPE\_SZ, bcache device will
set its stripe size directly by this limits.io\_opt value.
- If the declared limits.io\_opt < BCH\_MIN\_STRIPE\_SZ, bcache device will
set its stripe size by a value multiplying limits.io\_opt and euqal or
large than BCH\_MIN\_STRIPE\_SZ.
Then the minimal stripe size of a bcache device will always be >= 4MB.
For a 40TB raid5 device with 512KB limits.io\_opt, memory occupied by
bcache->stripe\_sectors\_dirty and bcache->full\_dirty\_stripes will be 50MB
in total. For a 2TB hard drive with 4KB limits.io\_opt, memory occupied
by these two arraies will be 2.5MB in total.
Such mount of memory allocated for bcache->stripe\_sectors\_dirty and
bcache->full\_dirty\_stripes is reasonable for most of storage devices.

blk-cgroup: bypass blkcg\_deactivate\_policy after destroying

blkcg\_deactivate\_policy() can be called after blkg\_destroy\_all()
returns, and it isn't necessary since blkg\_destroy\_all has covered

Fix some superficial issues with the tracing of rxrpc\_bundle structs,
including:
(1) Set the debug\_id when the bundle is allocated rather than when it is
set up so that the "NEW" trace line displays the correct bundle ID.
(2) Show the refcount when emitting the "FREE" traceline.

usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit
[ Upstream commit ccab434e674ca95d483788b1895a70c21b7f016a ]
If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb\_trim()
as length will wrap around ending up as some very
large value.
The driver will then proceed to parse the header
located at that position, which will either oops or
process some random value.
The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
since the introduction of the driver.

x86/hyperv: Fix the detection of E820\_TYPE\_PRAM in a Gen2 VM
[ Upstream commit 7e8037b099c0bbe8f2109dc452dbcab8d400fc53 ]
A Gen2 VM doesn't support legacy PCI/PCIe, so both raw\_pci\_ops and
raw\_pci\_ext\_ops are NULL, and pci\_subsys\_init() -> pcibios\_init()
doesn't call pcibios\_resource\_survey() -> e820\_\_reserve\_resources\_late();
as a result, any emulated persistent memory of E820\_TYPE\_PRAM (12) via
the kernel parameter memmap=nn[KMG]!ss is not added into iomem\_resource
and hence can't be detected by register\_e820\_pmem().
Fix this by directly calling e820\_\_reserve\_resources\_late() in
hv\_pci\_init(), which is called from arch\_initcall(pci\_arch\_init).
It's ok to move a Gen2 VM's e820\_\_reserve\_resources\_late() from
subsys\_initcall(pci\_subsys\_init) to arch\_initcall(pci\_arch\_init) because
the code in-between doesn't depend on the E820 resources.
e820\_\_reserve\_resources\_late() depends on e820\_\_reserve\_resources(),
which has been called earlier from setup\_arch().
For a Gen-2 VM, the new hv\_pci\_init() also adds any memory of
E820\_TYPE\_PMEM (7) into iomem\_resource, and acpi\_nfit\_register\_region() ->
acpi\_nfit\_insert\_resource() -> region\_intersects() returns
REGION\_INTERSECTS, so the memory of E820\_TYPE\_PMEM won't get added twice.
Changed the local variable "int gen2vm" to "bool gen2vm".

selftests/mm: cow: print ksft header before printing anything else
[ Upstream commit a6fcd57cf2df409d35e9225b8dbad6f937b28df0 ]
Doing a ksft\_print\_msg() before the ksft\_print\_header() seems to confuse
the ksft framework in a strange way: running the test on the cmdline
results in the expected output.
But piping the output somewhere else, results in some odd output,
whereby we repeatedly get the same info printed:

drm/i915: Use internal class when counting engine resets
[ Upstream commit 1f721a93a528268fa97875cff515d1fcb69f4f44 ]
Commit 503579448db9 ("drm/i915/gsc: Mark internal GSC engine with reserved uabi class")
made the GSC0 engine not have a valid uabi class and so broke the engine
reset counting, which in turn was made class based in cb823ed9915b ("drm/i915/gt: Use intel\_gt as the primary object for handling resets").
Despite the title and commit text of the latter is not mentioning it (and
has left the storage array incorrectly sized), tracking by class, despite
it adding aliasing in hypthotetical multi-tile systems, is handy for
virtual engines which for instance do not have a valid engine->id.
Therefore we keep that but just change it to use the internal class which
is always valid. We also add a helper to increment the count, which
aligns with the existing getter.
What was broken without this fix were out of bounds reads every time a
reset would happen on the GSC0 engine, or during selftests when storing
and cross-checking the counts in igt\_live\_test\_begin and
igt\_live\_test\_end.

PCI: vmd: Fix potential deadlock when enabling ASPM
commit 49de0dc87965079a8e2803ee4b39f9d946259423 upstream.
The vmd\_pm\_enable\_quirk() helper is called from pci\_walk\_bus() during

Since pci\_walk\_bus() already holds a pci\_bus\_sem read lock, use

potential deadlock (e.g. in case someone takes a write lock before
reacquiring the read lock).

PCI: loongson: Limit MRRS to 256
commit ef61a0405742a9f7f6051bc6fd2f017d87d07911 upstream.
This is a partial revert of 8b3517f88ff2 ("PCI: loongson: Prevent LS7A MRRS
increases") for MIPS-based Loongson.
Some MIPS Loongson systems don't support arbitrary Max\_Read\_Request\_Size
(MRRS) settings. 8b3517f88ff2 ("PCI: loongson: Prevent LS7A MRRS
increases") worked around that by (1) assuming that firmware configured
MRRS to the maximum supported value and (2) preventing the PCI core from
increasing MRRS.
Unfortunately, some firmware doesn't set that maximum MRRS correctly, which
results in devices not being initialized correctly. One symptom, from the
Debian report below, is this:
ata4.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x20000000 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
ata4.00: failed command: WRITE FPDMA QUEUED
ata4.00: cmd 61/20:e8:00:f0:e1/00:00:00:00:00/40 tag 29 ncq dma 16384 out

ata4.00: status: { DRDY }
ata4: hard resetting link
Limit MRRS to 256 because MIPS Loongson with higher MRRS support is
considered rare.
This must be done at device enablement stage because the MRRS setting may
get lost if PCI\_COMMAND\_MASTER on the parent bridge is cleared, and we are
only sure parent bridge is enabled at this point.

Revert "PCI: acpiphp: Reassign resources on bridge if necessary"

This reverts commit 40613da52b13fb21c5566f10b287e0ca8c12c4e9 and the
subsequent fix to it:
cc22522fd55e ("PCI: acpiphp: Use pci\_assign\_unassigned\_bridge\_resources() only for non-root bus")
40613da52b13 fixed a problem where hot-adding a device with large BARs
failed if the bridge windows programmed by firmware were not large enough.
cc22522fd55e ("PCI: acpiphp: Use pci\_assign\_unassigned\_bridge\_resources()
only for non-root bus") fixed a problem with 40613da52b13: an ACPI hot-add
of a device on a PCI root bus (common in the virt world) or firmware
sending ACPI Bus Check to non-existent Root Ports (e.g., on Dell Inspiron
7352/0W6WV0) caused a NULL pointer dereference and suspend/resume hangs.
Unfortunately the combination of 40613da52b13 and cc22522fd55e caused other
problems:
- Fiona reported that hot-add of SCSI disks in QEMU virtual machine fails
sometimes.
- Dongli reported a similar problem with hot-add of SCSI disks.
- Jonathan reported a console freeze during boot on bare metal due to an
error in radeon GPU initialization.
Revert both patches to avoid adding these problems. This means we will
again see the problems with hot-adding devices with large BARs and the NULL
pointer dereferences and suspend/resume issues that 40613da52b13 and
cc22522fd55e were intended to fix.

commit 315deab289924c83ab1ded50022e8db95d6e428b upstream.
Calling component\_add starts loading the firmware, the callback function
writes the program to the amplifiers. If the module resets the
amplifiers after component\_add, it happens that one of the amplifiers
does not work because the reset and program writing are interleaving.
Call tas2781\_reset before component\_add to ensure reliable
initialization.

io\_uring/cmd: fix breakage in SOCKET\_URING\_OP\_SIOC\* implementation
commit 1ba0e9d69b2000e95267c888cbfa91d823388d47 upstream.
In 8e9fad0e70b7 "io\_uring: Add io\_uring command support for sockets"
you've got an include of asm-generic/ioctls.h done in io\_uring/uring\_cmd.c.
That had been done for the sake of this chunk -
+ ret = prot->ioctl(sk, SIOCINQ, &arg);
+ if (ret)
+ return ret;
+ return arg;
+ case SOCKET\_URING\_OP\_SIOCOUTQ:
+ ret = prot->ioctl(sk, SIOCOUTQ, &arg);
SIOC{IN,OUT}Q are defined to symbols (FIONREAD and TIOCOUTQ) that come from
ioctls.h, all right, but the values vary by the architecture.
FIONREAD is
0x467F on mips
0x4004667F on alpha, powerpc and sparc
0x8004667F on sh and xtensa
0x541B everywhere else
TIOCOUTQ is
0x7472 on mips
0x40047473 on alpha, powerpc and sparc
0x80047473 on sh and xtensa
0x5411 everywhere else
->ioctl() expects the same values it would've gotten from userland; all
places where we compare with SIOC{IN,OUT}Q are using asm/ioctls.h, so
they pick the correct values. io\_uring\_cmd\_sock(), OTOH, ends up
passing the default ones.

fuse: share lookup state between submount and its parent
commit c4d361f66ac91db8fc65061a9671682f61f4ca9d upstream.
Fuse submounts do not perform a lookup for the nodeid that they inherit
from their parent. Instead, the code decrements the nlookup on the
submount's fuse\_inode when it is instantiated, and no forget is
performed when a submount root is evicted.
Trouble arises when the submount's parent is evicted despite the
submount itself being in use. In this author's case, the submount was
in a container and deatched from the initial mount namespace via a
MNT\_DEATCH operation. When memory pressure triggered the shrinker, the
inode from the parent was evicted, which triggered enough forgets to
render the submount's nodeid invalid.
Since submounts should still function, even if their parent goes away,
solve this problem by sharing refcounted state between the parent and
its submount. When all of the references on this shared state reach
zero, it's safe to forget the final lookup of the fuse nodeid.

commit c55e0a55b165202f18cbc4a20650d2e1becd5507 upstream.
Although DIRECT\_IO\_RELAX's initial usage is to allow shared mmap, its
description indicates a purpose of reducing memory footprint. This
may imply that it could be further used to relax other DIRECT\_IO
operations in the future.
Replace it with a flag DIRECT\_IO\_ALLOW\_MMAP which does only one thing,
allow shared mmap of DIRECT\_IO files while still bypassing the cache
on regular reads and writes.

commit a9f68ffe1170ca4bc17ab29067d806a354a026e0 upstream.
Users have reported problems with recent Lenovo laptops that contain
an IDEA5002 I2C HID device. Reports include fans turning on and
running even at idle and spurious wakeups from suspend.
Presumably in the Windows ecosystem there is an application that
uses the HID device. Maybe that puts it into a lower power state so
it doesn't cause spurious events.
This device doesn't serve any functional purpose in Linux as nothing
interacts with it so blacklist it from being probed. This will
prevent the GPIO driver from setting up the GPIO and the spurious
interrupts and wake events will not occur.

[ Upstream commit f24a49a375f65e8e75ee1b19d806f46dbaae57fd ]
Starting with commit 4e51bf44a03a ("net: bridge: move the switchdev
object replay helpers to "push" mode") the switchdev\_bridge\_port\_offload()
helper was extended with the intention to provide switchdev drivers easy
access to object addition and deletion replays. This works by calling
the replay helpers with non-NULL notifier blocks.
In the same commit, the dpaa2-switch driver was updated so that it
passes valid notifier blocks to the helper. At that moment, no
regression was identified through testing.
In the meantime, the blamed commit changed the behavior in terms of
which ports get hit by the replay. Before this commit, only the initial
port which identified itself as offloaded through
switchdev\_bridge\_port\_offload() got a replay of all port objects and
FDBs. After this, the newly joining port will trigger a replay of
objects on all bridge ports and on the bridge itself.
This behavior leads to errors in dpaa2\_switch\_port\_vlans\_add() when a
VLAN gets installed on the same interface multiple times.
The intended mechanism to address this is to pass a non-NULL ctx to the
switchdev\_bridge\_port\_offload() helper and then check it against the
port's private structure. But since the driver does not have any use for
the replayed port objects and FDBs until it gains support for LAG
offload, it's better to fix the issue by reverting the dpaa2-switch
driver to not ask for replay. The pointers will be added back when we
are prepared to ignore replays on unrelated ports.

net: ena: Fix DMA syncing in XDP path when SWIOTLB is on
[ Upstream commit d760117060cf2e90b5c59c5492cab179a4dbce01 ]
This patch fixes two issues:
Issue 1
-------
Description
```````````
Current code does not call dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() to sync data from
the device side memory to the CPU side memory before the XDP code path
uses the CPU side data.
This causes the XDP code path to read the unset garbage data in the CPU
side memory, resulting in incorrect handling of the packet by XDP.
Solution
````````
1. Add a call to dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() before the XDP code starts to
use the data in the CPU side memory.
2. The XDP code verdict can be XDP\_PASS, in which case there is a
fallback to the non-XDP code, which also calls
dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu().
To avoid calling dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() twice:
2.1. Put the dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() in the code in such a place where
it happens before XDP and non-XDP code.
2.2. Remove the calls to dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() in the non-XDP code
for the first buffer only (rx\_copybreak and non-rx\_copybreak
cases), since the new call that was added covers these cases.
The call to dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() for the second buffer and on
stays because only the first buffer is handled by the newly added
dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu(). And there is no need for special
handling of the second buffer and on for the XDP path since
currently the driver supports only single buffer packets.
Issue 2
-------
Description
```````````
In case the XDP code forwarded the packet (ENA\_XDP\_FORWARDED),
ena\_unmap\_rx\_buff\_attrs() is called with attrs set to 0.
This means that before unmapping the buffer, the internal function
dma\_unmap\_page\_attrs() will also call dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() on
the whole buffer (not only on the data part of it).
This sync is both wasteful (since a sync was already explicitly
called before) and also causes a bug, which will be explained
using the below diagram.
The following diagram shows the flow of events causing the bug.
The order of events is (1)-(4) as shown in the diagram.

After the call to ena\_unmap\_rx\_buff\_attrs() in (4), the xdpf->data
becomes corrupted, and so when it is later accessed in
ena\_clean\_xdp\_irq()->xdp\_return\_frame(), it causes a page fault,
crashing the kernel.
Solution
````````
Explicitly tell ena\_unmap\_rx\_buff\_attrs() not to call
dma\_sync\_single\_for\_cpu() by passing it the ENA\_DMA\_ATTR\_SKIP\_CPU\_SYNC
flag.

The panic issue was trigered by tcp simultaneous initiation.
The initiation process is as follows:

2. SYN-SENT -->  ...
3. SYN-RECEIVED <--  <-- SYN-SENT
4. ...  --> SYN-RECEIVED
5. SYN-RECEIVED -->  ...
// TCP B: not send challenge ack for ack limit or packet loss
// TCP A: close
tcp\_close
tcp\_send\_fin

tskb = skb\_rb\_last(&sk->tcp\_rtx\_queue); //pick SYN\_ACK packet
TCP\_SKB\_CB(tskb)->tcp\_flags |= TCPHDR\_FIN; // set FIN flag

\_\_pskb\_trim\_head
skb->data\_len -= len // skb->len=-1, wrap around

If we use tcp\_trim\_head() to remove acked SYN from packet that contains data
or other flags, skb->len will be incorrectly decremented. We can remove SYN
flag that has been acked from rtx\_queue earlier than tcp\_trim\_head(), which
can fix the problem mentioned above.

iavf: Fix iavf\_shutdown to call iavf\_remove instead iavf\_close

iavf\_shutdown was implementing an incomplete version

iavf: Introduce new state machines for flow director
[ Upstream commit 3a0b5a2929fdeda63fc921c2dbed237059acf732 ]
New states introduced:
IAVF\_FDIR\_FLTR\_DIS\_REQUEST
IAVF\_FDIR\_FLTR\_DIS\_PENDING
IAVF\_FDIR\_FLTR\_INACTIVE
Current FDIR state machines (SM) are not adequate to handle a few
scenarios in the link DOWN/UP event, reset event and ntuple-feature.
For example, when VF link goes DOWN and comes back UP administratively,
the expectation is that previously installed filters should also be
restored. But with current SM, filters are not restored.
So with new SM, during link DOWN filters are marked as INACTIVE in
the iavf list but removed from PF. After link UP, SM will transition
from INACTIVE to ADD\_REQUEST to restore the filter.
Similarly, with VF reset, filters will be removed from the PF, but
marked as INACTIVE in the iavf list. Filters will be restored after
reset completion.
Steps to reproduce:
-------------------
1. Create a VF. Here VF is enp8s0.
2. Assign IP addresses to VF and link partner and ping continuously
from remote. Here remote IP is 1.1.1.1.
3. Check default RX Queue of traffic.
ethtool -S enp8s0 | grep -E "rx-[[:digit:]]+\.packets"
4. Add filter - change default RX Queue (to 15 here)
ethtool -U ens8s0 flow-type ip4 src-ip 1.1.1.1 action 15 loc 5
5. Ensure filter gets added and traffic is received on RX queue 15 now.
Link event testing:
-------------------
6. Bring VF link down and up. If traffic flows to configured queue 15,
test is success, otherwise it is a failure.
Reset event testing:
--------------------
7. Reset the VF. If traffic flows to configured queue 15, test is success,
otherwise it is a failure.

octeontx2-pf: Fix promisc mcam entry action
[ Upstream commit dbda436824ded8ef6a05bb82cd9baa8d42377a49 ]
Current implementation is such that, promisc mcam entry action
is set as multicast even when there are no trusted VFs. multicast
action causes the hardware to copy packet data, which reduces
the performance.
This patch fixes this issue by setting the promisc mcam entry action to
unicast instead of multicast when there are no trusted VFs. The same
change is made for the 'allmulti' mcam entry action.

net/sched: act\_ct: Take per-cb reference to tcf\_ct\_flow\_table
[ Upstream commit 125f1c7f26ffcdbf96177abe75b70c1a6ceb17bc ]
The referenced change added custom cleanup code to act\_ct to delete any
callbacks registered on the parent block when deleting the
tcf\_ct\_flow\_table instance. However, the underlying issue is that the
drivers don't obtain the reference to the tcf\_ct\_flow\_table instance when
registering callbacks which means that not only driver callbacks may still
be on the table when deleting it but also that the driver can still have
pointers to its internal nf\_flowtable and can use it concurrently which
results either warning in netfilter[0] or use-after-free.
Fix the issue by taking a reference to the underlying struct
tcf\_ct\_flow\_table instance when registering the callback and release the
reference when unregistering. Expose new API required for such reference
counting by adding two new callbacks to nf\_flowtable\_type and implementing
them for act\_ct flowtable\_ct type. This fixes the issue by extending the
lifetime of nf\_flowtable until all users have unregistered.

octeontx2-af: fix a use-after-free in rvu\_nix\_register\_reporters
[ Upstream commit 28a7cb045ab700de5554193a1642917602787784 ]
The rvu\_dl will be freed in rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_destroy(rvu\_dl)
after the create\_workqueue fails, and after that free, the rvu\_dl will
be translate back through the following call chain:
rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_destroy
|-> rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_create
|-> rvu\_health\_reporters\_create
|-> rvu\_register\_dl (label err\_dl\_health)
Finally. in the err\_dl\_health label, rvu\_dl being freed again in
rvu\_health\_reporters\_destroy(rvu) by rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_destroy.
In the second calls of rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_destroy, however,
it uses rvu\_dl->rvu\_nix\_health\_reporter, which is already freed at
the end of rvu\_nix\_health\_reporters\_destroy in the first call.
So this patch prevents the first destroy by instantly returning -ENONMEN
when create\_workqueue fails. In addition, since the failure of
create\_workqueue is the only entrence of label err, it has been
integrated into the error-handling path of create\_workqueue.

net: fec: correct queue selection

The old implementation extracted VLAN TCI info from the payload
before the VLAN tag has been pushed in the payload.
Another problem was that the VLAN TCI was extracted even if the
packet did not have VLAN protocol header.
This resulted in invalid VLAN TCI and as a consequence a random
queue was computed.
This patch fixes the above issues and use the VLAN TCI from the
skb if it is present or VLAN TCI from payload if present. If no
VLAN header is present queue 0 is selected.

addition, internal loopback packets will never have a valid timestamp

determine if it is a loopback packet or not.

qca\_debug: Prevent crash on TX ring changes
[ Upstream commit f4e6064c97c050bd9904925ff7d53d0c9954fc7b ]
The qca\_spi driver stop and restart the SPI kernel thread
(via ndo\_stop & ndo\_open) in case of TX ring changes. This is
a big issue because it allows userspace to prevent restart of
the SPI kernel thread (via signals). A subsequent change of
TX ring wrongly assume a valid spi\_thread pointer which result
in a crash.
So prevent this by stopping the network traffic handling and
temporary park the SPI thread.

net: ipv6: support reporting otherwise unknown prefix flags in RTM\_NEWPREFIX
[ Upstream commit bd4a816752bab609dd6d65ae021387beb9e2ddbd ]
Lorenzo points out that we effectively clear all unknown
flags from PIO when copying them to userspace in the netlink
RTM\_NEWPREFIX notification.
We could fix this one at a time as new flags are defined,
or in one fell swoop - I choose the latter.
We could either define 6 new reserved flags (reserved1..6) and handle
them individually (and rename them as new flags are defined), or we
could simply copy the entire unmodified byte over - I choose the latter.
This unfortunately requires some anonymous union/struct magic,
so we add a static assert on the struct size for a little extra safety.

net/mlx5e: Check netdev pointer before checking its net ns
[ Upstream commit 7aaf975238c47b710fcc4eca0da1e7902a53abe2 ]
Previously, when comparing the net namespaces, the case where the netdev
doesn't exist wasn't taken into account, and therefore can cause a crash.
In such a case, the comparing function should return false, as there is no
netdev->net to compare the devlink->net to.
Furthermore, this will result in an attempt to enter switchdev mode
without a netdev to fail, and which is the desired result as there is no
meaning in switchdev mode without a net device.

net/mlx5e: Fix possible deadlock on mlx5e\_tx\_timeout\_work
[ Upstream commit eab0da38912ebdad922ed0388209f7eb0a5163cd ]
Due to the cited patch, devlink health commands take devlink lock and
this may result in deadlock for mlx5e\_tx\_reporter as it takes local
state\_lock before calling devlink health report and on the other hand
devlink health commands such as diagnose for same reporter take local
state\_lock after taking devlink lock (see kernel log below).
To fix it, remove local state\_lock from mlx5e\_tx\_timeout\_work() before
calling devlink\_health\_report() and take care to cancel the work before
any call to close channels, which may free the SQs that should be
handled by the work. Before cancel\_work\_sync(), use current\_work() to
check we are not calling it from within the work, as
mlx5e\_tx\_timeout\_work() itself may close the channels and reopen as part
of recovery flow.
While removing state\_lock from mlx5e\_tx\_timeout\_work() keep rtnl\_lock to
ensure no change in netdev->real\_num\_tx\_queues, but use rtnl\_trylock()
and a flag to avoid deadlock by calling cancel\_work\_sync() before
closing the channels while holding rtnl\_lock too.

net/mlx5e: Check the number of elements before walk TC rhashtable
[ Upstream commit 4e25b661f484df54b6751b65f9ea2434a3b67539 ]
After IPSec TX tables are destroyed, the flow rules in TC rhashtable,
which have the destination to IPSec, are restored to the original
one, the uplink.
However, when the device is in switchdev mode and unload driver with
IPSec rules configured, TC rhashtable cleanup is done before IPSec
cleanup, which means tc\_ht->tbl is already freed when walking TC
rhashtable, in order to restore the destination. So add the checking
before walking to avoid unexpected behavior.

net/mlx5e: Reduce eswitch mode\_lock protection context
[ Upstream commit baac8351f74c543896b8fd40138b7ad9365587a3 ]
Currently eswitch mode\_lock is so heavy, for example, it's locked
during the whole process of the mode change, which may need to hold
other locks. As the mode\_lock is also used by IPSec to block mode and
encap change now, it is easy to cause lock dependency.
Since some of protections are also done by devlink lock, the eswitch
mode\_lock is not needed at those places, and thus the possibility of
lockdep issue is reduced.

net/mlx5e: Tidy up IPsec NAT-T SA discovery
[ Upstream commit c2bf84f1d1a1595dcc45fe867f0e02b331993fee ]
IPsec NAT-T packets are UDP encapsulated packets over ESP normal ones.
In case they arrive to RX, the SPI and ESP are located in inner header,
while the check was performed on outer header instead.
That wrong check caused to the situation where received rekeying request
was missed and caused to rekey timeout, which "compensated" this failure
by completing rekeying.

for status flow table as that of ESW, which first of all refines the
code to have less code duplication.
And more importantly, the ESW status table handles IPsec syndrome
checks at steering by HW, which is more efficient than the previous
behaviour we had where it was copied to WQE meta data and checked
by the driver.

net/mlx5e: Ensure that IPsec sequence packet number starts from 1

According to RFC4303, section "3.3.3. Sequence Number Generation",
the first packet sent using a given SA will contain a sequence
number of 1.
However if user didn't set seq/oseq, the HW used zero as first sequence
packet number. Such misconfiguration causes to drop of first packet
if replay window protection was enabled in SA.
To fix it, set sequence number to be at least 1.

Commit 46a0a2c96f0f ("HID: lenovo: Detect quirk-free fw on cptkbd and

TrackPoint Keyboard II which has similar quirks to cptkbd (so it uses
the same workarounds) but slightly different so that there are
false-positives during detecting well-behaving firmware. This commit
restricts detecting well-behaving firmware to the only model which
known to have one and have stable enough quirks to not cause
false-positives.

afs: Fix refcount underflow from error handling race
[ Upstream commit 52bf9f6c09fca8c74388cd41cc24e5d1bff812a9 ]
If an AFS cell that has an unreachable (eg. ENETUNREACH) server listed (VL
server or fileserver), an asynchronous probe to one of its addresses may
fail immediately because sendmsg() returns an error. When this happens, a
refcount underflow can happen if certain events hit a very small window.
The way this occurs is:
(1) There are two levels of "call" object, the afs\_call and the
rxrpc\_call. Each of them can be transitioned to a "completed" state
in the event of success or failure.
(2) Asynchronous afs\_calls are self-referential whilst they are active to
prevent them from evaporating when they're not being processed. This
reference is disposed of when the afs\_call is completed.
Note that an afs\_call may only be completed once; once completed
completing it again will do nothing.
(3) When a call transmission is made, the app-side rxrpc code queues a Tx
buffer for the rxrpc I/O thread to transmit. The I/O thread invokes
sendmsg() to transmit it - and in the case of failure, it transitions
the rxrpc\_call to the completed state.
(4) When an rxrpc\_call is completed, the app layer is notified. In this
case, the app is kafs and it schedules a work item to process events
pertaining to an afs\_call.
(5) When the afs\_call event processor is run, it goes down through the
RPC-specific handler to afs\_extract\_data() to retrieve data from rxrpc
- and, in this case, it picks up the error from the rxrpc\_call and
returns it.
The error is then propagated to the afs\_call and that is completed
too. At this point the self-reference is released.
(6) If the rxrpc I/O thread manages to complete the rxrpc\_call within the
window between rxrpc\_send\_data() queuing the request packet and
checking for call completion on the way out, then
rxrpc\_kernel\_send\_data() will return the error from sendmsg() to the
app.
(7) Then afs\_make\_call() will see an error and will jump to the error
handling path which will attempt to clean up the afs\_call.
(8) The problem comes when the error handling path in afs\_make\_call()
tries to unconditionally drop an async afs\_call's self-reference.
This self-reference, however, may already have been dropped by
afs\_extract\_data() completing the afs\_call
(9) The refcount underflows when we return to afs\_do\_probe\_vlserver() and
that tries to drop its reference on the afs\_call.
Fix this by making afs\_make\_call() attempt to complete the afs\_call rather
than unconditionally putting it. That way, if afs\_extract\_data() manages
to complete the call first, afs\_make\_call() won't do anything.
The bug can be forced by making do\_udp\_sendmsg() return -ENETUNREACH and
sticking an msleep() in rxrpc\_send\_data() after the 'success:' label to
widen the race window.
The error message looks something like:
refcount\_t: underflow; use-after-free.

efi/x86: Avoid physical KASLR on older Dell systems
[ Upstream commit 50d7cdf7a9b1ab6f4f74a69c84e974d5dc0c1bf1 ]
River reports boot hangs with v6.6 and v6.7, and the bisect points to
commit
a1b87d54f4e4 ("x86/efistub: Avoid legacy decompressor when doing EFI boot")
which moves the memory allocation and kernel decompression from the
legacy decompressor (which executes \*after\* ExitBootServices()) to the
EFI stub, using boot services for allocating the memory. The memory
allocation succeeds but the subsequent call to decompress\_kernel() never
returns, resulting in a failed boot and a hanging system.
As it turns out, this issue only occurs when physical address
randomization (KASLR) is enabled, and given that this is a feature we
can live without (virtual KASLR is much more important), let's disable
the physical part of KASLR when booting on AMI UEFI firmware claiming to
implement revision v2.0 of the specification (which was released in
2006), as this is the version these systems advertise.

ext4: fix warning in ext4\_dio\_write\_end\_io()
[ Upstream commit 619f75dae2cf117b1d07f27b046b9ffb071c4685 ]
The syzbot has reported that it can hit the warning in
ext4\_dio\_write\_end\_io() because i\_size < i\_disksize. Indeed the
reproducer creates a race between DIO IO completion and truncate
expanding the file and thus ext4\_dio\_write\_end\_io() sees an inconsistent
inode state where i\_disksize is already updated but i\_size is not
updated yet. Since we are careful when setting up DIO write and consider
it extending (and thus performing the IO synchronously with i\_rwsem held
exclusively) whenever it goes past either of i\_size or i\_disksize, we
can use the same test during IO completion without risking entering
ext4\_handle\_inode\_extension() without i\_rwsem held. This way we make it
obvious both i\_size and i\_disksize are large enough when we report DIO
completion without relying on unreliable WARN\_ON.

    Saleem discovered that improper access control in the Intel Ethernet
    Controller RDMA driver may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-34324

    Marek Marczykowski-Gorecki reported a possible deadlock in the Xen
    guests event channel code which may allow a malicious guest
    administrator to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-35827

    Zheng Wang reported a use-after-free flaw in the Renesas Ethernet
    AVB support driver.

CVE-2023-45863

    A race condition in library routines for handling generic kernel
    objects may result in an out-of-bounds write in the
    fill_kobj_path() function.

CVE-2023-46813

    Tom Dohrmann reported that a race condition in the Secure Encrypted
    Virtualization (SEV) implementation when accessing MMIO registers
    may allow a local attacker in a SEV guest VM to cause a denial of
    service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-46862

    It was discovered that a race condition in the io_uring
    subsystem may result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a
    denial of service.

CVE-2023-51780

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Appletalk subsystem
    may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51782

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Amateur Radio X.25
    PLP (Rose) support may lead to a use-after-free. This module is not
