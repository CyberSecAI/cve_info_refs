{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `make_ftp_cmd` function when handling unexpectedly formatted input text from a client. This occurs due to the handling of quote/backslash semantics.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Improper handling of quote/backslash semantics"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of the vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which can lead to a crash of the ProFTPD service. This crash can cause denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or crafted FTP command sent to the server."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary FTP commands to the ProFTPD server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
   "details": "The vulnerability is located in the `make_ftp_cmd` function, specifically in `src/main.c:862`. The ASAN output shows a heap-buffer-overflow at `0x62100001a320`, where the read operation is performed. This read occurs 0 bytes to the right of a 4640-byte region allocated on the heap. The issue is triggered when the server processes malformed client input with unexpected quote/backslash characters."
