  "CVE-2023-51704": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to group-.*-member messages not being properly escaped on Special:log/rights in MediaWiki.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper escaping of group-.*-member messages in the Special:log/rights interface of MediaWiki. This means that when these messages are displayed, they are not sanitized to remove potentially harmful code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that an attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript) into the Special:log/rights page. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser session.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to use the  `$wgUseXssLanguage = true` configuration and inject a malicious message via MediaWiki message overrides.",
       "The attacker needs to append `&uselang=x-xss` to the URL to trigger message overrides in the MediaWiki namespace."

    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to modify MediaWiki messages with malicious JavaScript. The attacker would also need to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL.",
