- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MOKOSmart MKGW1 Gateway does not implement proper session management. Instead of issuing session IDs, the device sets a global server-side "logged in" state for 3600 seconds after successful authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper session management, lack of proper authentication after the initial login on the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network can gain administrative access to the device, read and modify configurations, and potentially gain access to the victim's network by extracting network credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on the same network as the MOKOSmart MKGW1 Gateway can access the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the MOKOSmart MKGW1 gateway and have access to the management network.
