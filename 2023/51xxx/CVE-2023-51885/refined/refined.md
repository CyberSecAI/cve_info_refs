Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51885:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking when handling LaTeX input strings in `mathtex`. Specifically, when processing the input, the software copies the provided LaTeX string into a global buffer `exprbuffer` and then into a stack buffer `hashexpr` without ensuring the input's length does not exceed the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Global-buffer-overflow:** When the input LaTeX string exceeds 32768 bytes, a global buffer overflow occurs while copying data into the `exprbuffer`.
- **Stack-overflow:** The same oversized LaTeX string is then copied to the `hashexpr` buffer on the stack which also does not have sufficient capacity causing a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Command Execution:** The overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions, allowing for potential arbitrary code execution. The blog post mentions that this results in command execution, although the specific mechanism is not detailed here.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflows can lead to program crashes and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted LaTeX Input:** An attacker provides an input string to the `mathtex` program that is greater than 32768 bytes.
- **CLI Mode:**  This can be achieved when running mathtex in CLI mode, passing the oversized string as an argument via `xargs`.
- **CGI Mode:**  The vulnerability is also present in CGI mode if the HTTP server allows URLs longer than 32768 bytes, enabling exploitation through a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted input string to the mathtex application. This can be achieved by:
    - Executing the `mathtex` binary with the crafted input via CLI.
    - Sending an HTTP request with the crafted input as part of the query string when using it as a CGI script.

**Additional Notes:**

- The blog post provides a more detailed view of the vulnerability than the CVE description.
- The `exprbuffer` is a global variable, while `hashexpr` is a stack buffer.
- The vulnerability is present in mathtex version 1.05 and earlier.
