- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Ultimate Addons for WPBakery Page Builder plugin does not properly validate requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the trust a website has in a user's browser. The attacker crafts a malicious link or website which, when visited by an authenticated user, can send unauthorized requests to the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
