- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow occurs while parsing specially crafted CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious CGM file with the affected applications (Teamcenter Visualization or JT2Go).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file. No special privileges are required.
