{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The application's network requests are configured to bypass server certificate verification.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `rejectUnauthorized` attribute in HTTPS connections is set to `false` which disables certificate validation. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks as the client doesn't verify the server's identity.",
        "Use of insecure TLS versions like SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1, which are known to have security vulnerabilities and expose the application to potential risks.",
	"Use of insecure HMAC algorithm: HMAC-MD5, which is susceptible to exhaustive searches and brute force attacks."
      ],
      "impact": "Bypassing certificate verification allows attackers to intercept and manipulate network traffic, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, or unauthorized access to the application.",
      "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks on network connections.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to intercept and manipulate traffic. Or, the attacker can act as a malicious server impersonating a legitimate server."
