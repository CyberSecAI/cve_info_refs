Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function within the `httpd` binary located in the `/bin` directory of the Tenda M3 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack overflow: The `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function does not properly validate the length of input, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload in the `Cookie` header, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and redirect execution flow to arbitrary code, potentially gaining a shell on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP request to any URL on the router.
- Specifically, a crafted cookie within the HTTP request is used to overflow the stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the router.
- HTTP request crafting: The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request and modify the cookie header.

**Technical details:**
- The provided Python script demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The overflow occurs by crafting a specific cookie (`bLanguage`) with a payload of 'a'*0x1c8 + the return address. The value `0x469FC` is the address of the shellcode.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via a POST request to any URI on the router.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable firmware version is V1.0.0.12(4856).
- The vendor is Tenda.
- The exploit author is GD@hillstone.
