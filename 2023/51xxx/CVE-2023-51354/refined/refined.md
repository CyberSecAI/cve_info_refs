- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Webba Booking plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, executes unintended actions in the plugin. This typically involves tricking a user into clicking a link or loading a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, and needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request.
