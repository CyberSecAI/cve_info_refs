Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "search" parameter within the "users" module of the EasyDiscuss component for Joomla. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection. The vulnerability exists in the search functionality of the users module.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "search" parameter, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **SQL Error Messages:** The application outputs SQL error messages when the injected payload breaks the query, which can aid attackers in crafting effective SQLi payloads.
*   **Time-Based Blind Injection:** The vulnerability is time-based, where the attacker can use sleep commands to confirm successful injection and extract data through time delays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the Blind SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user credentials, personal data, or other sensitive application data.
*  **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation or complete system compromise, depending on the database access and the system's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely via a crafted HTTP request.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request with a malicious payload injected into the "search" parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla instance running the EasyDiscuss component.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it accessible to unauthenticated remote attackers.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft specific payloads for data extraction.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability is present in EasyDiscuss v5.0.5.
*   The fix is to upgrade to a version >= 5.0.10.
*   Versions 5.0.6-5.0.9 were not tested due to lack of publicly available source code.
*   The server doubles the sleep time introduced by the injected payload.
