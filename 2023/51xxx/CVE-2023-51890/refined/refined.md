- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `calendar` function in mathtex can be triggered to enter an infinite loop when processing a specific input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Infinite loop vulnerability, leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted input string containing `\calendara` to the mathtex server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be able to send requests to the mathtex server, either through a web interface or by directly calling the executable.
