Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The MCMS (MingSoft Content Management System) uses Freemarker as its view framework. If malicious code is present in the template files during rendering, it can lead to command execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted template upload:** The system allows uploading new templates as ZIP archives.
*   **Freemarker template injection:**  The uploaded templates are processed by the Freemarker template engine. This allows an attacker to insert malicious code within the templates.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate template content, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The provided exploit demonstrated this by launching a calculator application ("calc").
*   **Data breach:** If the application has access to sensitive data, an attacker could steal this data.
*   **System compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the server, install malware, create backdoors, etc.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious ZIP upload:** The attacker creates a ZIP archive containing a template file with malicious Freemarker code.
*   **Template upload via admin panel:** The attacker uses the MCMS admin panel (`系统设置>模板管理>上传模板ZIP压缩包`) to upload the malicious ZIP archive.
*   **Template activation via admin panel:**  The attacker activates the newly uploaded template (`系统设置>应用设置` to set the site style)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Admin access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the template management and application settings in MCMS.
*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload ZIP archives.
*   **Understanding of Freemarker syntax:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious Freemarker template code.
