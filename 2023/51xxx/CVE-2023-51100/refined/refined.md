{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An HTTP request parameter is used in command string construction within the handler function of the formGetDiagnoseInfo route.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection via Shell Metacharacters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router can be made to execute arbitrary shell commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/getDiagnoseInfo` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `cmdinput` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router, and have a valid cookie (e.g. w9v1_user=admin)"
