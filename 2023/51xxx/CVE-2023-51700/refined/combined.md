# WordPress Database Deserialization: Potential for Object Injection

Moderate

[jamieblomerus](/jamieblomerus)
published
GHSA-pqwp-qrp7-grg4
Dec 26, 2023

## Package

WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration
(WordPress)

## Affected versions

< 1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability is classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability (CWE-502), specifically impacting scenarios where an attacker can manipulate the database. Users who have environments where database access is strictly controlled and limited to trusted entities are less likely to be impacted. However, if unauthorized actors gain access to the database, they could exploit this vulnerability to execute object injection attacks. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, or data exfiltration within the WordPress environment.

### Patches

Yes, the problem has been patched. Users of the plugin should upgrade to version 1.0.1 (or later), where the serialization and deserialization of OrderResponse objects have been switched out to an array stored as JSON.

### Workarounds

A possible workaround for users unable to upgrade immediately is to enforce stricter access controls on the database, ensuring that only trusted and authorized entities can modify data. Additionally, implementing monitoring tools to detect unusual database activities could help identify and mitigate potential exploitation attempts.

**It's important to note, however, that these measures are only temporary and do not replace the need for updating to a patched version of the plugin.**

### References
