Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51700:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data retrieved from the WordPress database. Specifically, the `WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration` plugin was using `unserialize()` on the `response` field stored in the database, which was an object of type `Dimafe6\BankID\Model\OrderResponse`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin deserializes data retrieved from the database without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects into the database. When these objects are subsequently deserialized, it can lead to arbitrary code execution through object injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the WordPress site.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify data within the WordPress database.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data stored within the WordPress environment could be accessed and exfiltrated by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the database. An attacker would need to gain access to the database to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the WordPress database to insert malicious serialized data.
*   **High Privileges:** Exploitation requires high privileges within the database environment.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin prior to 1.0.1.
* The patch involves switching from serializing the `OrderResponse` objects using PHP's `serialize()` to storing them as JSON arrays. The plugin also includes validation of the JSON to prevent injection of malicious strings during unserialize.
*   The CVSS score is 6.4 with an attack vector of Local, Attack Complexity High, and Privileges Required High. This is because the attacker needs access to the database to trigger the exploit.
*   The provided information is more detailed than what is generally provided in a basic CVE description.
