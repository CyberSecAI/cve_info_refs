{
  "CVE-2023-51886": {
    "Root cause": "Global buffer overflow in the `main()` function when using `\\convertpath`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `convertpath` buffer is only 256 bytes long, leading to an overflow when the input string exceeds this limit."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to the global buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By providing a specially crafted input string containing `\\convertpath` with a long argument."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the mathtex application, either through web CGI or command line."
  }
}
