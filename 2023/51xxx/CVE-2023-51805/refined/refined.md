Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-51805.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FormDataMysqlService.java` file's `search` method directly concatenates the `formKey` parameter from the request into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization on the `formKey` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this example, the attacker uses `updatexml` to display the `user()` database function, demonstrating the ability to execute SQL.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can send a crafted POST request to the `/user/form/data/query` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `formKey` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account and must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They need to obtain a valid token after login.
