PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC IPC (Industrial PC) is the hardware platform for PC-based automation from Siemens.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-51438

In default installations of maxView Storage Manager where Redfish® server is configured for remote
system management, a vulnerability has been identified that can provide unauthorized access.
