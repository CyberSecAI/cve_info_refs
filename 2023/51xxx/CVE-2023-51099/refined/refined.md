The provided content is related to CVE-2023-51099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in the `formexeCommand` route. Specifically, the HTTP request parameter `cmdinput` is directly used in the construction of a command string without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the affected device.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary shell commands on the router.
- In this example, the attacker launches a telnet daemon on port 2225.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `http://192.168.0.254/goform/exeCommand` endpoint.
- The `cmdinput` parameter contains shell metacharacters (e.g., backticks `) to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, implying that they are likely on the same network as the router or have the ability to route to the router's network.
- Requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/exeCommand`) and the vulnerable parameter (`cmdinput`).
- Requires valid session cookie (`w9v1_user=admin`).
