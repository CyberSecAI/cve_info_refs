The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `StrSplitter.splitByRegex` function of the `hutool-core` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs when the `StrSplitter.splitByRegex` function is called with an empty string as both the input string and the regex. This leads to either an infinite loop causing a `StackOverflowError` or excessive memory allocation causing an `OutOfMemoryError` depending on the `isTrim` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite Loop: When `isTrim` is true, the code enters an infinite loop.
- Excessive memory allocation: When `isTrim` is false, the code will cause a memory exhaustion error due to unbounded growth of an ArrayList.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The vulnerability can cause the application to crash due to either a `StackOverflowError` or an `OutOfMemoryError`. This can lead to service unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific API call `StrSplitter.splitByRegex("", "", 0, false, true)` or `StrSplitter.splitByRegex("", "", 0, false, false)`. Any user or system component capable of calling this function with these specific parameters can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input parameters to the `StrSplitter.splitByRegex` function. This means that the attacker must be able to call this function, directly or indirectly, with the vulnerable parameters.
