**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting a missing authentication or authorization check in the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable function within the plugin.  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
