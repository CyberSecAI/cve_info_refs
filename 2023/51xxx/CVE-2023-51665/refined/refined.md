Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51665:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `/auth/openid/config` API endpoint in `Auth.js`. This endpoint fetches OpenID configuration data from a provided `issuer` URL.  Prior to the patch, this endpoint was accessible without authentication, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL as the issuer, leading to an unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/auth/openid/config` endpoint did not require authentication in vulnerable versions.
- **Blind SSRF:** The server makes a request to the provided URL, but the response isn't directly returned to the attacker. The attacker can only infer if the request was successful.
- **Lack of URL Validation:** Although there is some URL validation added in the patch, the main issue was the lack of any authentication check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could make the server send requests to internal services, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- This is considered a "blind" SSRF, so the attacker doesn't directly receive the response from the server's request. The impact is limited to interactions that can be inferred without the full response (e.g., if a service responds, if it times out, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the `/auth/openid/config` endpoint, including the attacker controlled 'issuer' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The patch commit (7284960) addresses this issue by:
  - Adding an authentication check via `this.isAuthenticated` to the `/auth/openid/config` endpoint, requiring the user to be an admin to access it.
  - Adding checks to validate the provided URL and prevent paths other than `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

- The vulnerability was present in version 2.6.0 and patched in version 2.7.0 of Audiobookshelf.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
