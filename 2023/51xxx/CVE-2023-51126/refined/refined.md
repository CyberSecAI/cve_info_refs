{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The FLIR AX8, up to version 1.46.16, is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability exists in the `/usr/www/res.php` file. The `value` parameter is directly used in a command execution without proper input validation or sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be performed remotely through a network connection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `/usr/www/res.php` endpoint and manipulate the `value` parameter."
