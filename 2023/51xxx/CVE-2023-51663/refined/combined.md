# Hail Batch relies on OIDC email claims to verify the validity of a user's domain.

Moderate

[danking](/danking)

GHSA-487p-qx68-5vjw
Dec 29, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<0.2.127

## Patched versions

0.2.127

## Description

### Impact

All Hail Batch clusters are affected. An attacker is able to:

1. Create one or more accounts with Hail Batch without corresponding real accounts in the organization.

For example, a user could create a Microsoft or Google account and then change their email to "inconspicuous@example.org". This Microsoft or Google account can then be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is "example.org".

In Google, this attack is partially mitigated because Google requires users to verify ownership of their Google account. However, a valid user is able to create multiple distinct Hail Batch accounts by creating multiple distinct Google accounts using email addresses of the form "real\_user\_email\_name+random\_id@example.org".

In Microsoft, this attack requires Azure AD Administrator access to an Azure AD Tenant. The Azure AD Administrator is permitted to change the email address of an account to any other email address without verification. An attacker can create an Azure Tenant for free.

1. The attacker *does not* have access to any private data (because the new service principals or service accounts are not granted any privileges).
2. If trial Hail Batch billing projects are enabled, the attacker *does* have the ability to run jobs and thus spend money. An attacker can create as many accounts as Microsoft or Google permit.
3. The attacker *cannot* impersonate another user because, in Azure, we use the `sub` from the OAuth2 response, and, in Google, Google does an email verification.

### Remediation

1. Apply this patch to prevent third-party attackers from creating accounts.
2. Audit your users list <https://auth.example.org/users> for user accounts whose login ids are not valid login ids with your identity provider. Delete such users.

A forthcoming change will prevent users from creating multiple accounts using Google's `+` email redirection.

### Workarounds

None.

[1] Hail Batch must separately stop using emails and start using the OAuth2 `sub` in Google. This is a known deficiency. In particular, if an email is re-used by the organization for a new user, the new user could access the old user's Hail Batch account.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
