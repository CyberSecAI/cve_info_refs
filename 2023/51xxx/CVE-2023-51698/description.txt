Atril is a simple multi-page document viewer. Atril is vulnerable to a critical Command Injection Vulnerability. This vulnerability gives the attacker immediate access to the target system when the target user opens a crafted document or clicks on a crafted link/URL using a maliciously crafted CBT document which is a TAR archive. A patch is available at commit ce41df6.
