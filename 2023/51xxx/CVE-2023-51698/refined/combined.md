## Description

### Summary

A Critical One-Click RCE/Command Injection Vulnerability Affecting Popular Linux Operating Systems with MATE, Cinnamon, and some Xfce desktop Environments.

Affected Operating Systems:

Kali Linux (Popular OS among Security professionals, researchers)

Parrot OS (Popular OS among Security professionals, researchers)

Ubuntu-Mate

Xubuntu

Fedora Cinnamon

Fedora Mate

Manjaro Mate

Manjaro Cinnamon

Ubuntu Kylin (Official Chinese Ubuntu)

Kylin OS V10 ( OS said to be used in the Chinese Government Sectors )

And other MATE, Cinnamon, and some Xfce desktop Environments.

Affected Software Component: All versions including the latest versions of Atril Document Viewer (Default Doc reader for MATE environment, one of the popular doc readers).

Vulnerability Summary:

This is a one-click Remote Command Execution vulnerability that gives the attacker immediate access to the target system when the target user opens a crafted document or clicks on a crafted link/URL.

This vulnerability is due to a bad code segment in Atril responsible for handling comic book documents (.cbr, .cbz, .cbt, .cb7). Comic book documents are just archives that contain images in it. The vulnerability here can be exploited using a maliciously crafted CBT document which is a TAR archive.

Root Cause - Vulnerable Code segment in both doc viewers (comics-document.c):

```
static const ComicBookDecompressCommand command_usage_def[] = {
        /* RARLABS unrar */
	{"%s p -c- -ierr --", "%s vb -c- -- %s", NULL             , FALSE, NO_OFFSET},

        /* GNA! unrar */
	{NULL               , "%s t %s"        , "%s -xf %s %s"   , FALSE, NO_OFFSET},

        /* unzip */
	{"%s -p -C --"      , "%s %s"          , NULL             , TRUE , OFFSET_ZIP},

        /* 7zip */
	{NULL               , "%s l -- %s"     , "%s x -y %s -o%s", FALSE, OFFSET_7Z},

        /* tar */
	{"%s -xOf"          , "%s -tf %s"      , NULL             , FALSE, NO_OFFSET},

	/* UNARCHIVER */
	{"unar -o -"	    , "%s %s"	       , NULL		  , FALSE, NO_OFFSET}
};

```

By looking at the above code, we can see that there are shell commands used for decompression. Look at the /\* tar \*/ section, it actually calls the following shell command, "tar -xOf -tf ![]()". This is to view/load each image inside the CBT document. This behavior can be exploited by using an option of tar program '--checkpoint-action' to execute arbitrary commands on the target by naming one of the images inside the CBT document to something like '--checkpoint-action=EXEC=bash -c "whoami>/tmp/who.txt";.jpg'.

This vulnerability was already found in Evince Document viewer (the default Doc reader of GNOME) back in 2017. Since Atril is a fork of Evince, this vulnerability was present in Atril. Atril's team fixed the vulnerability at that time by adding a piece of code that quits Atril's process if the CBT file with "--checkpoint-action=" in its name. The following was the patch (comics-document.c) (line - 983):

```
extract_argv (EvDocument *document, gint page)
{
	ComicsDocument *comics_document = COMICS_DOCUMENT (document);
	char **argv;
	char *command_line, *quoted_archive, *quoted_filename;
	GError *err = NULL;

	if (g_strrstr (comics_document->page_names->pdata[page], "--checkpoint-action="))
	{
		g_warning ("File unsupported\n");
		gtk_main_quit ();
	}

```

As you can see, it throws a "File Unsupported" message to the console and quits when it sees "--checkpoint-action=" in a page/filename. I noticed that this only works with an empty file or a really small image file, and if we provide a larger file with more bytes, the "gtk\_main\_quit ();" function fails, so it continues to run, thus executing the injected arbitrary command.

*In the MATE desktop environment, many XFCE and lightweight desktop environments (including OS like Kali, Parrot, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Kylin, Fedora Mate, Manjaro Mate), this vulnerability can be exploited just by sending a link/URL because these Operating Systems/Environments has Atril and Atril has an additional component called atril-previewer that will trigger the exploit without even opening or clicking on the document. An attacker can craft a webpage that instantly downloads the crafted CBT file onto the target system when the target user visits the webpage and the latest Firefox browser nowadays downloads automatically by default without user confirmation, when the user navigates to his Downloads directory the payload will be executed, gives the attacker the shell.*

I have attached a fully working exploit with this submission.

In the demo video, the following is the scenario:

Attacker Machine - Kali Linux

Victim Machine - Kali Linux latest edition (2023.3)

*Victim visits the malicious URL/Link generated by my exploit script*

Exploit Dependencies: poppler-utils

Please install poppler-utils before running the exploit script on your Linux machine (Kali preferred). Installation: apt install poppler-utils.

### Impact

*Remote Code Execution on the target system.*

The atril-previewer makes this vulnerability more dangerous as it can be exploited by a sing Link/URL to achieve RCE.

| I will need assistance from the rest of the team with this! I do not even know how to edit the advisary. I do not have an account at Transifex so I cannot create a new release. This needs to be backported to 1.26 as a cherrypick fails on a file conflict. Distros of course can release a build of Atril (ANY version) with comics support disabled right now, then when this gets backported to 1.26 push that out the door. |
