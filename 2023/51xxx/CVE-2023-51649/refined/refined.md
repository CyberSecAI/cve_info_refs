Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2023-51649**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of object-level permission enforcement when running Jobs via Job Buttons. The system only checks for the model-level `extras.run_job` permission, not if the user has permission to run a *specific* job.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Object-Level Permission Checks:** When a user attempts to execute a Job through a Job Button, the system does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions for that specific Job. It only verifies if the user has the general `extras.run_job` permission, which allows them to run any job.
*   **Redundant Permission:** The `extras.run_jobbutton` permission, intended to control Job Button usage, is not enforced in the view code. This permission only affects the UI and does not provide any actual security enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A user with permission to run even a single Job can execute any configured Job Button Job. This is a significant privilege escalation vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses of jobs, because not all Jobs can be configured as JobButtons.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the network using the URL `/extras/job-button/<uuid>/run/`.
*   The attacker would need low privileges (a valid user account with at least the permission to run one job).
*   No user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid user account with at least the `extras.run_job` permission.
*   The attacker must be able to access the network where the Nautobot instance is hosted.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `abdikanipd`.
*   The fix is available in Nautobot versions 1.6.8 and 2.1.0.
*   The redundant `extras.run_jobbutton` permission was removed as part of the fix, as it did not provide any real security benefit.
*   The `JobButtonRunView` has been removed as part of the fix as it was deemed redundant. The Job run view now supports a `_return_url` parameter to preserve the existing user experience of redirecting to the previous page.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity with a CVSS score of 3.5
*   The CVSS vector is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L`

The provided information clearly shows that this CVE relates to a missing object-level permission enforcement in Nautobot's Job Button functionality, which can lead to unauthorized job execution.
