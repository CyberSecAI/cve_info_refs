# Closes: [#4988](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988)

# What's Changed

Port of [#4993](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993) to ltm-1.6. A couple of merge conflicts to resolve, and the `job_run` URL is slug-based rather than pk-based in 1.6.

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* n/a Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Example Plugin Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Environment  * Nautobot version (Docker tag too if applicable): 1.6.7 * Python version: 3.8 * Database platform, version: * Middleware(s):  Steps to Reproduce 1 .Create permission for the group and apply a constraint to allow them to run a single job button. 2. 3. Expected Behavior Just group have permission of single job and job-button, nothing else and still user can run all job-buttons. Expected to view and run just allowed job Observed Behavior Still user can run all job-buttons |

| Thanks for the report! Haven't tested it yet but looking at the code it does appear that way. We're only checking `context["user"].has_perms(("extras.run_jobbutton", "extras.run_job"))` when rendering the job\_buttons templatetag, nothing more specific per Job/JobButton instance, and it similarly looks like the view code is only checking for generic `extras.run_job` permission and failing to enforce per-job-button permissions. |

| [@glennmatthews](https://github.com/glennmatthews) It seems to only check if the user has the `context 'user'. has_perms (("extras. run_jobbutton", "extras. run_job"))` Correct. Not for specific jobs, I tried to remove the `extras. run_jobbutton` perms and users can see buttons but cannot run them. It is possible to check `job_pk and job-button_id` for every job context. Constraints can also be based on multiple jobs and job buttons. |

# Missing object-level permissions enforcement when running Job Buttons

Low

[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)
published
GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999
Dec 22, 2023

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=1.5.14

## Patched versions

1.6.8,2.1.0

## Description

### Impact

When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general?). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this *specific* Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case (`/extras/job-button/<uuid>/run/`) The effect is that a user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs.

> Not all Jobs can be configured as JobButtons; only those implemented as subclasses of `JobButtonReceiver` can be used in this way, so this vulnerability only applies specifically to `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses.

Additionally, although the documentation states that both `extras.run_job` permission and `extras.run_jobbutton` permission must be granted to a user in order to run Jobs via JobButton, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is not actually enforced by the view code, only by the UI by disabling the button from being clicked normally. Furthermore, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission never prevented invoking Jobs (including `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses) via the normal "Job Run" UI, so after some discussion, we've decided that the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is redundant, and as it never achieved its stated/documented purpose, the fixes below will remove the UI check for `extras.run_jobbutton` and all other references to the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission, rather than adding enforcement of this previously unenforced permission.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 ([#4995](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995)) and 2.1.0 ([#4993](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993))

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Partial mitigation can be achieved by auditing `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses defined in the system and restricting which users are permitted to create or edit JobButton records.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @glennmatthews **[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)** commented [Dec 15, 2023](#issue-2044440062)

# Closes: [#4988](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988) (will also be needed in 1.6.x)

# What's Changed

* The `job_buttons` template tag wasn't considering object-level permissions when determining whether to enable or disable each JobButton it rendered. I added the appropriate `has_perms` check.
  + There was a lot of duplicate code and logic in this function between the "ungrouped buttons" and "grouped buttons" cases, so I've extracted it into a helper function to reduce duplication.
* Similarly, the `JobButtonRunView` implementation was also not considering object-level permissions. In this case this view is redundant as a JobButton's underlying Job can be invoked just as easily through the `/extras/jobs/<id>/run/` view, which is already enforcing permissions correctly. I've therefore *removed `JobButtonRunView`* rather than attempt to fix it.
  + To keep the existing behavior where clicking a JobButton redirects back to the current page rather than redirecting to the JobResult page, I've added support for a `_return_url` parameter to the Job run view.
* Enforcing `extras.run_jobbutton` permission on top of `extras.run_job` permission was redundant, especially since a user with `extras.run_job` permission alone could still run the underlying job without going through the JobButton. I've therefore *removed `extras.run_jobbutton` as a required permission*; `extras.run_job` suffices.
* In manual testing, I found that the example plugin `ExampleComplexJobButtonReceiver` hadn't been completely/correctly updated to work under 2.0, so I fixed it.

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* n/a Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Example Plugin Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design

Sorry, something went wrong.
