Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from overly permissive API access for end-users of the `sandbox-accounts-for-events` application. Specifically, authenticated users were able to query the events table, gaining access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** End-users were able to directly access and read data from the events table through the API without proper authorization checks.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The API did not have adequate restrictions on which users could access and retrieve event data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could read data from the events table, including:
    *   Planned events details.
    *   Event timeframes.
    *   Event budgets.
    *   Owner email addresses.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could use the leaked information to gain insights into upcoming events and potentially join events they weren't invited to.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not a classic privilege escalation, the vulnerability allowed users to access data they were not intended to see.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious request payloads to the application's events API.
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated users of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have an account on the `sandbox-accounts-for-events` application.
*   **API Access:**  The attacker must be able to make requests to the events API.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of `sandbox-accounts-for-events` prior to 1.1.0.
*   The fix involves blocking the `ListEvents` API call for end users and reducing the number of parameters for end-user API calls, retrieving event management metadata from the backend and auth token only.
*   A workaround is suggested: create events shortly before they are started and delete them directly after they end.
*   The severity is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 7.8.
*   The attack vector is "Local" according to the CVSS v3 metrics, which is a bit misleading, as it refers to a local network in this context rather than a local machine.

**CVSS v3 Base Metrics:**
*   Attack vector: Local
*   Attack complexity: Low
*   Privileges required: Low
*   User interaction: None
*   Scope: Unchanged
*   Confidentiality: High
*   Integrity: High
*   Availability: High
*   CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
