* None

### Bug fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixed an issue with enabling certificate revocation checks.

## Version 2.1.4 (December 05, 2023)[¶](#version-2-1-4-december-05-2023 "Link to this heading")

### New features and updates[¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

* Added support for managing the frequency of retries for unsuccessful connection requests:

  + Added the `RETRY_TIMEOUT` parameter with a default value of 300 seconds.
  + Updated how the driver uses the `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` and `maxHttpRetries` connection parameters and changed the default value of `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` to 300 seconds.

* Implemented asynchronous cleanup while destroying a pool to avoid potential deadlocks.
* Removed confusing error information for PUT commands for GCP.
* Fixed incorrect `SnowflakeDbConnection.Dispose` behavior.

## Version 2.1.2 (September 27, 2023)[¶](#version-2-1-2-september-27-2023 "Link to this heading")

### New features and updates[¶](#id5 "Link to this heading")

* Added support for hybrid transactional and analytical processing:

  + Added retry context in retries for query requests.
  + Added query context caching.
* Added the `GetQueryId()` method to `SnowflakeDbCommand` to retrieve the query ID of the most
  recent executed query to match the existing functionality in `SnowflakeDbDataReader`.

### Bug fixes[¶](#id6 "Link to this heading")

* Fixed an issue where PUT/GET commands could fail with internal stages on Azure government cloud accounts.
* Decreased memory usage in PUT/GET operations.
* Fixed an issue that could occur while uploading and downloading data when source files differed from destination files,
  such as might occur due to automatic file compression.

## Version 2.1.1 (August 22, 2023)[¶](#version-2-1-1-august-22-2023 "Link to this heading")

### New features and updates[¶](#id7 "Link to this heading")

* None.

### Bug fixes[¶](#id8 "Link to this heading")

* Fixed an issue where test connections were not reused when created successfully.
* Fixed an issue where the `*` and `?` wildcards did not work correctly in file paths.
* Fixed an issue where the driver incorrectly required a username and password for external browser authentication.

## Version 2.1.0 (July 27, 2023)[¶](#version-2-1-0-july-27-2023 "Link to this heading")

### BCR (Behavior Change Release) change[¶](#bcr-behavior-change-release-change "Link to this heading")

Fixed an issue where, under certain conditions, the .NET driver could retry HTTP requests indefinitely.
Previously, during an outage the .NET driver would retry the failed HTTP call continuously until the request
succeeds or until someone force kills the operation.

With this change, disables infinite HTTP retries originating from execute and executeQuery calls. Now, the .NET driver
limits HTTP retries to seven, by default. Customers can set the `MAXHTTPRETRIES` connection parameter to
customize the maximum number of retries. Customers can set `MAXHTTPRETRIES=0` to remove the retry limit,
but doing so runs the risk of the .NET driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.

### New features and updates[¶](#id9 "Link to this heading")

* Improved handling of remote paths containing a subdirectory in a GET command.

### Bug fixes[¶](#id10 "Link to this heading")

* Fixed an issue with connection pools that could occur when a dirty connection is closed and the
  `BeginTransaction` method is called explicitly.
* Fixed an issue with `UseProxy` in `HTTPClientHander`.
* Added the `BROWSER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` connection parameter to fix an issue with authentication in an external browser.
  The default is 120 seconds.
* Fixed an issue with connection pool timeouts during daylight saving time transitions.

## Version 2.0.25 (June 16, 2023)[¶](#version-2-0-25-june-16-2023 "Link to this heading")

### New features and updates[¶](#id11 "Link to this heading")

* None

### Bug fixes[¶](#id12 "Link to this heading")

* Fixed an issue where the proxy password could be visible in the Snowflake log file.
* Fixed an issue where `SnowflakeDbDataReader.HasRows()` always returned true for some query types (e.g. SELECT)
  regardless whether there are valid rows in query result.
* Fixed an intermittent “Authentication token has expired” or “Session no longer exists” issue when connection pooling
  enabled.
* Removed use of `WinHttpHandler`.
* Fixed an issue where retries on chunk downloading would occasionally fail, such as when a network error occurred
  after the data was partially downloaded.
* Fixed problem in chunk retry downloading process and improved testing of those retries.

## Version 2.0.24 (May 23, 2023)[¶](#version-2-0-24-may-23-2023 "Link to this heading")

### New features and updates[¶](#id13 "Link to this heading")

  for .NET framework applications.
* Fixed an issue where an error incorrectly occurred when passing an empty USER property in the connection
  string for SSO logins.
* Fixed an issue where database names that contained spaces that were enclosed in double quotes (e.g. “My DB”)
  were not treated properly.

## Version 2.0.22 (March 22, 2023)[¶](#version-2-0-22-march-22-2023 "Link to this heading")

# Snowflake Connector .NET Security Advisory

Moderate

[sfc-gh-fochnik](/sfc-gh-fochnik)
published
GHSA-hwcc-4cv8-cf3h
Dec 22, 2023

## Package

snowflake-connector-net
(.NET)

## Affected versions

>= 2.0.25, <= 2.1.4

## Patched versions

2.1.5

## Description

### Issue

Snowflake recently received a report about a vulnerability in the Snowflake Connector .NET where the checks against the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) were not performed where the insecureMode flag was set to false, which is the default setting. The vulnerability affects versions between 2.0.25 and 2.1.4 (inclusive). Snowflake fixed the issue in [version 2.1.5](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/clients-drivers/dotnet-2023#version-2-1-5-december-18-2023).

### Attack Scenario

Snowflake uses CRL to check if a TLS certificate has been revoked before its expiration date. The lack of correct validation of revoked certificates could, in theory, allow an attacker who has both access to the private key of a correctly issued Snowflake certificate and the ability to intercept network traffic to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack in order to compromise Snowflake credentials used by the driver.

The vulnerability is difficult to exploit given both conditions required and, at the time of this advisory's publication, Snowflake is not aware of any compromise of its certificates, nor unauthorized issuance of such by any publicly trusted Certificate Authority (CA). However, an upgrade to the newest version is recommended to ensure the highest level of security and protection against future unforeseen threats.

### Solution

On December 18, 2023, Snowflake released [version 2.1.5](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/clients-drivers/dotnet-2023#version-2-1-5-december-18-2023) of the Snowflake Connector .NET, which fixes the issue, and we recommend users upgrade to [version 2.1.5](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/clients-drivers/dotnet-2023#version-2-1-5-december-18-2023). Customers continuing to use the impacted versions of the connector should update their insecureMode flag to true.

### Acknowledgement

Snowflake would like to thank [Timo Vink](https://github.com/TimoVink) for reporting this vulnerability.

### Additional Information

If you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).
