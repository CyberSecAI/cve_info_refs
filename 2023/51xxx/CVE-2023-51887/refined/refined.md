Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-51887:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when processing the `\which` directive. Specifically, the application allows the execution of shell commands through `popen` after only minimal checks on the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands via the `\which` directive.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The filtering mechanism fails to prevent the injection of command separators like `;` and utilizes `$IFS` to bypass space filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the mathtex application. This can lead to a full compromise of the system and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web CGI:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable via the web interface (e.g., `mathtex.cgi`) by sending a crafted URL with a `\which` directive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where mathtex is running.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the mathtex CGI script.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `\which` command injection vulnerability.
* **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability is directly accessible without requiring authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `\which` directive uses the `popen` function to execute the `which` command, which is vulnerable to command injection.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `main` function and the `getdirective` function.
*   The filtering attempts to prevent command injection but is easily bypassed.
*   Payload example: `/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?\which{;cd$IFS..;cd$IFS..;cd$IFS..;ls$IFS-al}`
