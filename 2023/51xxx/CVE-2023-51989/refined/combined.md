# DIR-822+ Login Bypass

## Overview

D-Link DIR-822+ V1.0.2 was found login bypass in HNAP1 interface.Allow attackers to log in to administrator accounts with empty passwords

[![image-20231222123220855](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231221212125407.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231221212125407.png)

[![image-20231222123226442](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231221212129179.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231221212129179.png)

## Vulnerability details

This function is the beginning of the entire HNAP authentication

[![image-20231222150820971](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/raw/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231222150820971.png)](https://github.com/funny-mud-peee/IoT-vuls/blob/main/dir822%2B/2/img/image-20231222150820971.png)

This authentication bypass vulnerability is caused by the incorrect use of strncmp() to compare the server-calculated LoginPassword with the LoginPassword presented by the client.

Strncmp (x, y, strlen (y)), where strlen encounters 00 truncation, where y represents the input passwd. If \ x00 is entered, the top 0 bits are compared, and not a single bit is compared. This returns strncmp to 0, so there is an unexpected login success here.
