{
  "CVE-2023-51385": {
    "Description": "In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations.  For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user/hostnames containing shell metacharacters when passed to ssh(1), especially when referenced by expansion tokens in ProxyCommand, LocalCommand, or 'match exec' directives.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user/hostname inputs",
      "Use of expansion tokens (%u, %h) in configuration directives without proper sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Command injection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the client machine. An attacker can execute shell commands through a malicious user or hostname.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting vulnerable configurations of ssh(1) via malicious usernames or hostnames",
       "Malicious git repositories with submodules containing shell metacharacters in user/hostname"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1)",
      "Ability to control or influence the content of a git submodule's user/hostname"
     ],
     "Additional Information": "OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be effective in all situations. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject to these restrictions."
