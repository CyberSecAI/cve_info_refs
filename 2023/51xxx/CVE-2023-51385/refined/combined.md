Changes since OpenSSH 9.5
=========================

This release contains a number of security fixes, some small features
and bugfixes.

Security
========

This release contains fixes for a newly-discovered weakness in the
SSH transport protocol, a logic error relating to constrained PKCS#11
keys in ssh-agent(1) and countermeasures for programs that invoke
ssh(1) with user or hostnames containing invalid characters.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the
   so-called "Terrapin attack" discovered by Fabian Bäumer, Marcus
   Brinkmann and Jörg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a
   limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport
   protocol by sending extra messages prior to the commencement of
   encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages
   immediately after encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server
   would not be able to detect that messages were deleted.

   While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
   is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
   consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
   the protocol prevents user user authentication from proceeding and
   results in a stuck connection.

   The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
   delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
   starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
   timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
   other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.

   OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this protocol weakness through a new "strict
   KEX" protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
   both the client and server support it. This extension makes
   two changes to the SSH transport protocol to improve the integrity
   of the initial key exchange.

   Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the connection if any
   unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange
   (including messages that were previously legal but not strictly
   required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability from
   the early protocol.

   Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the
   conclusion of each key exchange, preventing previously inserted
   messages from being able to make persistent changes to the
   sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of
   these changes should be sufficient to thwart the Terrapin Attack.

   More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the
   OpenSSH source distribition.

 * ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while
   specifying destination constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned
   multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied.
   Use of regular private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys
   are unaffected.

 * ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
   metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a ProxyCommand,
   LocalCommand directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the
   user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token, then
   an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1)
   could potentially perform command injection depending on what
   quoting was present in the user-supplied ssh_config(5) directive.

   This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where
   a repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in
   its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell metacharacters in user
   or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted
   sources.

   Although we believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure
   validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially across a
   security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now
   bans most shell metacharacters from user and hostnames supplied
   via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
   effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to
   universally filter shell metacharacters potentially relevant to
   user-supplied commands.

   User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject to these
   restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to
   continue to be used, under the assumption that the user knows what
   they are doing in their own configuration files.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): the RFC4254 connection/channels protocol provides
   a TCP-like window mechanism that limits the amount of data that
   can be sent without acceptance from the peer. In cases where this
   limit was exceeded by a non-conforming peer SSH implementation,
   ssh(1)/sshd(8) previously discarded the extra data. From OpenSSH
   9.6, ssh(1)/sshd(8) will now terminate the connection if a peer
   exceeds the window limit by more than a small grace factor. This
   change should have no effect of SSH implementations that follow
   the specification.

New features
------------

 * ssh(1): add a %j token that expands to the configured ProxyJump
   hostname (or the empty string if this option is not being used)
   that can be used in a number of ssh_config(5) keywords. bz3610

 * ssh(1): add ChannelTimeout support to the client, mirroring the
   same option in the server and allowing ssh(1) to terminate
   quiescent channels.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): add support for
   reading ED25519 private keys in PEM PKCS8 format. Previously
   only the OpenSSH private key format was supported.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): introduce a protocol extension to allow
   renegotiation of acceptable signature algorithms for public key
   authentication after the server has learned the username being
   used for authentication. This allows varying sshd_config(5)
   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms in a "Match user" block.

 * ssh-add(1), ssh-agent(1): add an agent protocol extension to allow
   specifying certificates when loading PKCS#11 keys. This allows the
   use of certificates backed by PKCS#11 private keys in all OpenSSH
   tools that support ssh-agent(1). Previously only ssh(1) supported
   this use-case.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): when deciding whether to enable the keystroke timing
   obfuscation, enable it only if a channel with a TTY is active.

 * ssh(1): switch mainloop from poll(3) to ppoll(3) and mask signals
   before checking flags set in signal handler. Avoids potential
   race condition between signaling ssh to exit and polling. bz3531

 * ssh(1): when connecting to a destination with both the
   AddressFamily and CanonicalizeHostname directives in use,
   the AddressFamily directive could be ignored. bz5326

 * sftp(1): correct handling of the limits@...nssh.com option when
   the server returned an unexpected message.

 * A number of fixes to the PuTTY and Dropbear regress/integration
   tests.

 * ssh(1): release GSS OIDs only at end of authentication, avoiding
   unnecessary init/cleanup cycles. bz2982

 * ssh_config(5): mention "none" is a valid argument to IdentityFile
   in the manual. bz3080

 * scp(1): improved debugging for paths from the server rejected for
   not matching the client's glob(3) pattern in old SCP/RCP protocol
   mode.

 * ssh-agent(1): refuse signing operations on destination-constrained
   keys if a previous session-bind operation has failed. This may
   prevent a fail-open situation in future if a user uses a mismatched
   ssh(1) client and ssh-agent(1) where the client supports a key type
   that the agent does not support.

Portability
-----------

 * Better identify unsupported and unstable compiler flags, such as
   -fzero-call-used-regs which has been unstable across a several
   clang releases.

 * A number of fixes to regression test reliability and log
   collection.

 * Update the OpenSSL dependency in the RPM specification.

 * sshd(8): for OpenSolaris systems that support privilege limitation
   via the getpflags() interface, prefer using the newer PRIV_XPOLICY
   to PRIV_LIMIT. bz2833

Package        : openssh
Version        : 1:7.9p1-10+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-41617 CVE-2023-48795 CVE-2023-51385
Debian Bug     : 995130

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of
the SSH protocol suite.

CVE-2021-41617

    It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise supplemental
    groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command
    as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit the groups that
    sshd was started with.

CVE-2023-48795

    Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that the SSH
    protocol is prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as the "Terrapin
    attack". This attack allows a MITM attacker to effect a limited break of the
    integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra
    messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal
    number of consecutive messages immediately after encryption starts.

    Details can be found at <https://terrapin-attack.com/>

CVE-2023-51385

    It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
    metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
    directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the user or hostname via
    expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
    user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command injection. The
    situation could arise in case of git repositories with submodules, where the
    repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user or
    hostname.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:7.9p1-10+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

# SSH ProxyCommand == unexpected code execution (CVE-2023-51385)

Dec 20, 2023

## Summary

SSH’s `ProxyCommand` is a feature quite widely used to proxy ssh connections by allowing to specify custom commands to be used to connect to the server. Arguments to this directive may contain tokens like `%h`, `%u` which refer to hostname and username respectively.

When coming from untrusted sources, a hostname can be malicious and look something like **`malicious-command`** (backticks would allow a command to be executed in shell)

[More info in docs which describe this feature in detail](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#ProxyCommand)

## Let’s review an example

Taking an example based on the [docs](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#ProxyCommand)

```
Host *.example.com
  ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p

```

In this case, there is no sanitization of hostname and if `%h` contains a malicious hostname, it may allow command execution.

## Can I haz PoC?

What good is all this without a PoC? So here we go! Once you have added the above example to your `.ssh/config`, try following which should pop a calculator on OS X.

```
git clone https://github.com/vin01/poc-proxycommand-vulnerable --recurse-submodules

```

Even if the ProxyCommand is being used with single quotes to sanitize arguments i.e. '%h', it is not sufficient since an attacker controlled hostname might itself contain a single quote and defeat quoting.

PoC 2:

```
git clone https://github.com/vin01/poc-proxycommand-vulnerable-v2 --recurse-submodules

```
## Remediation

Update to:

* [OpenSSH 9.6p1](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.6)

Changes since OpenSSH 9.5
=========================
This release contains a number of security fixes, some small features
and bugfixes.
Security
========
This release contains fixes for a newly-discovered weakness in the
SSH transport protocol, a logic error relating to constrained PKCS#11
keys in ssh-agent(1) and countermeasures for programs that invoke
ssh(1) with user or hostnames containing invalid characters.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the
so-called "Terrapin attack" discovered by Fabian BÃ¤umer, Marcus
Brinkmann and JÃ¶rg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a
limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport
protocol by sending extra messages prior to the commencement of

immediately after encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server
would not be able to detect that messages were deleted.
While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
the protocol prevents user user authentication from proceeding and
results in a stuck connection.
The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
delete the SSH2\_MSG\_EXT\_INFO message sent before authentication
starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.
OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this protocol weakness through a new "strict
KEX" protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
both the client and server support it. This extension makes
two changes to the SSH transport protocol to improve the integrity
of the initial key exchange.
Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the connection if any
unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange

Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the
conclusion of each key exchange, preventing previously inserted
messages from being able to make persistent changes to the
sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of
these changes should be sufficient to thwart the Terrapin Attack.
More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the
OpenSSH source distribition.
\* ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while
specifying destination constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned
multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied.
Use of regular private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys
are unaffected.
\* ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a ProxyCommand,
LocalCommand directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the
user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token, then
an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1)

This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where
a repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in

limit was exceeded by a non-conforming peer SSH implementation,
ssh(1)/sshd(8) previously discarded the extra data. From OpenSSH
9.6, ssh(1)/sshd(8) will now terminate the connection if a peer
exceeds the window limit by more than a small grace factor. This
change should have no effect of SSH implementations that follow
the specification.

Subject: CVE-2023-51385, CVE-2023-6004: OpenSSH, libssh: Security weakness in ProxyCommand handling

Hi,

This was previously announced as mitigated in OpenSSH 9.6:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/18/2>

and is now known as CVE-2023-51385 described as follows:

> In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user
> name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced
> by an expansion token in certain situations.  For example, an untrusted
> Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user
> name or host name.

The corresponding libssh issue got assigned CVE-2023-6004, with their
advisory here:

<https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6004.txt>

and quoted below:

Incidentally, NIST NVD's current CVSS 3.1 score for OpenSSH's
CVE-2023-51385 is a ridiculous 9.8.  Quite usual for CVSS and NVD.

There's a blog post on exploitation via git submodules and on
"Vulnerable usage out in the wild" here:

Package        : openssh
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-41617 CVE-2023-28531 CVE-2023-48795 CVE-2023-51384
                 CVE-2023-51385
Debian Bug     : 995130 1033166

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an
implementation of the SSH protocol suite.

CVE-2021-41617

    It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise
    supplemental groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the
    command as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit
    the groups that sshd was started with.

CVE-2023-28531

    Luci Stanescu reported that a error prevented constraints being
    communicated to the ssh-agent when adding smartcard keys to the
    agent with per-hop destination constraints, resulting in keys being
    added without constraints.

CVE-2023-48795

    Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that
    the SSH protocol is prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as
    the "Terrapin attack". This attack allows a MITM attacker to effect
    a limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH
    transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of
    consecutive messages immediately after encryption starts.

    Details can be found at <https://terrapin-attack.com/>

CVE-2023-51384

    It was discovered that when PKCS#11-hosted private keys were
    added while specifying destination constraints, if the PKCS#11
    token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the
    constraints applied.

CVE-2023-51385

    It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained
    shell metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand,
    LocalCommand directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the user
    or hostname via expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply
    arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command
    injection. The situation could arise in case of git repositories
    with submodules, where the repository could contain a submodule with
    shell characters in its user or hostname.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:8.4p1-5+deb11u3.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.2p1-2+deb12u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssh>

upstream: ban user/hostnames with most shell metacharacters

```
This makes ssh(1) refuse user or host names provided on the
commandline that contain most shell metacharacters.

Some programs that invoke ssh(1) using untrusted data do not filter
metacharacters in arguments they supply. This could create
interactions with user-specified ProxyCommand and other directives
that allow shell injection attacks to occur.

It's a mistake to invoke ssh(1) with arbitrary untrusted arguments,
but getting this stuff right can be tricky, so this should prevent
most obvious ways of creating risky situations. It however is not
and cannot be perfect: ssh(1) has no practical way of interpreting
what shell quoting rules are in use and how they interact with the
user's specified ProxyCommand.

To allow configurations that use strange user or hostnames to
continue to work, this strictness is applied only to names coming
from the commandline. Names specified using User or Hostname
directives in ssh_config(5) are not affected.
