- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Job Manager & Career plugin, versions 1.4.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies based on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection, targeting a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice an authenticated user to unknowingly trigger the crafted request. The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges to initiate the attack, but requires the victim to be logged in and have the required privileges to execute the unwanted actions.
