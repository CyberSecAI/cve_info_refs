The provided content is related to CVE-2023-51459.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Stored XSS vulnerability, which means that the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low level of attack complexity (AC:L) and a low privileged user (PR:L). The user interaction is required (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C). The confidentiality, integrity and availability impacts are low (C:L/I:L/A:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user, and needs to trick another user to interact with the malicious code, as it's a stored XSS.
