The provided content describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in CrateDB.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way CrateDB's Host-Based Authentication (HBA) handles the `X-Real-IP` header. When the `auth.host_based.config.0.address` is set to `*local*`, the system allows access from `127.0.0.1` or `::1`. By setting the `X-Real-IP` header to either `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, an attacker can bypass authentication and access the Admin UI as the default 'crate' user, even when password authentication is enabled for other users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `X-Real-IP` header.
- Incorrect assumption that traffic with `X-Real-IP` set to `127.0.0.1` or `::1` is always local and trusted.
- Lack of proper authentication checks in the Admin UI component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the CrateDB Admin UI with superuser privileges (default `crate` user).
- Potential for complete compromise of the database including data exfiltration, modification and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an HTTP request with a crafted `X-Real-IP` header to the CrateDB server.
- This can be done by sending a request to the Admin UI directly or by sending SQL queries through the HTTP API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the CrateDB server.
- No prior credentials are required as the exploit bypasses authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affects CrateDB version 5.5.1 and possibly other versions.
- The vulnerability affects both local deployments and cloud instances.
- The provided example demonstrates the exploit using curl with a SQL query, but this bypass can also be used with the Admin UI.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when password authentication is configured.
