{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient input sanitization in the `form_actions` function within the `managers.php` file, specifically when handling the `selected_graphs_array` parameter. This parameter's value is deserialized using `cacti_unserialize` after being processed by `stripslashes`, which removes backslashes but doesn't sanitize against SQL injection. Subsequently, the deserialized data is used to construct raw SQL queries without proper validation, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability",
    "Insufficient input sanitization",
    "Use of `stripslashes` without additional sanitization",
    "Direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries",
    "Improper handling of deserialized data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose Cacti database contents using a time-based blind SQLi technique. Depending on database configuration, the attacker may achieve further impacts such as arbitrary file read or potentially remote code execution via arbitrary file write.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cacti/managers.php` endpoint. The `selected_graphs_array` parameter within the HTTP request contains a serialized PHP array with an SQLi payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with the “Settings/Utilities” permission. They also need to know that at least one entry exists within the affected database tables for the injection to trigger."
