- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute certain actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper access control checks in a specific function of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with at least "Contributor" privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
