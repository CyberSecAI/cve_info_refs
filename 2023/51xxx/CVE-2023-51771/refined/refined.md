The provided content relates to CVE-2023-51771.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one global buffer overflow exists in the `_ParseHeader` function within `lib/server.c` of the MicroHttpServer C version. Specifically, the vulnerability is located at line 208 in the `recv` function call within a loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one error leading to a global buffer overflow.
- The `recv` function within the loop reads data from the network socket without properly checking the boundary, potentially writing one byte beyond the allocated buffer when handling a large URI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE), depending on the implementation and the overwritten memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor can send a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long URI to trigger the overflow when parsing the header.
- The vulnerable code is in `lib/server.c` which handles the HTTP requests received by the server application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server, meaning they need network access to the machine running the server application.
- They do not need any prior authentication to send the malicious request.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs at roughly 15330 bytes in the request URI.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) in the GitHub issue shows the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a "GET" request with 20000 "?" characters in the URI.
- AddressSanitizer output confirms a global-buffer-overflow when exploiting the vulnerability.
- A suggested fix is provided to modify the loop condition to read up to one less byte into the buffer before processing.
- The issue was fixed in commit `f7285de` with an added URI and HTTP version length boundary check to avoid the buffer overflow.
