      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by uncontrolled recursion in the `Criteria.parse()` method due to an issue in the `PathCompiler.readBracketPropertyToken` method, which does not correctly handle missing closing square brackets in a JSON path expression. Specifically, the `indexOfNextSignificantChar` method could return -1 if a closing bracket isn't found, causing an infinite recursion.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Stack overflow vulnerability due to uncontrolled recursion.",
          "Improper handling of missing closing brackets in JSON path expressions."
        ],
        "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a stack overflow, which can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application's thread. While some discussions argue the impact is low since only the thread processing the malicious input crashes and not the whole application, this might still lead to availability issues if not properly handled.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through processing specially crafted, malicious JSON path expressions via the `Criteria.parse()` method.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious JSON path expressions to the vulnerable `Criteria.parse()` method. No special privileges or user interaction is required. This can be achieved remotely if an application exposes an API that processes user-provided JSON paths.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects versions >= 2.2.0 and < 2.9.0. The fix was implemented in version 2.9.0 by correctly handling cases where a closing bracket is missing. The issue was identified in the `Criteria.parse` method but also affects `JsonPath.read` and `JsonPath.compile` methods when they process malicious JSON paths as an input. It's also noted that the deprecated `Criteria.parse` and `Criteria.where` methods are affected. The CVSS score was debated, with some arguing that the Availability impact should be low or none due to thread-based crash instead of complete application crash."
