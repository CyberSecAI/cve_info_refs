Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51749:

**CVE Description:**

The official CVE description is "ScaleFusion 10.5.2 does not properly limit users to the Edge application because a search can be made from a tooltip."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that even when Scalefusion is configured to restrict the system to only running MS Edge in browser mode, the tooltip search functionality within the browser allows users to bypass the intended restrictions. This is because highlighting a word in the browser triggers a tooltip that allows searching that word via MS Edge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Kiosk Mode Restrictions:** The Scalefusion agent fails to completely restrict user interaction within the configured browser mode.
*   **Unrestricted Tooltip Search:** The ability to search from tooltips within MS Edge provides a means to navigate away from the intended application.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization/Validation:** The system does not properly restrict navigation or actions initiated from the tooltip search results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability:** Attackers can access sensitive information, execute arbitrary code, conduct phishing attacks, or erase important files.
*   **Kiosk Mode Bypass:** The primary purpose of the kiosk mode is defeated, leading to unrestricted system access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Tooltip Search:** The attacker highlights a word within the browser, which prompts a tooltip.
*   **Bing Search:** The attacker uses the tooltip search to open a new tab with a bing search.
*   **Navigation:** The attacker uses the search results or direct URL to navigate to unintended sites or download files.
*   **Unrestricted System Access:** By navigating to sites with file downloads, the file explorer is triggered. This allows users to access the file system and execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical System Access:** The attacker needs physical or remote access to the system where the Scalefusion kiosk is running.
*   **No Elevated Privileges Needed:** No admin privileges are required as the kiosk is configured with auto-login.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content elaborates on multiple methods to bypass the kiosk mode, including using file picker dialogs, manipulating browser behavior, and using taskbar context menus. In particular regarding this CVE, method 2 from the medium.com_5ebd73ae_20250114_191709.html content provides the exploit flow:
1. Via mouse/touch screen highlight any word, which brings tool tip to search that word via MS Edge. Click on that to open adjacent tab with new bing search
2. Search via keywords or direct URL which is to be opened and select from the results.
3. OR Click on Open link in new tab to view it in full screen
