- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application lacks proper access controls and allows directory listing for the `/fm` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Site-wide directory listing vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can list the files hosted by the web application. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially further exploitation if sensitive files are exposed.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the `/fm` endpoint via HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web application over the network. No authentication is required.
