The provided content describes a vulnerability in D-Link DIR-815 router firmware, specifically version `dir815_v1.01SSb08.bin`. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `soapcgi_main` function of the `cgibin` binary. The `service` GET parameter in HTTP POST requests to `/soap.cgi` on port 49152 is not properly sanitized, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization in the `service` GET parameter
- Vulnerable `soapcgi_main` function in the `cgibin` binary

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the device
- Complete compromise of the affected D-Link DIR-815 router
- Ability to execute arbitrary shell commands

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/soap.cgi` on port 49152
- Utilizing the `service` GET parameter to inject malicious shell commands

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable D-Link router
- No authentication is required for exploitation

**Technical Details:**

The exploit utilizes the following structure:

1.  **Network Connection:** Establishes a connection to the target router on port 49152 using `nc`.
2.  **HTTP POST Request:** Sends an HTTP POST request to `/soap.cgi`
3.  **`service` parameter injection:** The `service` parameter in the URL is used to inject commands like `iptables` configuration changes and starting telnet on port 9999:
    ```
    /soap.cgi?service=|iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT|iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT|iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT|iptables -t nat -P PREROUTING ACCEPT|iptables -t nat -P OUTPUT ACCEPT|iptables -t nat -P POSTROUTING ACCEPT|telnetd -p 9999|
    ```
4.  **Content-Length and SOAPAction headers:** These are set as required by the targeted endpoint.
5.  **Command Execution:** After the POST request is sent, the injected commands execute, enabling the attacker to telnet into the device.
6.  **Telnet connection:** Telnet is established to port 9999 (`telnet 192.168.0.1 9999`).

This exploit can lead to full compromise of the router, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary actions.
