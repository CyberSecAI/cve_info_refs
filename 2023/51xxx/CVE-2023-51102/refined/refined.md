The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in the Tenda W9 router, specifically within the `formWifiMacFilterSet` function of the `httpd` binary.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow occurs in the `formWifiMacFilterSet` function, which handles the request on the `/goform/WifiMacFilterSet` URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the router, potentially leading to full control of the device.
- In this example, the exploit executes a telnet daemon for remote access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/WifiMacFilterSet`.
- The payload is embedded in the `ssidIndex` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the router's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability and the required payload structure.
- The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface, requiring a valid cookie value `w9v1_user=admin;`.

The provided content includes a Python script demonstrating the exploit, as well as screenshots showing the exploit in action. It gives significantly more detail than the basic CVE description, by outlining the vulnerable function, the method of exploitation, and providing a working exploit script.
