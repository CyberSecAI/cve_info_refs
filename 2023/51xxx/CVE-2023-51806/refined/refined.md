Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-51806 (based on the issue title, though the description is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded PDF files, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts within the PDF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**: The system fails to neutralize or sanitize user-supplied input (the malicious script embedded in the PDF) before rendering it in a web page, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the PDF file. When a user views this manipulated PDF within the web application, the script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious activities within the user's browser context

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload**: The attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Viewing the PDF**: When a user views the uploaded (malicious) PDF via the application's interface, the embedded script is executed within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to upload files**: The attacker needs the capability to upload files to the system.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability**: The attacker needs to know that the system does not properly sanitize PDF files.

**Additional Details (from the GitHub issue):**
*   The vulnerability affects **Ujcms v8.0.2**.
*   The vulnerability was discovered when the application was deployed on Tomcat.
*   The issue provides a proof of concept (POC) with images showing the upload of the malicious PDF and its subsequent execution within the browser (Edge).
*   The suggested fix is to filter uploaded PDF files to ensure they do not contain malicious scripts or other harmful content.

**Summary:**

The content describes a vulnerability where a crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript can be uploaded to the Ujcms application. When viewed through the application, the JavaScript executes in the user's browser, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The root cause is a lack of input sanitization on uploaded PDF files, specifically failure to remove or neutralize the embedded JavaScript.
