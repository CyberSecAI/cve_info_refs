- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly validate whether a log file is a normal file or a symbolic link before accessing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper link resolution/symlink vulnerability (CWE-59).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can perform a symlink attack, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected PC.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access (the attacker needs to have local access to the machine).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to create a symbolic link.
