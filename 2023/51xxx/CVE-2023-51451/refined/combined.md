# SSRF in symbolicator via invalid protocol

Moderate

[oioki](/oioki)
published
GHSA-ghg9-7m82-h96r
Dec 21, 2023

## Package

cargo

symbolicator
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>=0.3.3,<23.12.1

## Patched versions

23.12.1

## Description

### Impact

Symbolicator is a service used in Sentry. An attacker could make Symbolicator send GET HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs with internal IP addresses by using an invalid protocol. The responses of those requests could be exposed via Symbolicator's API. In affected Sentry instances, the data could be exposed through the Sentry API and user interface if the attacker has a registered account.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Symbolicator release [23.12.1](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/releases/tag/23.12.1), Sentry self-hosted release [23.12.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.12.1), and has already been mitigated on sentry.io on December 18.

### Workaround

Please update Symbolicator and [Sentry self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted). If updating is not possible, the following can be done to mitigate the issue:

1. Disable JS processing by toggling the option "Allow JavaScript Source Fetching" in *Organization Settings > Security & Privacy*.
2. Disable all untrusted public repositories under *Project Settings > Debug Files*.

Alternatively, if JavaScript and native symbolication are not required, disable Symbolicator completely in `config.yml` by specifying:

```
symbolicator.enabled: false
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
