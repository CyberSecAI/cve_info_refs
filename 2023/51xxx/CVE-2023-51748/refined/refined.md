The provided content relates to CVE-2023-51748.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Scalefusion Windows MDM Agent's failure to properly restrict access to system functionalities when in Kiosk mode. Specifically, the use of `Ctrl+S` or `Ctrl+O` keyboard shortcuts allows access to the Windows file picker dialog, enabling users to bypass the intended restrictions of the kiosk mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input sanitization
- Insufficient restrictions on system features in Kiosk mode.
- Default file explorer access

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full system access can be achieved.
- Unauthorized access to the filesystem.
- Ability to execute commands via the address bar.
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Potential data theft or manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+O`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical system access.
- No special user privileges are needed, as the kiosk mode typically uses an auto-login user.
