Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection when fetching podcast RSS feeds. Specifically, the `podcastUtils.js` file within Audiobookshelf v2.6.0 does not adequately validate or sanitize the provided `rssFeed` URL, allowing an attacker to potentially make requests to internal resources or arbitrary external URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application makes a request to a URL provided by the user without proper validation, making the server make an unintended request on behalf of the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially probe internal network resources or services, exposing sensitive information.
- **Resource Consumption:** Malicious requests could cause a denial of service by overwhelming internal resources.
- **Potential Further Exploitation:** Exploiting the SSRF vulnerability can potentially be a stepping stone for other attacks like accessing internal services, databases etc

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `POST /api/podcasts/feed` endpoint. An attacker can make a request to this endpoint with a malicious `rssFeed` URL in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/api/podcasts/feed` endpoint, which requires authentication with `isAdminOrUp` privileges.
- The attacker also needs knowledge of the API and the structure of the request body.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `podcastUtils.js` specifically the `getPodcastFeed` function.
- The fix involves adding the `ssrfFilter` to the axios request options to prevent internal URLs
- The vulnerable code uses `axios.get`  to fetch the RSS feed. The fix applies `ssrfFilter` to the request.
- The vulnerability has been assigned the identifier `GHSL-2023-267`.
- The patched version is 2.7.0

**Summary of changes:**
- The commit `f2f2ea161ca0701e1405e737b0df0f96296e4f64` introduced the fix for this vulnerability, which includes:
  - Validating the URL using `validateUrl` function which uses the `URL` class to validate the string.
  - Implementing an SSRF filter using the `ssrf-req-filter` library. The `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent` options of `axios` are set with the return value of this filter.
  - Added the `validateUrl` function to `server/utils/index.js` which uses the `URL` class to validate the url string and returns `null` if it fails validation.
  - Updated `PodcastController.js` to use the `validateUrl` function on the provided `rssFeed`.
