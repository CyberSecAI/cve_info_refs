- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Assetwise Integrity Information Server has an issue that allows an unauthenticated user to craft malicious requests to view configuration options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to lack of proper authentication and authorization controls on configuration settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read sensitive configuration information from the server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a maliciously crafted request to the server over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated, and must be able to send network requests to the affected server.
