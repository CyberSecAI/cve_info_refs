Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2023-51764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SMTP Smuggling:** The root cause lies in inconsistent interpretations of the SMTP protocol's end-of-data sequence (`<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`). Some SMTP servers incorrectly process variations of this sequence, such as `<LF>.<LF>`, `<LF>.<CR><LF>` or `<CR>.<CR>`, as the end-of-data marker. This allows an attacker to embed further SMTP commands within the message body, which will be interpreted as a separate email on a downstream, vulnerable mail server.
*   **Improper Line Ending Handling:** The vulnerability stems from SMTP servers not strictly adhering to RFC 5321 which requires `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>` to terminate email data. Some implementations treat other sequences (like `<LF>.<LF>`) as valid end-of-data markers, leading to the smuggling.
*   **Outbound and Inbound Server Discrepancies:** SMTP smuggling occurs when an outbound server does not filter the "fake" end of data sequences while the receiving, inbound server interprets them. This difference in handling of line endings/end-of-data markers enables the injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SMTP Pipelining:** Many SMTP servers allow "pipelining", where multiple commands are sent without waiting for responses, thus amplifying the impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Strict RFC Compliance:**  Servers that do not strictly adhere to RFC 5321 by allowing line feeds alone or other variations of the end-of-data sequence become vulnerable as receivers.
*   **Inconsistent Implementations:** Variations in SMTP server implementations with regard to end-of-data sequences provide the entry point for the attack.
*   **Vulnerable Default Configurations**: Some mail servers, notably Cisco Secure Email Gateway, use insecure default settings that make them susceptible to this attack out of the box.
*   **Misinterpretation of EOD:** Email servers that process variations of the EOD sequence due to lax parsing are also vulnerable.
*   **Lack of Sanitization of Input**: The vulnerability is also caused by outbound servers not sanitizing or filtering these variations before transmitting the message to downstream systems.
*   **Unprotected Pipelining:** Some mail servers did not restrict or validate pipelined SMTP commands thus enabling the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Spoofing:** Attackers can spoof email addresses, sending messages that appear to originate from legitimate domains.
*   **SPF/DKIM/DMARC Bypass:** By using legitimate outbound servers, attackers can bypass SPF, DKIM and DMARC email authentication checks.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can craft convincing phishing emails with spoofed sender addresses, increasing the likelihood of users falling victim to such attacks.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can potentially distribute malware by sending spoofed emails with malicious attachments or links.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Email spoofing can damage the reputation of organizations that have their domains or servers exploited.
*   **Cross-domain Spoofing:**  Attackers may exploit combinations of different mail servers (e.g. sending mail through GMX that spoofs other domains on Ionos).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SMTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted SMTP messages that include variations of the end-of-data sequence in the message body.
*   **Direct SMTP Connection:** The attacker establishes a direct SMTP connection to the vulnerable outbound server (e.g. a mail server hosted by outlook.com or gmx.net).
*   **Message Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SMTP commands and spoofed email content within what appears to be normal email data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with vulnerable SMTP servers.
*   **Outbound Server Access:**  An account on a vulnerable outbound mail server that does not filter the variations of the end of data sequences is required.
*   **SMTP Knowledge:** Understanding of the SMTP protocol is necessary to craft malicious messages.
*   **Target Inbound Server:** Access or an understanding of the target inbound mail server to determine its interpretation of the EOD sequence (e.g., by a service scan or a test).
*   **Ability to send through a trusted mail server**: For the attack to bypass sender authentication checks (SPF/DKIM), the initial, legit email needs to pass these checks.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Red Hat Advisory:** Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2024:9243 addresses this issue, which has been identified as CVE-2023-51764.
*   **Postfix Fixes:**  Postfix version 3.8.4 and later include fixes, which involve a new configuration option called `smtpd_forbid_bare_newline` to control how bare linefeeds are handled during email data transfer. Earlier Postfix versions also have patches available with the `smtpd_forbid_unauth_pipelining` option available as a quick workaround.  The setting "smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = normalize" is the default for Postfix releases 3.9 and later.
*   **Sendmail and Exim Fixes:** Sendmail (8.18.0.2) and Exim (4.97.1) also provide fixes and workarounds.
*   **Cisco:** Cisco Secure Email Gateway is vulnerable due to the default "clean" setting and their response is to consider it a feature.
*   **Mitigations:** Short term mitigation can be done with `smtpd_forbid_unauth_pipelining = yes` for Postfix versions before 3.9. Longer term fixes include using the `smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = normalize` setting in more recent versions.

The provided content goes into great detail about the discovery process, the impact, and the various responses (or lack thereof) from different vendors. The core problem revolves around the SMTP servers not enforcing the correct EOD sequence, thereby enabling SMTP smuggling.
