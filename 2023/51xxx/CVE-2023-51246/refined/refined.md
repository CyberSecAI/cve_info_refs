- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization when using the source code mode in the admin panel to add articles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** When an attacker injects a malicious XSS payload via the source code editor, it will be stored and executed when other users (peers and readers) access the compromised article, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via the admin panel `/admin/edit.php` using the source code mode when adding or editing articles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have backend user access privileges in the CMS to use the source code editor within the article editing interface.
