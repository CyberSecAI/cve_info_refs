- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Rise Blocks Plugin (versions <= 3.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request sent by an attacker, which leverages the existing authentication of a logged-in user to execute actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into initiating that request. This does not require the attacker to be authenticated.
