journalpump is a daemon that takes log messages from journald and pumps them to a given output. A logging vulnerability was found in journalpump which logs out the configuration of a service integration in plaintext to the supplied logging pipeline, including credential information contained in the configuration if any. The problem has been patched in journalpump 2.5.0.
