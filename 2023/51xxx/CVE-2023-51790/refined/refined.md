The provided content details a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Piwigo version 14.0.0, specifically within the "ato_lang" parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure injection of the "ato_lang" parameter value from the URL directly into the HTML page without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious HTML and JavaScript code can be injected via the `ato_lang` parameter.
- Session-level persistence: The injected malicious payload persists across different pages as long as the administrator's session is active because the `lang` parameter is present on every page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the HTML page.
- This script can be executed by webmasters or administrators when they visit a specially crafted URL, leading to actions like session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the website
- The persistent nature means that the payload remains active during an administrator's browsing session, exposing them to ongoing risks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes a malicious payload within the `ato_lang` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick a webmaster or administrator into visiting it.
- The targeted user must be logged in to be vulnerable, as the payload persists through their session.
