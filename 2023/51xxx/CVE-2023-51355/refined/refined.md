- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
