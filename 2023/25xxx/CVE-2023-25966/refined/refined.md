- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically the lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is described as having a low severity and unlikely to be exploited, but generally, this type of vulnerability could allow unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access controls within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be an unprivileged user, suggesting they need to be a user of the WordPress website with limited permissions.
