Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `_alertFromGet` function within `view/js/script.js`. This function retrieves parameters from the URL using `urlParams.get(type)`. The retrieved value (intended for display as a message) is not properly sanitized before being inserted into the DOM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The code takes a parameter from the URL (specifically the `success` parameter), and directly inserts it into the HTML without sufficient sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The original code used `div.innerHTML = msg;` which directly inserts the unsanitized value into the DOM. Although the code includes a `cleanHTML` function, it's executed after the initial injection, which means that the attacker could still inject and execute malicious Javascript.
*   **Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered via URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** As stated in the commit message, a successful XSS attack could be used to potentially take over an administrator's account. This is achieved by injecting malicious JavaScript that could steal cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in the `success` parameter. For example:
    `https://demo.avideo.com/user?success="><img> src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and get a user of the vulnerable application to open it.
*   No special access is required as the vulnerable parameter is exposed to anyone who has access to the web application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The commit shows that the vulnerable code was `div.innerHTML = msg;`, this line was changed to `div.innerHTML = cleanHTML(msg, false);` to sanitize the HTML.
*   The provided example demonstrates how the XSS can be triggered using the `success` URL parameter.

**In Summary:**

The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the AVideo platform, where unsanitized URL parameters are directly injected into the HTML of the page, allowing an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript. The vulnerability has been patched by adding a sanitization function.
