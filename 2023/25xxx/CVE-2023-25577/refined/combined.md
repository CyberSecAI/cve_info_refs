# high resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields

High

[davidism](/davidism)
published
GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

pip

Werkzeug
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=2.2.2

## Patched versions

2.2.3

## Description

Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage.

This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : python-werkzeug
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-23934 CVE-2023-25577
Debian Bug     : 1031370

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in python-werkzeug, a collection
of utilities for WSGI applications.

CVE-2023-23934

    It was discovered that Werkzeug did not properly handle the parsing
    of nameless cookies which may allow shadowing of other cookies.

CVE-2023-25577

    It was discovered that Werkzeug could parse unlimited number of
    parts, including file parts, which may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1+dfsg1-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-werkzeug packages.

For the detailed security status of python-werkzeug please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-werkzeug>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

|  |  | Limiting Request Data |
|  |  | --------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To avoid being the victim of a DDOS attack you can set the maximum |
|  |  | accepted content length and request field sizes. The :class:`Request` |
|  |  | class has two attributes for that: :attr:`~Request.max\_content\_length` |
|  |  | and :attr:`~Request.max\_form\_memory\_size`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The first one can be used to limit the total content length. For example |
|  |  | by setting it to ``1024 \* 1024 \* 16`` the request won't accept more than |
|  |  | 16MB of transmitted data. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because certain data can't be moved to the hard disk (regular post data) |
|  |  | whereas temporary files can, there is a second limit you can set. The |
|  |  | :attr:`~Request.max\_form\_memory\_size` limits the size of `POST` |
|  |  | transmitted form data. By setting it to ``1024 \* 1024 \* 2`` you can make |
|  |  | sure that all in memory-stored fields are not more than 2MB in size. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This however does \*not\* affect in-memory stored files if the |
|  |  | `stream\_factory` used returns a in-memory file. |
|  |  | The :class:`Request` class provides a few attributes to control how much data is |
|  |  | processed from the request body. This can help mitigate DoS attacks that craft the |
|  |  | request in such a way that the server uses too many resources to handle it. Each of |
|  |  | these limits will raise a :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.RequestEntityTooLarge` if they are |
|  |  | exceeded. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - :attr:`~Request.max\_content\_length` Stop reading request data after this number |
|  |  | of bytes. It's better to configure this in the WSGI server or HTTP server, rather |
|  |  | than the WSGI application. |
|  |  | - :attr:`~Request.max\_form\_memory\_size` Stop reading request data if any form part is |
|  |  | larger than this number of bytes. While file parts can be moved to disk, regular |
|  |  | form field data is stored in memory only. |
|  |  | - :attr:`~Request.max\_form\_parts` Stop reading request data if more than this number |
|  |  | of parts are sent in multipart form data. This is useful to stop a very large number |
|  |  | of very small parts, especially file parts. The default is 1000. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Using Werkzeug to set these limits is only one layer of protection. WSGI servers |
|  |  | and HTTPS servers should set their own limits on size and timeouts. The operating system |
|  |  | or container manager should set limits on memory and processing time for server |
|  |  | processes. |
