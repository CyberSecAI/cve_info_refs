Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Stimulsoft Reporting Designer (Web) allows users to specify a local file path as a data source instead of using the file selection dialog. This bypass allows the software to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The software does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing attackers to read files from the server's file system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not enforce the usage of the intended file selection dialog and directly uses the provided file path.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability can be exploited if the webserver runs with high privileges, giving access to a wider range of files on the server.
*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** If the reporting viewer/designer is embedded in a page without proper authentication, the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, including configuration files (`web.config`, `appsettings.json`) and other potentially confidential data. This data can be used for further exploitation.
*   **Potential for Chained Attacks:** The LFI vulnerability can be combined with remote code execution (as mentioned in the document, although not directly related to this specific CVE) to present data without rendering it in a report.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Path Input:** An attacker can directly input a file path (e.g., `C:\windows\temp\localfile.json`) into the data source configuration of the Reporting Designer.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the web interface of the Reporting Designer, typically embedded in a webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required (in some cases):** If the reporting viewer or designer is embedded in a page that lacks authentication, the attacker does not need any specific privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the Stimulsoft Reporting Designer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor initially considered the functionality "by design", but then agreed to fix it after the researchers demonstrated the potential impact.
*   The vendor has added a configuration option to prevent loading of local files as a fix.
*   The vulnerability can read XML and JSON like files.
*   The severity of the issue is rated as 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).
