- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP VR Plugin (<= 8.2.7) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability exists within the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or actions within the WordPress site. The specific impact would vary based on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a crafted request that leverages a user's existing session within the affected WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious request and induce a logged-in user to execute the request (e.g., by enticing the user to click a link or visit a malicious page). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
