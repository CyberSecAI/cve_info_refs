Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of static, hardcoded secrets within Stimulsoft Designer (both Desktop and Web versions) to encrypt connection strings in `.mrt` files. These static secrets are used to encrypt database connection strings within the report files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys:** The core issue is that the encryption keys used to protect connection strings are static and embedded within the Stimulsoft application's code.
*   **Lack of Obfuscation:** The Stimulsoft application does not employ any obfuscation techniques, making it easy to extract the static secrets through decompilation.
*   **Consistent Keys Across Versions:** The same static secrets are used across different versions and installations, meaning once an attacker has the key they can use it for many systems/reports.
*   **Weak Encryption:** The custom encryption algorithm used is not standard and is easily reversible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Database Credentials:** An attacker can decrypt the connection strings present in `.mrt` files, which could include sensitive information such as database usernames, passwords, server addresses, and database names.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Databases:** With the leaked credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the databases, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the exposed database credentials are used on other systems it could lead to lateral movement in a network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to `.mrt` Files:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to `.mrt` report files containing encrypted connection strings.
*   **Decompilation:** Attackers can decompile the Stimulsoft Designer application to extract the static encryption keys.
*   **Public Availability:** The vulnerability is made easier to exploit by the availability of example source code, including the necessary functions for decryption, publicly available on GitHub.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to `.mrt` Files:** The attacker needs to obtain at least one .mrt file.
*   **Ability to Decompile .NET Applications:** The attacker needs the ability to decompile the Stimulsoft Designer application to find the static encryption key.
*   **Basic Programming Knowledge:** The attacker needs some basic programming knowledge to use the extracted key to decrypt the connection strings, though the provided sample code makes this task easier.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack doesn't require user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was contacted and acknowledged the issue but decided not to fix it, stating the encryption was only for obfuscation, not security.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.9, indicating high severity.
*   The researchers were able to obtain the static secrets by downloading a trial version of the software.

In summary, CVE-2023-25263 exposes a critical vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded, static secrets for encrypting connection strings in Stimulsoft Designer report files, leading to potential unauthorized database access if attackers can obtain the keys and report files.
