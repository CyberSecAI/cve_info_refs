The vulnerability lies within the Ofbd component in AMI SBIOS of NVIDIA DGX-1. It involves a preconditioned heap that allows a user with elevated privileges to perform an access beyond the end of a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds access due to an insufficient bounds check when handling a preconditioned heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution
- Escalation of privileges
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- The scope of the impact can extend to other components.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access
- Requires a preconditioned heap

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have elevated privileges.
- Attacker needs to be able to precondition the heap in a way that triggers the out-of-bounds access.
