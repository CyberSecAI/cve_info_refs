Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-25116:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an unsafe use of the `sprintf` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of the Milesight UR32L router. Specifically, user-controlled data is incorporated into the format string of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The `sprintf` function writes data into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) on the stack. When the size of the input data exceeds the buffer's capacity, it leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer with specially crafted data, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, including return addresses. This can be leveraged to gain control of the program's execution flow and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerable code is reachable through the router's `/cgi` endpoint. The attacker sends a POST request with a specific JSON structure to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have high privileges on the device to send HTTP requests that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Specific Vulnerable Code Details (CVE-2023-25116):**

-   **Function:** `set_openvpn_client`
-   **Vulnerable Parameters:**  The `local_virtual_ip` and `remote_virtual_ip` JSON keys are used to fetch their respective string values.
-   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```c
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"ip address static local %s peer %s",local_virtual_ip,remote_virtual_ip);
    ```
-   **Explanation:**  The values associated with the `local_virtual_ip` and `remote_virtual_ip` keys from the JSON request are directly inserted into the `sprintf` function's format string without any size checks. This allows an attacker to provide an overly long `local_virtual_ip` string which will overflow the `vtysh_command_buffer` buffer
