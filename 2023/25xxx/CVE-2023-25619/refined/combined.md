Modicon PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and PACs
(Programmable Automation Controllers)

11 April 2023 (13 August 2024)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its Modicon PLCs (Programmable Logic
Controllers) and PACs (Programmable Automation Controllers).

Modicon PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and PACs (Programmable Automation
Controllers) control and monitor industrial operations in a sustainable, flexible, efficient, and
protected way.

Failure to apply the remediations and mitigations provided below may risk a denial of service of
the controller, which could result in disrupted operations.

August 2024 Update: A remediation is available for Modicon M580 CPU Safety (page 2).

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-25619

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.5 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists that could
cause denial of service of the controller when communicating over the Modbus TCP protocol.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-25620

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.5 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists that could
cause denial of service of the controller when a malicious project file is loaded onto the
controller by an authenticated user.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

Mitigations

•  Setup an application password in the project properties.
•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access

to port 502/TCP.

For Modicon Controllers, when loading a project file through EcoStruxure™ Control Expert,
ensure the following:

•  Enable the file encryption feature for all new projects.
•  Encrypt project files when stored and restrict the access to only trusted users.
•  When exchanging files over the network, use secure communication protocols.
•  Only open project files received from trusted source, and it is recommended to share

project files only when configured with the encryption feature.

In addition, the following specific mitigations apply:

Schneider Electric’s Modicon Premium & Quantum controllers have
reached their end of life and are no longer commercially available. They
have been replaced by the Modicon M580 ePAC controller, our most
current product offer.

Customers should strongly consider migrating to the Modicon M580
ePAC. Please contact your local Schneider Electric technical support for
more information.

To mitigate the risks users should immediately:

•  Configure the Access Control List following the

recommendations of the user manual “Premium and Atrium
using EcoStruxure™ Control Expert – Ethernet Network
Modules, User Manual” in chapters “Connection configuration
parameters / TCP/IP Services Configuration Parameters /

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

11-Apr-23 (13-Aug-24) Document Reference Number – SEVD-2023-101-05 (v4.0.0) Page 7 of 9

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
