Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-25830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means that the application doesn't properly neutralize or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into a web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, where malicious scripts are embedded within a crafted URL. When a victim clicks this URL, the script is executed within the context of their browser.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The application fails to properly sanitize or neutralize user-supplied input, specifically within URL query parameters. This allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Links:** The attack vector is through crafted links that contain malicious JavaScript code within the URL query parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use social engineering tactics to trick users into clicking the malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have prior access to the system.
- **Ability to Create Crafted Links:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Affected Versions:**
- Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9.1, 10.8.1, and 10.7.1.

**Mitigation:**
- The provided mitigation strategy is to use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter JavaScript from URL query parameters. This prevents the malicious scripts from being executed.

**Additional Notes**
- The content provides more details about the vulnerability, its impact and the affected versions than the official CVE description which is a placeholder.
