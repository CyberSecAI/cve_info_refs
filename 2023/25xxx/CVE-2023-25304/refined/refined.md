- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability during the manual installation of `.mrpack` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize file paths within the `.mrpack` archive, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can place or replace scripts or config files at arbitrary locations on the user's system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. Exploitation requires the user to import a malicious `.mrpack` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious `.mrpack` file with specific file paths to exploit the path traversal vulnerability. The attacker needs to convince the user to import this crafted `.mrpack` file.
