- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages CSRF to make authenticated users perform actions by tricking them into loading a malicious page or link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged in user into visiting a malicious page or link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
