**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, meaning it doesn't properly validate the origin of requests.

- The vulnerable versions are <= 3.0.2.
- The fix is available in version 4.0.0.
- The severity is considered low.
