{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `vtysh_ubus` binary uses `sprintf` with user-controlled data, leading to buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the use of `sprintf` with unsanitized, user-controlled input.",
      "Multiple vulnerable functions within the `vtysh_ubus` binary share a pattern where parameters parsed from `blobmsg` structures are used in `sprintf` calls."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to trigger the overflow and potentially gain full control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are triggered via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a high-privileged user to send the malicious HTTP requests."
