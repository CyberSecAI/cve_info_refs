- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NULL pointer dereference in `cuobjdump`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The tool `cuobjdump` does not handle malformed binary input properly, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can cause a limited denial of service by running `cuobjdump` on a malformed binary.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user provides a malformed binary as input to `cuobjdump`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute `cuobjdump` with a crafted binary. The user must also trick the vulnerable software into processing the crafted binary.
