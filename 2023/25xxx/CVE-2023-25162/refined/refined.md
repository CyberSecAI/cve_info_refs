Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-25162

**Description:** This CVE relates to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Nextcloud server due to insufficient IP filtering.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from lax checking on IP addresses, specifically the failure to properly sanitize or normalize IP addresses provided by a user. Attackers can use encoded or non-standard representations of IP addresses to bypass the existing filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient IP Filtering:** The primary weakness is the inadequate validation of IP addresses, which allows for bypass using unusual character encodings like full-width numbers.
*   **SSRF:** The lack of proper filtering enables an attacker to perform SSRF attacks by providing an IP address that is not correctly identified as a private/local one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SSRF:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to make requests to internal or restricted resources that the Nextcloud server has access to.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as metadata on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious IP Payloads:** The attacker crafts a request to the server that contains a specially encoded IP address. An example provided is `⑯⑨。②⑤④。⑯⑨｡②⑤④` which resolves to 169.254.169.254

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Nextcloud server where IP addresses are being processed or validated. This might include but not limited to requests to fetch files, etc.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server versions prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12.
*   Patches are available in versions 24.0.8 and 23.0.12, which include improved IP validation.
*   The fix includes changes to `lib/private/Http/Client/DnsPinMiddleware.php` and `lib/private/Http/Client/LocalAddressChecker.php`.
*   The fix introduces usage of a third-party library `mlocati/ip-lib` to handle IP normalization, along with `urldecode` and `idn_to_utf8` calls for address checking.

In summary, this vulnerability arises from Nextcloud's failure to properly normalize IP addresses, allowing attackers to bypass filtering mechanisms and perform SSRF attacks. The fix involves utilizing an external library to correctly handle IP addresses, along with normalization and decoding to prevent bypass.
