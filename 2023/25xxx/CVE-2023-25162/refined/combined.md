But as our code translates the IP to v4 if it maps, maybe it is not a problem. |

# SSRF via filter bypass due to lax checking on IPs

Moderate

[miaulalala](/miaulalala)
published
GHSA-mqrx-grp7-244m
Feb 13, 2023

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 24.0.8, < 23.0.12

## Patched versions

24.0.8, 23.0.12

Server (Enterprise)
(Nextcloud)

< 24.0.8, < 23.0.12

24.0.8, 23.0.12

## Description

### Impact

Attackers can leverage enclosed alphanumeric payloads to bypass IP filters and gain SSRF. An example can be using ⑯⑨。②⑤④。⑯⑨｡②⑤④ which would allow an attacker to read crucial metadata if the server is hosted on the AWS platform. The above payload will resolve to the magic IP of AWS namely 169.254.169.254 but bypasses all the filtering present in the code itself.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.8 or 23.0.12

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 24.0.8 or 23.0.12
