Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when saving dashboard configurations in DataEase. Specifically, the `propValue` field within saved dashboard data is vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input within the dashboard's configuration data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the `propValue` field. This malicious code is then stored in the application's database. When other users view or interact with the dashboard, the injected script executes in their browsers, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected dashboard.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker may be able to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from the victim.
- **Account Takeover:** By stealing session tokens, an attacker can impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The injected script can redirect users to malicious websites, thereby launching phishing attacks.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the dashboard in an unauthorized way, leading to application defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Dashboard Configuration:** The attacker needs to modify the saved dashboard data, specifically the `propValue` field, to inject the malicious script.
- **Data Manipulation:** This would likely involve intercepting/modifying the data being sent to the server when a dashboard is saved or updated by an authorized user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the DataEase application, capable of saving or updating dashboard configurations.
- **Access to Dashboard Configuration:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the dashboard data stored on the server, specifically the `propValue` field, either through the application's interface or by manipulating the data being sent to the server.

**Additional Details (from code diffs):**
- The fix involves using the `xss` library to sanitize the content of `propValue` before rendering it on the page. Specifically, changes were made in the following files:
   - `frontend/src/components/canvas/customComponent/DeRichText.vue`
   - `frontend/src/components/canvas/customComponent/DeRichTextView.vue`
   - `frontend/src/components/canvas/customComponent/VText.vue`
- A global `$xss` method was added in `frontend/src/main.js` to make the xss library available to Vue components.
- The `xss` dependency was added in `frontend/package.json`.
- The commit message in the code diffs mentions "refactor: 仪表板防范XSS攻击", which translates to "refactor: Dashboard prevents XSS attacks".

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-25807 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the DataEase platform that allows an authenticated user to inject malicious code by manipulating saved dashboard configurations. When other users access the vulnerable dashboard, the malicious scripts are executed within their browsers, potentially causing serious damage. The fix includes sanitizing user inputs with an xss library before they're rendered.
