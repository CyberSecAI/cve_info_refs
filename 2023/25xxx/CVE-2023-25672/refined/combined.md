# NPE in LookupTableImportV2

Moderate

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-94mm-g2mv-8p7r
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.12.0, 2.11.1

## Description

### Impact

The function `tf.raw_ops.LookupTableImportV2` cannot handle scalars in the `values` parameter and gives an NPE.

```
import tensorflow as tf

v = tf.Variable(1)

@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
def test():
   func = tf.raw_ops.LookupTableImportV2
   para={'table_handle': v.handle,'keys': [62.98910140991211, 94.36528015136719], 'values': -919}

   y = func(**para)
   return y

print(test())
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [980b22536abcbbe1b4a5642fc940af33d8c19b69](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/980b22536abcbbe1b4a5642fc940af33d8c19b69).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx of 360 AIVul Team

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-25672

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
