The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Reviewer Management System v1.0 by janobe.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `course-update.php` file, specifically within the handling of the `courseID` parameter via a GET request. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `courseID` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- The attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data.
- The attacker can potentially escalate privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP GET request to `reviewer_0/admins/assessments/course/course-update.php` with a crafted value for the `courseID` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
