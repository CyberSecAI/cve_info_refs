Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-25768:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Azure Credentials Plugin does not perform proper permission checks in methods that implement form validation. Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:**  The plugin lacks proper permission checks in form validation methods.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation methods don't require POST requests making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified web server.
*   CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent, potentially causing unauthorized connections to malicious servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit the missing permission checks and CSRF vulnerability through crafted HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
