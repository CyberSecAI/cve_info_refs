Regular expressions wouldn't catch the newlines or possibly other control characters. Now we'll use the TAG validation code to make sure the inputs are only plain ASCII printables first.

| [@manolama](https://github.com/manolama) - this seems to fix the [RCE we reported](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/issues/2261) before Synopsis on Dec 12, 2022. Seems like they have also issued a CVE for the vulnerability we found. Could you please open a Github security advisory? Thanks. |

## Overview

The Black Duck Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) has discovered a remote command execution vulnerability [(CVE-2023-25826)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25826), and a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability[(CVE-2023-25827)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25827) in OpenTSDB. OpenTSDB is a distributed time series database (TSDB) working over Apache HBase that is designed for managing, querying, and displaying time-based metrics at a large scale.

CVE-2023-25826: Due to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy HTTP query API, it is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple parameters and execute malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system. This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass validation.

CVE-2023-25827: Due to insufficient validation of parameters reflected in error messages by the legacy HTTP query API and the logging endpoint, it is possible to inject and execute malicious JavaScript within the browser of a targeted OpenTSDB user. This issue shares the same root cause as CVE-2018-13003, a reflected XSS vulnerability with the suggestion endpoint.

## Exploitation

CVE-2023-25826: When supplying requests to the legacy HTTP query API (the ‘/q’ endpoint), crafted system commands can be injected into the ‘key’, ‘style’, and ‘smooth’ parameters that will bypass validation measures. When a request is submitted, parameters are passed to a graph generation shell script where included commands will be executed.

CVE-2023-25827: Malicious URLs can be crafted and supplied to a victim, and they cause request errors for the legacy HTTP query API (the ‘/q’ endpoint) and the logging ‘/logs’ endpoint. Arbitrary JavaScript can be injected into the ‘start’, ‘end’, ‘m’, and ‘key’ parameters of ‘/q’, and the ‘level’ parameter of ‘/logs’. If a victim accesses a crafted URL, included JavaScript will be reflected in the resulting error message and executed within their browser.

## Affected software

* OpenTSDB releases 1.0.0 up to and including 2.4.1

## Impact

Exploitation of CVE-2023-25826 can lead to the injection of arbitrary OS commands that will be executed by the host system within the privileges of the OpenTSDB application.

Exploitation of CVE-2023-25827 can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the browser of a targeted user, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information retained by their browser, such as configured authentication tokens or session cookies.

CVE-2023-25826

* CVSS base score: 9.8 (Critical)
* CVSS 3.1 Vector: CVSS3.1/[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

CVE-2023-25827

* CVSS base score: 8.2 (High)
* CVSS 3.1 Vector: CVSS3.1/[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)
