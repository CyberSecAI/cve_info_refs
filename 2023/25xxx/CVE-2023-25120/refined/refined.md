Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-25120:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an unsafe use of `sprintf` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, user-controlled data from the "cisco\_secret" JSON key is passed to `sprintf` without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is the use of `sprintf` with user-supplied input without verifying its length, leading to a classic buffer overflow. This is a common mistake in C programming and opens the door to memory corruption and code execution.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected Milesight UR32L device. This gives the attacker complete control over the router, allowing them to perform malicious actions like eavesdropping, network manipulation, or using the router as part of a botnet.

*  **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint. The request must include a JSON payload with the `cisco_secret` key containing a string exceeding the buffer's capacity.

*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have high privileges (e.g., be a logged-in administrator) on the router to send the malicious HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Specifics for CVE-2023-25120:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_dmvpn`
*   **Vulnerable JSON Key:** `cisco_secret`
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

    ```c
    is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"cisco_secret");
    if (is_equal == 0) {
        cisco_secret = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
        if (*cisco_secret != '\0') {
            command_format_string = "ip nhrp authentication %s";
            [...]
        }
    }
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,command_format_string,cisco_secret);
    ```

*   **Exploit Proof of Concept:** The following JSON payload will trigger the vulnerability:

    ```json
    {
        "id": 9,
        "execute": 1,
        "core": "yruo_vpn_dmvpn",
        "function": "set",
        "values": [
            {
                "base": "yruo_vpn_dmvpn",
                "index": 1,
                "value": {
                    "cisco_secret": "A"*0x600
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report highlights a series of similar vulnerabilities within the `vtysh_ubus` binary, all stemming from the same pattern of unsafe `sprintf` usage.
*   The vendor did not issue a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.
