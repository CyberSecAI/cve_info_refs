Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
-  A logic error in how Firefox handled storage access within Private Browsing Mode (PBM), specifically related to the DOM Cache API.
- A change introduced in bug 1758745 intended to prevent access to unpartitioned cache storage when always partitioning is enabled, had the unintended side effect of also allowing it for PBM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ServiceWorker Cache Leak in PBM:** Under specific conditions, the ServiceWorker's offline cache was written to the file system even when using private browsing mode. This violated the privacy expectations of PBM.
- **Incorrect Storage Access Check:** The storage access check was returning `ePartitionTrackersOrDeny` instead of  `ePrivateBrowsing` in PBM, which bypassed intended restrictions.
- **Persistence of Cache:** The leaked cache data persisted across private browsing sessions, allowing a website to track users even in PBM.
- **Lack of Proper Cleanup:** The leaked data was not being cleared automatically after the private browsing session ended which increased the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Websites could track users across private browsing sessions, undermining the purpose of PBM. This is a significant privacy risk.
- **Information Disclosure:** Data intended to be private was being written to disk and made potentially available to other sessions or users who had access to the file system.
- **Cross-Session Tracking:** Websites could access the cached data to track if a user had visited the site before, even within PBM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based:** A malicious or compromised website could use the ServiceWorker and DOM Cache APIs to trigger the leak.
- **Third-Party Context:** The issue was present in third-party iframes, increasing the exploitability on various websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Control:** Attackers need control over a website or third-party content within a webpage to exploit the issue.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to visit the malicious website or a page with the malicious third-party content.
- **Firefox User in PBM:** The user must be using Firefox in Private Browsing Mode for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by a change in how Firefox handles partitioned storage ([bug 1758745](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1758745)).
*   The fix involved explicitly denying storage access for the DOM Cache API in PBM.
*   A cleanup patch was implemented to clear the leaked data from disk, but it relies on the user starting a private browsing session after the fix to trigger the deletion of the leaked files.
*   The issue was rated as high severity due to the potential for cross-session tracking and data leakage in PBM.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox 111 and Firefox 112.
