```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data when constructing commands for the `vtysh` service. This occurs within various functions of the `vtysh_ubus` binary, where parameters from HTTP POST requests are parsed, and then used in a `sprintf` call, leading to a buffer overflow if the provided data exceeds the buffer's capacity.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) in the `vtysh_command_buffer` due to unsafe usage of `sprintf`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint. The specific vulnerable function is determined by the 'core' and 'function' parameters within the JSON payload, and the overflow is achieved by providing overly long string values for certain keys within the 'values' array.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user on the device to send the malicious HTTP requests that trigger these vulnerabilities."
