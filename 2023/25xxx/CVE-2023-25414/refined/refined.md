    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated session termination."
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows an unauthenticated attacker to force a logout of valid users. This can be abused to deny other users access to the web interface, for example to prevent that shut down infrastructure is powered up again.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the web interface to terminate a user's session.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to reach the web interface via the network."
  }
