# Integer overflow in EditDistance

Moderate

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-7jvm-xxmr-v5cw
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.11.1, 2.12.0

## Description

### Impact

TFversion 2.11.0 //tensorflow/core/ops/array\_ops.cc:1067 const Tensor\* hypothesis\_shape\_t = c->input\_tensor(2); std::vector dims(hypothesis\_shape\_t->NumElements() - 1); for (int i = 0; i < dims.size(); ++i) { dims[i] = c->MakeDim(std::max(h\_values(i), t\_values(i))); }

if hypothesis\_shape\_t is empty, hypothesis\_shape\_t->NumElements() - 1 will be integer overflow, and the it will deadlock

```
import tensorflow as tf
para={
    'hypothesis_indices': [[]],
    'hypothesis_values': ['tmp/'],
    'hypothesis_shape': [],
    'truth_indices': [[]],
    'truth_values': [''],
    'truth_shape': [],
    'normalize': False
    }
tf.raw_ops.EditDistance(**para)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [08b8e18643d6dcde00890733b270ff8d9960c56c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/08b8e18643d6dcde00890733b270ff8d9960c56c).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
