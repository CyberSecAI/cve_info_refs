Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Stimulsoft reporting tools (.mrt files) allow embedding C# source code.
- While some restrictions are in place to prevent remote code execution (e.g., limiting access to `System.Net.HTTPClient` and `System.Net.Sockets`), there is no restriction on accessing the local file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unrestricted Local File System Access:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of embedded C# code to access the local file system, enabling malicious file operations.
- **Lack of Code Sandboxing:** The C# code within the reports is not executed in a sandboxed environment, allowing it to interact directly with the system.
- **Default Configuration:** The vulnerability exists due to a property that allows code execution that is not set by default, but can be set. The vendor did not believe it was their responsibility to change the default behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine.
- **File System Manipulation:** Attackers can read, write, modify, or delete files on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Reports:** An attacker creates a specially crafted .mrt report file with embedded C# code that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Distribution of Malicious Reports:** The attacker must distribute the malicious .mrt report to the victim, for example through a website lacking authentication that embed the viewer/designer or through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create .mrt report file:** The attacker needs to be able to create/modify a .mrt report file.
- **No privileges required**: The attacker doesn't require any specific privileges on the system, as long as the viewer/designer is embedded in a page lacking authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Stimulsoft Designer (Desktop), Stimulsoft Designer (Web), and Stimulsoft Viewer (Web) versions 2023.1 and 2023.1.3 and is allegedly present in 2023.1.4.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2023.2.1.
- The vendor initially considered the behavior as "by design," stating it was the responsibility of the developer embedding the components to secure it, but later agreed to disable code compilation by default.
- A proof of concept is not disclosed but code examples can be found at the provided github link.
