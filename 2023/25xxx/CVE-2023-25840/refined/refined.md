- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79) in the ArcGIS REST Services directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by creating and tricking them into clicking crafted content.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can create crafted content in the ArcGIS REST Services directory, which when accessed by a victim, triggers the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with low privileges to create the crafted content. The victim needs to click on the crafted content to trigger the execution of the malicious script.
