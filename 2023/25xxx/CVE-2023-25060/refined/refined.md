- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could perform higher privileged actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable function, which is exposed to unauthenticated users.
