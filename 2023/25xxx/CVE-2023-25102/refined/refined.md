Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-25102:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data within the `set_dmvpn` function of the `vtysh_ubus` binary. The `sprintf` function is used to format a command string, but it doesn't perform bounds checking on the input, leading to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `vtysh_command_buffer`, a local buffer on the stack, is overflowed due to the unsafe use of `sprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer with a specially crafted payload, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint of the Milesight UR32L router. This request must include specific JSON data to reach the vulnerable `set_dmvpn` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user to send the necessary HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerable code path in `vtysh_ubus`.

**Specific Vulnerable Code:**

The vulnerability lies within the following code snippet:

```c
is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"hub_ip");
if (is_equal == 0) {
	hub_ip = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
}
else {
	is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"hub_gre_ip");
	if (is_equal == 0) {
		hub_gre_ip = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
	}
}
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"ip nhrp map %s %s",hub_ip,hub_gre_ip);
```

This code reads the `hub_ip` and `hub_gre_ip` values from the JSON request and uses them in an `sprintf` call, without validating their size.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**

The provided JSON payload demonstrates how to trigger the overflow:

```json
{
	"id": 6,
	"execute": 1,
	"core": "yruo_vpn_dmvpn",
	"function": "set",
	"values": [
		{
			"base": "yruo_vpn_dmvpn",
			"index": 1,
			"value": {
				"hub_ip":"A"*0x300,
				"hub_gre_ip":"POC"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

In this example, a large string ("A"*0x300) is provided for `hub_ip`, which will overflow `vtysh_command_buffer`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report states that the `vtysh_ubus` binary is vulnerable.
*   The affected product is Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
*   The CVSSv3 score is 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity.
