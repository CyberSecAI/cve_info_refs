Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-25110:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-25110
*   **Description:** The vulnerability exists in the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. It's a buffer overflow caused by the use of an unsafe `sprintf` pattern.
*   **Root Cause:** The `set_gre` function, when handling the `remote_virtual_ip` JSON key, uses `sprintf` to construct a command. User-controlled data from the `remote_virtual_ip` key is passed to `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.
*  **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```c
    is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"remote_virtual_ip");
    if (is_equal == 0) {
            vtysh_command_argument = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
            vtysh_command_format = "ip address peer %s";
            [...]
    }
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,vtysh_command_format,vtysh_command_argument);
    ```
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the usage of `sprintf` with user-provided input (`remote_virtual_ip`) without proper size validation before copying it into the fixed-size buffer `vtysh_command_buffer`. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation leads to a stack-based buffer overflow, which can allow arbitrary code execution on the router.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint. The request includes a JSON payload with a specific structure to target the vulnerable code path in the `set_gre` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user on the router to send the malicious HTTP request.

**Exploit Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the crash:
    ```json
    {
        "id": 9,
        "execute": 1,
        "core": "yruo_vpn_gre",
        "function": "set",
        "values": [
            {
                "base": "yruo_vpn_gre",
                "index": 1,
                "value": {
                    "remote_virtual_ip": "A"*0x300,
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
*   The PoC sends a large string of "A" characters as the value for the `remote_virtual_ip` field, causing the `sprintf` function to write beyond the bounds of the `vtysh_command_buffer`, leading to a crash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is one of many buffer overflows found within the `vtysh_ubus` binary. The report lists 43 other CVEs in relation to this issue.
*   The report mentions that the vendor did not release a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.
