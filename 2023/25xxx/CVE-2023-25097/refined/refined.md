Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-25097:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L routers. This unsafe usage allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the buffer allocated for the `vtysh_command_buffer`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a stack-based buffer overflow because the `vtysh_command_buffer` is likely allocated on the stack.
- Unsafe use of `sprintf` with attacker controlled inputs allows to write beyond buffer limits

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- **Device Compromise:** Complete compromise of the router, potentially allowing attackers to control network traffic, access internal networks, and perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint.
- **JSON Data:** The requests must include specific JSON data with oversized values for the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high privileged user on the device in order to send the malicious HTTP requests that trigger the vulnerable code paths.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the device's API to craft valid requests with the malicious payloads.

**Specific Vulnerability (CVE-2023-25097):**

-   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_qos`
-   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `attach_class`
-   **Vulnerable Code:**

    ```c
    is_string = strcmp(table_key,"attach_class");
    if (is_string == 0) {
    	attach_class = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
    }
    [...]
    if ((action != -1 && rule_name != (char *)0x0) && (*rule_name != '\0')) {
        if (action == 3) {
            [...]
        }
        else {
            [...]
            if (attach_class != 0) {
                sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"match class %s",attach_class);
                exec_cmd_no_return_debug(vtysh_command_buffer,"qos_ubus.c");
            }
            [...]
        }
    }
    ```

-   **Explanation:** The `attach_class` value from the JSON data is used directly in a `sprintf` call to build a command. If the `attach_class` value is longer than the buffer allocated for `vtysh_command_buffer`, a buffer overflow will occur.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document provides Proof-of-Concept (PoC) JSON payloads that trigger the crash for each vulnerability, aiding in understanding the exploit.
- There are numerous similar vulnerabilities in the `vtysh_ubus` binary due to this common pattern of unsafe `sprintf` usage, as noted by the multiple CVE IDs listed in the report.
