- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Shoppable Images Lite WordPress plugin versions 1.2.3 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the website while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is possible through a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
