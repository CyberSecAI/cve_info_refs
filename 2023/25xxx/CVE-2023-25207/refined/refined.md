Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `dpdfrance::ajaxSetAddressOrder()` method of the "DPD France" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the parameters `street`, `zip`, `city`, and `phone` are directly inserted into an SQL query without using the `pSQL` function for sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query through the vulnerable parameters. This is a blind SQL injection as indicated in the description.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data leaks:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive technical and personal data from the database.
- **Privilege escalation:** Attackers could gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
- **Data manipulation/deletion:**  Attackers could remove all data from the linked PrestaShop.
- **Sensitive information exposure:** Attackers could expose sensitive tables on the front-office, potentially revealing protected module ajax scripts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via HTTP POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No privileges needed:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction:** No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
- **Access to the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to `/modules/dpdfrance/ajax.php`. The token `dpdfrance_token` can be obtained from the front-office of the website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the DPD France module prior to 6.1.3.
- The fix involves using the `pSQL()` function to properly escape user inputs before inserting them into the SQL query, as shown in the provided patch.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates a blind SQL injection using a sleep statement to confirm the vulnerability.
- The advisory also warns about a new issue present in version 6.1.3, emphasizing the need to remain vigilant for future updates.
- The advisory provides further hardening advice for PrestaShop installations such as using a random database prefix, enabling OWASP WAF rules, and upgrading PrestaShop.
