The provided content relates to CVE-2023-25818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The password reset functionality lacked brute-force protection, allowing an attacker to repeatedly try password reset tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing brute-force protection on the password reset token validation.
- The password reset token had 62^21 possible combinations, making it theoretically brute-forceable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user could potentially reset the password of another user by brute-forcing the reset token.
- This would lead to unauthorized access to the victim's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to initiate the password reset process for the target user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges are required.
- No user interaction is needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the password reset endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the user's ID to initiate the password reset process.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing brute-force protection for the password reset functionality.
- The fix involved adding the `@BruteForceProtection` annotation to the `passwordResetEmail` action in the `LostController.php` file.
- The fix was backported to multiple stable versions of Nextcloud.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 6.5 (Moderate).
- The associated CWE is CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts).
