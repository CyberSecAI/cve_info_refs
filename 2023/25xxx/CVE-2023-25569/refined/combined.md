## Highlights

### Admin Tools Enhancement

**User management enhancement**

The user management page now has a list view of all users and administrators can easily find a specific user to edit.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214000909-aed31d2b-a69d-4023-9de5-e6d5826b074c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214000909-aed31d2b-a69d-4023-9de5-e6d5826b074c.png)

**System configuration enhancement**

The system configuration page now has a list view of all configuration items of PortalDB as well as ConfigDB. Administrators can easily find a specific configuration item to edit.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214001786-6118261a-caca-4945-b43d-6eed6e94c0ff.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214001786-6118261a-caca-4945-b43d-6eed6e94c0ff.png)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214195645-49c32eda-382c-4db0-bfcd-577e5908dbbb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214195645-49c32eda-382c-4db0-bfcd-577e5908dbbb.png)

**Open platform authorization management enhancement**

The open platform authorization management page now has a list view of third-party apps and administrators can easily find a specific app to grant permission.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214002894-e95e89b9-7557-4dc3-9cc8-d136cced6db0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214002894-e95e89b9-7557-4dc3-9cc8-d136cced6db0.png)

### Basic Types for Item

Users can now config the types of the item and apollo would do a basic type check based on the type.

The types available now are String(default), Number, Boolean, and JSON.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214005788-736da40c-4974-490e-8fc8-e16d7bed97b2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214005788-736da40c-4974-490e-8fc8-e16d7bed97b2.png)

### Non-properties Namespaces Comparison Feature

The comparison feature for non-properties namespaces is now available.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214736054-27c008b0-ad30-4834-948c-56a851665421.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/214736054-27c008b0-ad30-4834-948c-56a851665421.png)

### Support Database as the Service Registry for apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice

Apollo now supports the use of database as the service registry, without relying on a third-party service registry such as eureka.

See [database-discovery](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide?id=_2235-database-discovery) for more information.

### Breaking Changes

As was discussed in [#4353](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/discussions/4353), apollo drops the support for the flyway database migration tool.

## Installation

Please refer to the [Distributed Deployment Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide).

## How to upgrade from v2.0.1 to v2.1.0

* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/v2.2.0/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB
* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:
  + apollo-configservice
  + apollo-adminservice
  + apollo-portal
* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see [spring-projects/spring-security#9204](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204)

```
use ApolloPortalDB;
delete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;
delete from `SPRING_SESSION`;
```
