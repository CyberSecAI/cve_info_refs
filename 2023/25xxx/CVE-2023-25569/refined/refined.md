Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25569:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in the `apollo-portal` component of the Apollo configuration management system. Specifically, the cookie's `SameSite` attribute was not set to `Lax` or `Strict`, which would have prevented unauthorized cross-site requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by an authenticated administrator when they visit a compromised website.
- **Missing `SameSite` attribute:** The absence of a proper `SameSite` attribute on session cookies allowed the browser to include cookies in cross-site requests, making the CSRF attack possible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Role Assignment:** A low-privileged user can create a malicious webpage. If an authenticated portal administrator visits this page, the malicious page can send a request to the Apollo portal to assign new roles to the low-privileged user without the admin's knowledge or consent.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher privileges within the Apollo system by assigning themselves admin roles, potentially leading to a compromise of the application's configuration data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Webpage:** The attack vector involves a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker, which is visited by a logged-in administrator.
- **Cross-site Request:** The malicious webpage sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Apollo portal application, leveraging the admin's active session cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low-privileged user account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the Apollo system, although they do not need administrator privileges to perform this attack.
- **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious web page or inject malicious code into a trusted webpage that will be visited by a logged-in admin.
- **Administrator unawareness:** The attack is successful if a logged-in admin visits the attacker's webpage.

**Additional Details**
- The fix for the vulnerability is implemented by setting `server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=Lax` in the application configuration, as noted in the commit.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.1.0 of Apollo.
- A workaround is to not visit any untrusted pages.
