The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25111.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data within the `set_gre` function of the `vtysh_ubus` binary in Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, the `key` parameter from a JSON request is directly used in a `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the use of `sprintf` with unchecked user-supplied input.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization for the `key` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, potentially allowing them to inject and execute malicious code on the device.
- Device compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the router, enabling attackers to perform various malicious activities such as data exfiltration, denial-of-service attacks, or further network compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint. These requests contain a JSON payload that includes the malicious `key` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- High privileges: The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user on the device to send these requests and trigger the vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's `/cgi` endpoint, requiring network access to the device.
