We would like to take this opportunity to address, clarify and respond to some of the arguments made about OneKey.

TLDR,

* **No one is affected.**
* **All disclosed vulnerabilities have been or are being fixed.**
* **We have set the gold standard for security collaboration on open source projects.**
* **Be transparent, keep building, and ignore the FUD.**

# The Gold Standard for Secure Collaboration on Open Source Projects

Earlier this year, we received a responsible disclosure from cybersecurity startup Unciphered that validated a potential vulnerability in the OneKey firmware, and our hardware team has updated the security patch without anyone being affected.

We want to highlight the fact that **these attacks cannot be exploited remotely**. It would require disassembly of the device and physical access through a dedicated FPGA device in the lab to be possible to execute.

Interestingly, in the process of communicating with each other, Unciphered told us that several other world-renowned hardware vendors had similar issues, **while we were the most responsive team and immediately fix the issue**. We also paid Unciphered bounties to thank them for their contributions to OneKey’s security.

We put ourselves in the sun and choose to face and solve problems honestly.

OneKey, one of the few **thoroughly open-source hardware wallets** in the world, has come under the scrutiny of white-hat engineers while clearing its name. It’s a good thing that someone is correcting our mistakes, **giving us the incentive to write world-class, high-quality code**. If you’re interested, you can [our bug bounty program](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/app-monorepo/blob/onekey/docs/BUG_RULES.md) to learn more.

**No one can write perfect code, and even Apple and Google release numerous security patches each year to ensure the security of their devices.**

We do the same, and OneKey’s focus has always been on protecting users from remote attacks. That said, with password phrases and [basic security practices](https://help.onekey.so/hc/en-us/sections/6116008067471-Security-Best-Practices), even physical attacks disclosed by Unciphered will not affect OneKey users. **We regularly release several security patches each year to harden the hardware wallet, keeping progress and transparency in the sun.**

OneKey prioritized open source from the beginning of our hardware architecture selection because we wanted all of our own actions to be verifiable by the community.

**We open-sourced the design and basic code of the secure components, allowing users to verify all important cryptographic operations**.

* How recovery phrases and master private keys are generated from entropy
* How sub-private and public keys are generated/derived
* The signing process occurs entirely within the secure element
* Your private key never leaves the secure element
* Random Number Generation (TRNG)
* Cryptographic algorithms such as ECDSA
* How it protects against physical attacks (bypass attacks)

You can also verify TRNG by running tests such as FIPS 140–2.

However, this choice makes us drop some other security components that are also applicable, and **we are thinking about what is best for users and striking a better balance between open source and security**, and we will have future plans at the end of this article.

# Minimize Trust

The main purpose of hardware wallets has always been to protect users’ money from malware attacks, computer viruses and various other remote dangers.

For example, earlier Trezor revealed the method by which a developer stole all the funds from Ledger through [Stealth Change Address](https://sergeylappo.github.io/ledger-hack/).

**While we would like to achieve perfect physical security, we can only theoretically come infinitely close to doing so, not 100 percent.** When we look at the entire hardware wallet manufacturing process, from silicon crystals to chip code, from firmware to software, it’s safe to say that with enough money, time and resources, any hardware barrier can be breached, even if it’s a nuclear weapon control system.

So, back to reality.

**What the hardware wallet does is effectively increase the cost to the attacker by adding protection.**

To be precise, the hardware wallet isolates your private key from the Internet, thus cutting off the means of remote attacks such as Trojan horses, phishing, computer viruses, etc. **In the real world, the vast majority of attacks are done by remote means.**

**OneKey has made many efforts to prevent supply chain attacks.**

- The majority of our supply chain service providers are from Apple, which allows us to deliver products to the highest standards in the consumer technology industry and ensures that stringent supply chain security management is implemented.
- We’ve added secure components to our hardware wallets and will soon add onboard authentication, which minimizes the risk of supply chain attacks.
- More secure, tamper-proof packaging.

Security education is part of the OneKey team’s role as a hardware wallet provider, and we continue to provide solutions to the community so they can secure their crypto assets from any threat.

# About the Future

We look forward to making the following iterations for future hardware wallets.

* Defend against potential physical attacks by introducing EAL6+ or higher level security components with core business logic to them.
* Shrink the trust area and expand transparency through innovative cross-code, zero-knowledge proof, and PSBT.

Created in 2019, OneKey is one of the most trusted hardware wallet. It offers unparalleled security for cryptocurrencies, two-factor authentication and so on. These features are combined with an easy-to-use interface, whether you are a security expert or a new user.

# Cyber firm cracks OneKey crypto wallets, raises broader questions of hardware security

## The vulnerability has been patched but the episode raises questions about crypto hardware wallets more broadly.

BY
Jeff John Roberts

February 09, 2023 12:31 PM EST

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![](https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/onekey-image.jpg?w=840)

When it comes to privacy and security, many in the world of crypto have long touted hardware wallets as a superior option for holding Bitcoin and other digital assets. For proponents, the benefits of such wallets—small USB-like devices that connect to laptops or cell phones—lie in the fact they are physical devices that can be stored offline, safe from hackers, except for the times an owner wants to make a transaction.

When it comes to privacy and security, many in the world of crypto have long touted hardware wallets as a superior option for holding Bitcoin and other digital assets. For proponents, the benefits of such wallets—small USB-like devices that connect to laptops or cell phones—lie in the fact they are physical devices that can be stored offline, safe from hackers, except for the times an owner wants to make a transaction.

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)

But not everyone is convinced they are always a good idea, including a team of white hat hackers at a cybersecurity startup called [Unciphered](https://www.unciphered.com/). The team has just published [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8OrakRJmHE) that shows them breaking into a device manufactured by OneKey, a Hong-Kong based firm that has [raised](https://www.theblock.co/post/173291/crypto-hardware-wallet-maker-onekey-raises-20-million-in-series-a-funding) $20 million in venture capital and that describes its product as an “open source wallet trusted by millions.”

Unciphered shared a preview version of the video with *Fortune*, explaining that the exploit involved using a “man-in-the-middle” attack to trick the OneKey device into thinking it was still in the factory. By doing this, Unciphered was able to get the device to relay the wallet’s seed phrase—a random, unguessable string of 12 or more words that serves as a password—to another part of the device’s computer system, capturing it along the way.

Taking possession of a seed phrase means it is possible to gain access to the digital assets inside a wallet and steal them by sending them to a different address. Or more simply, it’s like making a copy of the key to someone’s safety deposit box that can be accessed anytime and anywhere.

Here are images showing the exploit, which Unciphered says takes less than a second to conduct once the OneKey device has been disassembled and the “man-in-the-middle” component attached:

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![](https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/onekey-attack.jpg?w=1024&h=704)
![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![](https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/onekey-attack2.jpg?w=1024&h=718)

Yishi Wang, the founder of OneKey, confirmed the existence of the exploit, and told *Fortune* the company has since provided an update to repair it.

“We appreciate the assistance of Unciphered and other security white hats. The firmware vulnerability you mentioned above, which required physical access [and] specialized equipment, has now been fixed,” he said by email.

According to Unciphered, OneKey paid the company $10,000 in the form of a “bug bounty”—a term that describes a reward system, offered by many tech and crypto companies, to encourage white hackers to report and share vulnerabilities in a responsible fashion.

## How safe are hardware wallets, really?

While the existence of vulnerabilities are always cause for concern, the reality is that not all exploits pose a significant real world danger. As the OneKey founder noted in his reply to *Fortune*, the vulnerability discovered by Unciphered required a hacker to have physical access to the device and a high degree of technical proficiency—a very different situation than a software exploit that can be sold or used by a low-level cyber-criminal.

Nonetheless, the danger is still real. According to Eric Michaud, the founder of Unciphered, the sort of person who possesses a hardware wallet typically owns a fair amount of digital assets, and is especially likely to be targeted by sophisticated criminals. He notes that crypto conferences provide a particularly target rich environment for thieves, including those who burgle hotel rooms.

In an interview, Michaud also observed that hardware wallets can provide a false sense of security, leading owners to fail to securely store their device on the false assumption hackers can’t crack it. And while hardware makers provide software updates to harden a device’s security—as OneKey did in response to Unciphered’s discovery—there is also the problem of older wallets whose manufacturer is no longer in business, or held by owners who neglect to update them.

More broadly, Michaud says Unciphered—which is staffed by longtime security researchers, some of whom have held national security clearances—is also concerned about a much broader range of hardware wallets than OneKey.

According to Michaud, multiple hardware wallet manufacturers recycle the same code base to make their products, meaning that a vulnerability discovered in one wallet is often found in other ones. The upshot is that those who rely on hardware wallets to guard their crypto need to remain vigilant.
