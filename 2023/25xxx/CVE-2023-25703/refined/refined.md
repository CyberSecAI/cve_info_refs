- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions intended for higher privileged users. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or to be authenticated.
