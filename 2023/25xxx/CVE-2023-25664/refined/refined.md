Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `AvgPoolGrad` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, it occurs when the `ksize` and `strides` parameters passed to `tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad` are crafted in such a way that leads to out-of-bounds memory access during the backward pass of average pooling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The vulnerability allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The code didn't properly validate the input parameters (`ksize`, `strides`, `orig_input_shape`), which can lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker is able to overwrite important parts of the heap, such as function pointers.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can also cause a crash and lead to denial of service.
- Information Disclosure: In some cases, it might also lead to information disclosure by reading from arbitrary memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted input to `tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad`:  By supplying specifically crafted values for `ksize`, `strides`, `padding`, and `orig_input_shape` parameters of the `AvgPoolGrad` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code with the ability to specify the parameters for the `tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad` operation. This typically means having control over the model or the way TensorFlow is used.

**More details than the CVE description:**
- The provided code snippet from the GitHub commit `ddaac2bdd099bec5d7923dea45276a7558217e5b` shows that the fix involves adding an input validation check for `AvgPoolGrad` to ensure that `ksize` and `strides` are within valid ranges, which was previously missing.
- The provided test case from `pooling_ops_test.py` demonstrates how a carefully chosen set of `strides` could trigger the vulnerability.
- The example code shows how to trigger the vulnerability on CPU.
- The fix included adding checks for the input shapes within `GetBroadcastSize`, as shown by changes in `avgpooling_op.cc`.
