The provided content describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `libtiff`'s `tiffcrop` tool.

**Root Cause:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `extractContigSamplesShifted8bits` function of `tiffcrop.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `extractContigSamplesShifted8bits` function reads beyond the allocated buffer boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing the `tiffcrop` tool to crash.
- Potential for code execution: While the provided content only demonstrates a crash, heap buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for code execution under certain conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious TIFF File: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF file that causes `tiffcrop` to read beyond the allocated buffer in `extractContigSamplesShifted8bits`. Specifically, the provided reproduction steps utilize a file called "poc" that is not included in the provided text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF file that will be processed using the vulnerable `tiffcrop` utility.
- No special privileges are needed.
