Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, the `set_qos` function is vulnerable.
- The root cause is the usage of `sprintf` with user-controlled data, specifically the `rule_name` parameter, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CWE-121:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow
- The `sprintf` function is used to format a command string with user-provided data (`rule_name`) without proper bounds checking. If the provided string is larger than the buffer allocated for the formatted string (`vtysh_command_buffer`), a buffer overflow occurs, potentially overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can leverage this buffer overflow to overwrite parts of the stack, including return addresses, and gain arbitrary code execution on the device.
- **Device compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the router.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP requests:** A specially crafted HTTP POST request with malicious JSON data targeting the `/cgi` endpoint can trigger the vulnerability.
- The request must specify the "core" as "yruo_qos_download" and the "function" as "set".
- The malicious JSON data must include a "rule_list" array with a "rule_name" parameter containing an oversized string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **High privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high privileged user on the device to send the malicious HTTP requests.
