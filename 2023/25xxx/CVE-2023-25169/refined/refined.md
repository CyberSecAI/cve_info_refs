{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Discourse Yearly Review plugin, prior to version 0.2, did not update the username in yearly review topics when a user was anonymized. This resulted in old usernames being present in the generated review topics.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to update user-specific data upon anonymization."
    ],
    "impact": "A user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymized will still have some data linked to its original account, leaking the old username.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack. An attacker could potentially identify the old username of an anonymized user through the yearly review topic."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the affected Discourse instance. No special privileges are required, and user interaction is required for the impact to occur (user is anonymized)",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found in the discourse-yearly-review plugin, versions prior to 0.2. The fix involves updating the raw data of posts containing mentions of the old username upon anonymization of the user. The CVSS score is 3.1 with base metrics of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N."
