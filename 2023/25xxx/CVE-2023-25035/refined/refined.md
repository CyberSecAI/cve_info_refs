- The overall risk is considered "moderately dangerous" and likely to be exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- The attack vector is via a vulnerable function in the WordPress plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication and can be an unprivileged user.
