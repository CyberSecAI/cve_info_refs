- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, a missing authorization check allows a subscriber role user to perform actions that should be limited to higher-privileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is described as low severity, and the likelihood of exploitation is deemed low. However, successful exploitation would allow unauthorized access to functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable function which is missing proper access control, allowing an unprivileged user to perform higher privileged actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber to the WordPress site.
