- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of file extension validation in the Pluck CMS "albums" module, allowing the upload of a crafted JPEG containing an embedded PHP web-shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated remote code execution (RCE) due to insufficient file extension validation when uploading images to albums.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the web server running Pluck CMS.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Authenticated access to the Pluck CMS web interface is required.
    - The attacker must navigate to the albums module and upload a specially crafted JPEG image with an embedded PHP web-shell and an executable extension (.php, .phar, etc.).
    - The attacker then directly navigates to the uploaded file to trigger the RCE.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs valid administrator credentials to access the Pluck CMS web interface.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted JPEG with an embedded PHP web-shell, using a tool such as Jellypeg.
