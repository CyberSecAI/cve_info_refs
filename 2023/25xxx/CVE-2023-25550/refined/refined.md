- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'). Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a maliciously crafted hostname syntax.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code Injection (CWE-94) due to insufficient validation of the hostname parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious hostname parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileged access to exploit the vulnerability.
