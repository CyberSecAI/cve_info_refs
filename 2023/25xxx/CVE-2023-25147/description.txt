An issue in the Trend Micro Apex One agent could allow an attacker who has previously acquired administrative rights via other means to bypass the protection by using a specifically crafted DLL during a specific update process.

Please note: an attacker must first obtain administrative access on the target system via another method in order to exploit this.
