The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25344.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `include` tag in the swig-templates library processes template inclusions. Specifically, the library performs string concatenation of the included file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the path by using the `Object.constructor` property and call it. The injected code is then executed during template rendering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the template rendering process by manipulating the file path used in the `include` tag.
- **Insecure string concatenation:** The library performs string concatenation of the included file path without proper sanitization, which results in code injection.
- **Lack of input validation:** The library fails to properly validate or sanitize the file path provided to the `include` tag, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server where the template is being rendered by injecting malicious JavaScript code. In the provided example, the attacker executes a command to open the Calculator application (`open -a Calculator.app`). This demonstrates that arbitrary system commands can be executed.
- **File Reading:** The attacker is also able to read local file system, as showed in the example, where the attacker is able to read `/etc/passwd` by injecting it into the `include` tag path.
- **Full System Compromise:** In a real-world scenario, the attacker could potentially use the RCE to install malware, compromise the server completely, and gain access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious template file that contains the `include` tag. Within this tag, the attacker injects JavaScript code within the file path by using the `Object.constructor` property. When this template is processed by the vulnerable `swig-templates` library, the injected code is executed by the template rendering engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the template content that is processed by the vulnerable `swig-templates` library.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the template rendering process.
