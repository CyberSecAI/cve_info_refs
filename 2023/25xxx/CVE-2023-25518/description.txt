NVIDIA Jetson contains a vulnerability in CBoot, where the PCIe controller is initialized without IOMMU, which may allow an attacker with physical access to the target device to read and write to arbitrary memory. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and loss of integrity.
