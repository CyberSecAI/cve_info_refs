- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the `/api/jmeter/download/files` endpoint. Anonymous users were able to access this endpoint due to a misconfiguration in ShiroUtil, and the `downloadJmeterFiles` function did not perform any checks on the filename, allowing for arbitrary file downloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper access control (CWE-284)
    - Lack of authentication/authorization checks on file download endpoint.
    - Insufficient input validation on the filename parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download any file from the server without authentication. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, or other data that should not be publicly accessible.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/api/jmeter/download/files`) to download arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker only needs network access to the application and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.
