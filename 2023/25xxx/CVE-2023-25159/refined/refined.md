Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nextcloud handles previews of files when download restrictions are in place. Specifically, when a share is configured to hide downloads and apply a watermark, the preview of the file was still accessible without the watermark, thus bypassing the intended security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness lies in the failure to properly enforce access restrictions on file previews when download hiding is enabled. This resulted in an unauthorized disclosure of content that was intended to be protected by watermarking and hidden downloads.
- **Bypass of Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the watermark and download restrictions on the preview.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to file previews without watermarks can expose sensitive content that was intended to be protected.
- **Information Leakage:** Sensitive information within the files could be disclosed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Local**, as the attacker would need to be a user able to access files on the Nextcloud instance.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with the ability to access a file through a share link requests a file preview where downloads should be restricted and a watermark applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged User:** The attacker must have high privileges to access the Nextcloud instance. They need to be a valid user with the ability to generate a share link with the "hide download" option enabled.
- **Knowledge of a Share Link:** The attacker needs to know the link to a file/folder with hidden downloads enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity according to the CVSS score.
- The fix includes refactoring the watermark checks to properly verify node/share permissions and adding a listener to disable previews for "hide download" shares.
- The fix involved changes in both the Nextcloud server and the Richdocuments app to address the issue completely.
- The vulnerability is tracked with CVE ID CVE-2023-25159 and assigned CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
