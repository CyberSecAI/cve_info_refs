- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on a Data Center Expert (DCE) file upload endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tampering with parameters over HTTP when uploading a file on the vulnerable DCE endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user and requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker also needs network access to the vulnerable DCE endpoint.
