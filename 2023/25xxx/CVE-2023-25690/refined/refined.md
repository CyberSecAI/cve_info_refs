Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-25690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how `mod_proxy` handles user-supplied request-target (URL) data when combined with specific `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch` configurations.
-  When a non-specific pattern in a `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch` matches a portion of the URL, and this matched portion is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target via variable substitution, it creates an opening for HTTP request smuggling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The core vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling. This occurs because the proxy server mishandles the construction of the proxied request, allowing an attacker to embed their own request within the legitimate request.
- **Insecure URL Handling:** The vulnerability arises from the inadequate handling of the URL within `mod_proxy` and `mod_rewrite`, specifically the substitution mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass of Access Controls:** Attackers can bypass access controls on the proxy server.
- **Proxying to Unintended URLs:** Attackers can force the proxy to forward requests to different, potentially malicious, origin servers than intended.
- **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can inject malicious content into the proxy's cache, potentially affecting other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted URLs to the affected Apache server.
- **Exploitation of Rewrite Rules or ProxyPassMatch:** The attack is dependent on specific server configurations using `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch` in conjunction with variable substitutions within the proxied URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be a remote user capable of sending HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of Server Configuration:** The attacker needs some awareness of the server's configuration to craft a URL that exploits the vulnerable `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch`.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, either directly or through an intermediary.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is described with an example of vulnerable configuration:

  ```
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
    ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/
  ```
- The Gentoo advisory mentions that the "worst" impact could be a denial of service but also refers to the CVE for more details. The Debian advisory explicitly mentions HTTP request smuggling and bypassing security controls.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55.
- The fix is included in version 2.4.56.
- The provided content from `httpd.apache.org` confirms the vulnerability and its impact, attributing the finding to Lars Krapf of Adobe.

In summary, CVE-2023-25690 is an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in Apache HTTPD's mod_proxy, triggered by specific configurations involving RewriteRule/ProxyPassMatch and variable substitution. This allows attackers to bypass security controls, redirect requests, and poison caches. Remote attackers with knowledge of the server's configuration can exploit it.
