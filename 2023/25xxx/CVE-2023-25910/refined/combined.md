SSA-968170: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in SIMATIC STEP
7 V5.x and Derived Products

2023-06-13
Publication Date:
2024-05-14
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.3
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

SIMATIC STEP 7 and PCS 7 contain a database management system that could allow remote users to
use embedded functions of the database (local or in a network share) that have impact on the server.

An attacker with network access to the server network could leverage these embedded functions to run
code in the database management system’s server (where STEP 7 or PCS 7 are running).

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• If multiple Engineering Systems are in use limit remote access to port 2638/tcp to trusted systems

only

• If multiple Engineering Systems are in use ensure that the user accounts in use are restricted to the

minimum required operating rights

• If only one Engineering System is in use, consider changing to “Single terminal system” mode in
the “Configure SIMATIC Workspace/Workstation” application, under the “Workstation Configuration”
tab. Restart the computer. More details can be found in the following FAQ: https://support.industry.
siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109821340/

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS 7 and other components.

SIMATIC S7-PM is an option package of SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.7 providing the possibility to use project-
wide assignment of message numbers.

SIMATIC STEP 7 V5 is the classic engineering software to configure and program SIMATIC S7-300/S7-
400/C7/WinAC controllers.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-25910

The affected product contains a database management system that could allow remote users with low
privileges to use embedded functions of the database (local or in a network share) that have impact on
the server.

An attacker with network access to the server network could leverage these embedded functions to run
code with elevated privileges in the database management system’s server.
