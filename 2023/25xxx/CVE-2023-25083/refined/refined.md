{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of sprintf with user-controlled data in the `firewall_handler_set` function. Specifically, the `ip` and `mac` JSON keys are used to fetch their respective values, which are then passed as arguments to `sprintf` to construct a command. The lack of proper bounds checking on these values can lead to a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user to send the request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user on the Milesight UR32L router to send the malicious HTTP requests."
