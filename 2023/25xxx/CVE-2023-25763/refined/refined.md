Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-25763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Email Extension Plugin bundles preconfigured templates for notification emails. The Email Template Testing feature allows users to preview these templates based on a given build. The root cause is that the plugin does not properly escape various fields included in these email templates, such as the build display name, user display name, and names of tests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. When these templates are rendered, the injected code is executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who view the crafted email templates. This could allow an attacker to steal cookies or session tokens, deface web pages, or redirect users to malicious websites, depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email templates:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the fields mentioned in the email templates through the build process which are then stored and rendered.
*   **Email Template Testing feature**: This feature allows users to preview email templates using custom build parameters, including malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over affected fields:** The attacker needs the ability to control fields such as build display name, user display name, and the names of tests. This can be achieved by contributing to a project that uses the Jenkins plugin, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow modification of these fields.
*   **Jenkins User:** An attacker would need to be a user of the Jenkins instance to exploit this.
