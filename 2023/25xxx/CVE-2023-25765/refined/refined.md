The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-25765.

**CVE-2023-25765**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Email Extension Plugin allows defining custom email templates using the Config File Provider plugin. When defined inside a folder, email templates should be subject to Script Security protection (sandboxed execution or full-script approval). In versions 2.93 and earlier, templates defined inside a folder were not subject to Script Security protection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Script Security sandbox protection for custom email templates defined within folders, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker must be able to define email templates in folders.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs the ability to create or change custom email templates within folders.

**Summary:**
The Email Extension Plugin prior to version 2.93.1 fails to apply script security protections to custom email templates defined in folders. This allows an attacker with the ability to define email templates within folders to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.
