Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ws_productreviews` module for PrestaShop, prior to version 3.6.2, contains multiple instances of improper neutralization of SQL parameters. Specifically, several SQL queries within the `ProductReviews` class (e.g., in `getByProduct()`, `getLastReviews()`, `getByValidate()`, etc.) use unsanitized input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input before including it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. Specifically, the `sort` parameter is directly used in the `ORDER BY` clause without any validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breaches:** Attackers can extract sensitive data, including personal and technical data.
*   **Account Takeover:** The attacker could gain admin access to the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could remove all data, modify data in the database, including tables, or manipulate the display to inject malicious content.
*   **Information Disclosure**: Attackers could expose sensitive tables to the front-office, potentially revealing internal logic and unlocking potential admin's AJAX scripts that are protected by tokens on the ecosystem

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Calls:**  The vulnerability can be triggered through simple HTTP requests.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The `r_sort` parameter in the URL is a key attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user accounts or privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the Attack URL:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints
*   **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker would need to understand SQL syntax to create valid SQL injections.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The advisory provides specific Proof of Concept (PoC) examples using `curl` commands.
*   It includes a code diff (patch) demonstrating how the vulnerability is fixed, involving validation of the `sort` parameter and using the `bqSQL` function before including it in SQL queries
*   It also suggests additional hardening measures such as upgrading PrestaShop, changing the database prefix, and activating OWASP rules on the WAF.
* The timeline of the vulnerability discovery, reporting and patch is included.
