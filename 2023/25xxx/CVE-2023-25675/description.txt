TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform. When running versions prior to 2.12.0 and 2.11.1 with XLA, `tf.raw_ops.Bincount` segfaults when given a parameter `weights` that is neither the same shape as parameter `arr` nor a length-0 tensor. A fix is included in TensorFlow 2.12.0 and 2.11.1.
