The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25013.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing access checks in the `InvitationController` of the "femanager" TYPO3 extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** Two instances of broken access control exist:
    *   An unauthenticated user, with a valid invitation link, can set the password of any frontend user.
    *   An unauthenticated user can delete any frontend user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can reset passwords for all frontend users, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   An attacker can delete all frontend users, causing a denial of service and potentially data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the `InvitationController` of the "femanager" extension.
*   The attacker must have a valid invitation link (for password reset)
*  The attacker needs to send a malicious request to delete frontend users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but needs to have access to an invitation link if exploiting the password reset vulnerability.
*   The invitation component of the extension must be configured and used on the website.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 5.5.2 and below, 6.0.0 - 6.3.3, and 7.0.0 - 7.0.1 of the "femanager" extension.
*   Updated versions (5.5.3, 6.3.4, and 7.1.0) are available to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a severity of "High".
*   The provided CVSS score is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
