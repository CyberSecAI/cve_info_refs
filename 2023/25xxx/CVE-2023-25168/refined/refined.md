{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of symlinks during file deletion. The application doesn't properly validate symlinks, allowing an attacker to manipulate them to point to locations outside the intended data directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files and directories on the host system where the application is running. This includes potentially deleting critical system files leading to system instability or data loss. This vulnerability can be combined with another vulnerability (`GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5`) to overwrite files on the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they have an existing 'server' allocated and controlled by the application.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an existing 'server' allocated and controlled by the vulnerable application. This gives them the ability to manipulate the filesystem within their allocated server space."
