# Improper Link Resolution allowing the deletion of files and directories on the host system

Critical

[matthewpi](/matthewpi)
published
GHSA-66p8-j459-rq63
Feb 8, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/pterodactyl/wings
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.7.3, 1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2, 1.11.3

## Patched versions

1.7.4, 1.11.4

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can be used to delete files and directories recursively on the host system. This vulnerability can be combined with [`GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5) to overwrite files on the host system.

In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by Wings. Information on how the exploitation of this vulnerability works will be released on February 24th, 2023 in North America.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.4` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.4`.

Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.4` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.4`.

### Workarounds

None at this time.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Affected versions

< 1.7.2, 1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2

## Patched versions

1.7.3, 1.11.3

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can be used to create new files and on the host system that previously did not exist, potentially allowing attackers to change their resource allocations, promote their containers to privileged mode, or potentially add ssh authorized keys to allow the attacker access to a remote shell on the target machine.

In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by Wings. Information on how the exploitation of this vulnerability works will be released on February 24th, 2023 in North America.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.3` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.3`.

Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.3` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.3`.
