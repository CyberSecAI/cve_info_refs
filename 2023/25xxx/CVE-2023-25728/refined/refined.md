Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-25728:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports, specifically when a child iframe triggers a redirect. The `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header, designed to report violations without blocking content, could be exploited to leak sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSP Report Leak:** When a cross-origin iframe redirects, Firefox incorrectly includes the full, unredacted URI of the pre-redirect request in the violation report, instead of just the origin. This violates the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).
*   **Inconsistent Reporting:** Firefox was not consistently redacting full paths to the origin, when a cross-origin resource is blocked by a CSP rule in the 'blocked-uri' part of the report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information embedded in URLs, such as OAuth codes, user form data, session identifiers, or any other information present in the URL.
*   **Cross-Site Leakage:** A malicious page can leak data from a cross-origin embedded page, even if the main page has no direct access to the embedded page's content or DOM.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Page Setup:** The attacker creates a web page with a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header that restricts frame sources and specifies a report-uri under their control.
2.  **Embedding a Victim Page:** The attacker's page embeds a victim page in an iframe.
3.  **Triggering a Redirect:** When a user interacts with the embedded page, navigating it to a URL that results in a redirect within the iframe, Firefox sends a CSP violation report to the attacker's server, which will contain the unredacted URI before the redirect.
4.  **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker's server receives the CSP violation report containing the leaked information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker needs to host a web page with a crafted CSP header, the target page should be frameable, and should contain a redirect that leaks information in the URI.
*   **Report URI Control:** The attacker needs to specify a report-uri under their control to receive the leaked data.
*   **No user interaction**: The user has to interact with the framed page, but not with the attacking page directly.
