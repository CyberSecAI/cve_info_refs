Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25115:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `set_openvpn_client` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, it's caused by the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data, specifically the `remote_ip` and `port` parameters within a crafted JSON request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function writes data to a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) on the stack without proper bounds checking.
*   **Unsafe String Formatting:** The `sprintf` function uses user-provided data without proper sanitization, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input strings are too large.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack, potentially including the return address. This allows them to redirect the execution flow to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint of the router. The request must include a specific JSON structure with a large `remote_ip` value and the `port` value.
*   **Specific Core and Function:** The request must target the `yruo_vpn_openvpn_client` "core" and the "set" function to reach the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to send the necessary HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is within the `set_openvpn_client` function
*   The vulnerable code snippet:
    ```c
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"ip remote server %s port %d",remote_ip,port);
    ```
*   The `remote_ip` string, taken from the JSON request, is used as an argument to the `sprintf`, without prior length check.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**
The provided JSON payload demonstrates how to trigger the overflow:
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "remote_ip": "A"*0x600,
                "port": 1,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
This payload sends a large string of "A"s as the `remote_ip`, causing `sprintf` to write past the end of the `vtysh_command_buffer`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report notes that multiple other similar vulnerabilities exist within the same binary using the same vulnerable `sprintf` pattern, as listed in the CVEs section.
*   The vendor did not release a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.

This vulnerability allows a high-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Milesight UR32L router by sending a crafted HTTP request, making it a critical issue.
