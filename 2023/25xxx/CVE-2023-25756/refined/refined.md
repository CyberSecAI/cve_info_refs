Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-25756:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the BIOS firmware of certain Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability stems from a flaw that allows reading memory outside the intended boundaries within the BIOS firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on the system.
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information**: The out-of-bounds read could potentially expose sensitive information stored in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Access:** The attacker needs to have adjacent access to the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the target system (adjacent access).
- The attacker needs to have already authenticated to the system.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
