- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `getUiFile` method within `ResourceController.java`. Specifically, the `fileName` parameter is checked for the presence of "/", but the `reportId` parameter is not, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path using directory traversal sequences in the `reportId` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of the `reportId` parameter, which is concatenated into the file path, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `GET /resource/ui/get` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with crafted `fileName` and `reportId` parameters. No specific authentication requirements are mentioned in the provided description.
