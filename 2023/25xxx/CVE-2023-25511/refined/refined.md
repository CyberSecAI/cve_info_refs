- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A division-by-zero error in `cuobjdump`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Division by zero vulnerability (CWE-369).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit may lead to a limited denial of service by causing a crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user runs the `cuobjdump` tool on a crafted, malformed input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into running `cuobjdump` on a malformed input file, meaning a user interaction is required (UI:R). The attacker requires local access (AV:L), no special privileges needed (PR:N) .
