### Details

This section summarizes the potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors follow [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Base Score** | **Vector and CWE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2023‑25512 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in `cuobjdump`, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds memory read by running `cuobjdump` on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | 5.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L&version=3.1) [CWE‑125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) |
| CVE‑2023‑25513 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in `cuobjdump`, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking a user into running `cuobjdump` on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | 5.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) [CWE‑125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) |
| CVE‑2023‑25514 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in `cuobjdump`, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking a user into running `cuobjdump` on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | 5.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) [CWE‑125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) |
| CVE‑2023‑25510 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit SDK for Linux and Windows contains a NULL pointer dereference in `cuobjdump`, where a local user running the tool against a malformed binary may cause a limited denial of service. | 3.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) [CWE‑476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html) |
| CVE‑2023‑25511 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in `cuobjdump`, where a division-by-zero error may enable a user to cause a crash, which may lead to a limited denial of service. | 3.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) [CWE‑369](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/369.html) |
