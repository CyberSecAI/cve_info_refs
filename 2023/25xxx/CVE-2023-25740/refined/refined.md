  "cve": "CVE-2023-25740",
  "description": "After downloading a Windows `.scf` script from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system. This also had the potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles `.scf` files downloaded from the local file system on Windows. Specifically, the `IconFile` parameter within the `.scf` file is not properly sanitized, allowing for the inclusion of remote paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized input: The browser does not validate the `IconFile` parameter within `.scf` files, allowing an attacker to inject a remote path.",
      "NTLM credential leak: When a remote path is specified in the `IconFile` parameter, the operating system attempts to connect to that path, potentially leaking NTLM credentials."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential leakage of NTLM credentials. By tricking a user into opening a malicious .scf file, an attacker can force the user's system to attempt a connection to a remote server under the attacker's control, which may result in the user's NTLM credentials being sent to the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves tricking a user into downloading and opening a malicious `.scf` file from their local file system. The attacker controls the contents of this `.scf` file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious `.scf` file and trick the user into downloading and opening it.",
      "The attacker requires a server to listen for the incoming connection and capture the leaked NTLM credentials."
    ],
     "affected_platforms": [
        "This vulnerability specifically affects Firefox running on Windows."
      ]
