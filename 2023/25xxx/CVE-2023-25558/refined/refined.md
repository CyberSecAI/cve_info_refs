Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the `datahub-frontend` component when Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from an untrusted source, potentially leading to the instantiation of malicious objects.
- **Bypass of `RestrictedObjectInputStream`:** Although the application uses a `RestrictedObjectInputStream`, it still allows a wide range of Java packages to be deserialized which makes it exploitable through different gadget chains. This implies the restrictions were not sufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In the worst-case scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **SSO Configuration:** The application needs to be configured to use SSO for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges is able to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of `datahub-frontend` prior to v0.9.5.
- The fix involves updating the `pac4j` dependency to version 4.x or later.
- The GitHub Security Advisory also includes a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, with the vector string as `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.
