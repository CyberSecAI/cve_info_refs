{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of file extension validation in the file upload functionality. Specifically, the system does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded through the `/common/api/file/upload` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including potentially executable files. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the server, unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `/common/api/file/upload` endpoint. An attacker can craft a malicious file, such as a webshell, and upload it to the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned, so it is implied that any user might be able to exploit this."
