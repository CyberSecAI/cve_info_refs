Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a "broken access control" issue, meaning there is a missing check for authorization, authentication, or nonce tokens. This lack of proper validation allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the absence of proper access control mechanisms in the plugin, which leads to unauthorized access to privileged functions or actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "Subscriber") can execute actions that should be reserved for higher privileged users.
- The specific impact varies depending on the nature of the privileged action that can be exploited. The content states that this is a general description and "specific impact varies case by case".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the Easy Table of Contents plugin.
- It appears the attacker needs to be a subscriber to the WordPress site.
- The specific method of exploitation is not explained in the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a subscriber (a low-privileged user) on the WordPress website running the vulnerable plugin.
- No special skills or elevated privileges are explicitly mentioned in the content
