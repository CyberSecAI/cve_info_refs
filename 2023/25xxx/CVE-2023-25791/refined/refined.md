- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The plugin does not properly restrict access to certain functionalities, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber role) can perform actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact can vary case by case, but it could lead to unauthorized changes to the website's settings, content, or functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function lacking proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber to exploit the vulnerability.
