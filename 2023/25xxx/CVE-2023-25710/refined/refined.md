The WordPress "Click to Call or Chat Buttons" plugin, versions 1.4.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, including but not limited to, phishing attacks, malware distribution, or defacement of the website.
