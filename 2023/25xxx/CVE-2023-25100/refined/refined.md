The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-25100, affecting the Milesight UR32L router.

**CVE-2023-25100 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `vtysh_ubus` binary due to the unsafe use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Specifically, the `default_class` parameter in the `set_qos` function is used in an `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with high privileges can send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges to send the crafted HTTP requests to the `/cgi` endpoint of the router.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet within the `set_qos` function:

```c
is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"rule_list");
if (((is_equal != 0) &&
        (is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"class_list"), is_equal != 0)) &&
     (is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"default_class"), is_equal == 0)) {
    default_class = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
}
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"default-class %s",default_class);

```

The `default_class` parameter, extracted from the JSON request, is directly used in the `sprintf` function without checking its length. If the length of `default_class` exceeds the size of `vtysh_command_buffer`, it will cause a buffer overflow.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**

The provided JSON payload demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_qos_download",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_qos_upload",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "default_class":"A"*0x300
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In this example, the `default_class` is set to a string of 768 'A' characters which will overflow the buffer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5.
*   The Talos report lists multiple other CVEs affecting the same binary with similar `sprintf` buffer overflow issues.
*   The vendor did not release a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.
