# rootless: `/sys/fs/cgroup` is writable when cgroupns isn't unshared

Low

[cyphar](/cyphar)
published
GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc
Mar 29, 2023

## Package

runc

## Affected versions

< 1.1.5

## Patched versions

1.1.5

## Description

### Impact

It was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons:

1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl)
2. or, when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare)

A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host .

Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected.

### Patches

v1.1.5 (planned)

### Workarounds

* Condition 1: Unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts.
* Condition 2 (very rare): add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L
