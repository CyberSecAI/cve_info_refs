Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the `level` parameter is handled in the `/api/admin/user/list` endpoint. The application directly inserts the value of the `level` parameter into the SQL query without any sanitization or proper handling using `${}` in `UserMapper.xml`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. The `level` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it possible to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even complete database compromise. The provided example demonstrates how to extract the database user information, confirming the ability to execute SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `level` parameter of the GET request to the `/api/admin/user/list` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send the crafted HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable API endpoint (`/api/admin/user/list`) and the parameter name (`level`).
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious SQL payload.
- **Access to Admin Panel** Access to the admin panel of the application is needed to send the request through the UI.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `crmeb_java` versions <= 1.3.4.
- The affected component is the `/api/admin/user/list` endpoint.
- The vulnerable code is in `\crmeb\crmeb-service\src\main\resources\mapper\user\UserMapper.xml` on line 36.
- The attacker uses `extractvalue` to confirm the injection, and the provided example shows how to retrieve the current user's database name.
- The attack vector is remote.
