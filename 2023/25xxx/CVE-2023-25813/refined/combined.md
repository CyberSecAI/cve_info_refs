# SQL Injection via replacements

Critical

[ephys](/ephys)
published
GHSA-wrh9-cjv3-2hpw
Feb 22, 2023

## Package

npm

sequelize
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 6.19.1

## Patched versions

6.19.1

## Description

### Impact

The SQL injection exploit is related to replacements. Here is such an example:

In the following query, some parameters are passed through replacements, and some are passed directly through the `where` option.

```
User.findAll({
  where: or(
    literal('soundex("firstName") = soundex(:firstName)'),
    { lastName: lastName },
  ),
  replacements: { firstName },
})
```

This is a very legitimate use case, but this query was vulnerable to SQL injection due to how Sequelize processed the query: Sequelize built a first query using the `where` option, then passed it over to `sequelize.query` which parsed the resulting SQL to inject all `:replacements`.

If the user passed values such as

```
{
  "firstName": "OR true; DROP TABLE users;",
  "lastName": ":firstName"
}
```

Sequelize would first generate this query:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex("firstName") = soundex(:firstName) OR "lastName" = ':firstName'
```

Then would inject replacements in it, which resulted in this:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex("firstName") = soundex('OR true; DROP TABLE users;') OR "lastName" = ''OR true; DROP TABLE users;''
```

As you can see this resulted in arbitrary user-provided SQL being executed.

### Patches

The issue was fixed in Sequelize 6.19.2

### Workarounds

Do not use the `replacements` and the `where` option in the same query if you are not using Sequelize >= 6.19.2.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hi everyone 👋

We have recently released Sequelize 6.19.1 (since patched as 6.19.2) which includes a [breaking change](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/14472).

We normally want to fully respect semver rules, unfortunately a very serious [SQL injection exploit](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/13817) has surfaced and it was impossible for us to fix it without introducing a breaking change. We considered the issue serious enough to break the rule and release the fix in V6. Most of you are going to be completely unaffected, but a small percentage of users may experience breakage with this version, more below

## The exploit

The SQL injection exploit is related to replacements. Here is such an example:

In the following query, some parameters are passed through replacements, and some are passed directly through the `where` option.

```
User.findAll({
  where: or(
    literal('soundex("firstName") = soundex(:firstName)'),
    { lastName: lastName },
  ),
  replacements: { firstName },
})
```

This is a very legitimate use case, but this query was vulnerable to SQL injection due to how Sequelize processed the query: Sequelize built a first query using the `where` option, then passed it over to `sequelize.query` which parsed the resulting SQL to inject all `:replacements`.

If the user passed values such as

```
{
  "firstName": "OR true; DROP TABLE users;",
  "lastName": ":firstName"
}
```

Sequelize would first generate this query:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex("firstName") = soundex(:firstName) OR "lastName" = ':firstName'
```

Then would inject replacements in it, which resulted in this:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex("firstName") = soundex('OR true; DROP TABLE users;') OR "lastName" = ''OR true; DROP TABLE users;''
```

As you can see this resulted in arbitrary user-provided SQL being executed.

## The solution & breaking change

The way to fix this without breaking everyone's codebase was to use a smarter SQL parser that would only inject replacements in places where native SQL parameters are allowed (with some safe exceptions to stay as backward compatible as possible).

This means that `:replacements` will not be treated as such anymore if they are quoted, as we treat it as being part of a SQL string.

Details here: <https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/v6/test/unit/utils/sql.test.js>

On top of this, in Sequelize 7, we rewrote this system completely to handle both steps at the same time. Removing all risk of SQL injection ([#14447](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/14447)).

Some of you relied on this to inject parameters inside of sql strings, which is why this can be considered a breaking change.

Note however that doing that was not safer than simply concatenating, and it being done by us may have given you a false sense of security regarding input sanitization.

---

Once again, we are very sorry for the inconvenience this causes.
