**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Use-After-Free (UAF): The vulnerability arises from accessing a memory location that has been previously freed, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the UAF vulnerability can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation can lead to memory corruption and application crashes, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Crafted Web Content: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content. This indicates the attacker can deliver the exploit via a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
