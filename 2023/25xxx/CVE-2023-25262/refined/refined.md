**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Stimulsoft Reporting Designer (Web) allows embedding sources from external locations. When a user specifies an external resource, the server, rather than the client, makes the request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The server makes outbound requests to external resources based on user input, without proper validation, which can lead to SSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary external locations, potentially importing data from attacker-controlled resources.
- The attacker may also leverage this to exfiltrate data from machines on the internal network of the server hosting the Stimulsoft Reporting Designer (Web).

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker needs to specify a malicious URL in the external resource input of the Stimulsoft Reporting Designer (Web).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No privileges are required if the reporting viewer or designer is embedded in a page without authentication. The attacker only needs network access to the server hosting the designer. The authentication and authorization implementation is up to the person who embeds the viewer/designer.
