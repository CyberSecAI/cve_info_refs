# XSS Vulnerability in Software Catalog

Moderate

[Rugvip](/Rugvip)
published
GHSA-7hv8-3fr9-j2hv
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

npm

@backstage/catalog-model
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.5

## Patched versions

1.2.0

npm

@backstage/core-components
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

< 0.12.3

npm

@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

< 1.7.1

1.7.2

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor with access to add or modify content in an instance of the Backstage software catalog to inject script URLs in the entities stored in the catalog. If users of the catalog then click on said URLs, that can lead to an XSS attack.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in both the frontend and backend implementations. The default `Link` component from `@backstage/core-components` will now reject `javascript:` URLs, and there is a global override of `window.open` to do the same.

In addition the catalog model as well as the catalog backend now has additional validation built in that prevents `javascript:` URLs in known annotations.

### Workarounds

The general practice of limiting access to modifying catalog content and requiring code reviews greatly helps mitigate this vulnerability.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
