# Privilege escalation allowing DELETE on resources on object locked buckets under Governance mode

High

[harshavardhana](/harshavardhana)
published
GHSA-c8fc-mjj8-fc63
Feb 21, 2023

## Package

gomod

minio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= RELEASE.2020-04-10T03-34-42Z

## Patched versions

RELEASE.2023-02-17T17-52-43Z

## Description

### Impact

This issue impacts all users that fall under the following category. All buckets with object

locking under governance mode. Now on those buckets if you specifically added a `Deny`

statement on s3:ByPassGoverance. It shall not be honored correctly if you have an `Allow`

statement with all S3 actions `s3:*`.

For example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      { "Effect": "Deny", "Action": ["s3:BypassGovernanceRetention"], "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"] },
      { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:*"], "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"] }
    ]
}
```

Ideally, we should return "Access Denied" to all users attempting to DELETE a versioned object

accompanied by a header `X-Amz-Bypass-Governance-Retention: true` to request a bypass

on the governance mode. In this scenario, the caller would succeed in deleting the content.

All users are advised to upgrade to [RELEASE.2023-02-17T17-52-43Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2023-02-17T17-52-43Z) to get the relevant fix and protection.

Additionally please review all your IAM policies for any such occurrences.

## Description

This policy allows bypassing governance for deletion,

though s3:BypassGovernanceRetention is explicitly denied.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      { "Effect": "Deny", "Action": ["s3:BypassGovernanceRetention"],
"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"] },
      { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:*"], "Resource":
["arn:aws:s3:::*"] }
    ]
}

```

Fix the related code and avoid allowing s3:GetBucketObjectLockConfigurationAction

to remove an object locked with governance.

Found by [@wdinyes](https://github.com/wdinyes)

## Motivation and Context

Disallow removal of governance protected with the policy above

## How to test this PR?

1. Create a bucket with lock enabled with default governance locking
2. Create a regular user associated to the policy above
3. Upload a version and try to remove it

Can you try Deny GetObjectLockConfiguration and test the same policy?
