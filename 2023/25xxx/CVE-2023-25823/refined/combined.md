# Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling

Moderate

[abidlabs](/abidlabs)
published
GHSA-3x5j-9vwr-8rr5
Feb 23, 2023

## Package

pip

gradio
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.13.1

## Patched versions

3.13.1

## Description

### Impact

This is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides.

### Patches

The problem has been patched. Ideally, users should upgrade to `gradio==3.19.1` or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
