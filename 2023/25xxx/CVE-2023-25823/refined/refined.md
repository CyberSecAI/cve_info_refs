- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Older versions of Gradio sent a private SSH key to any user connecting to a shared Gradio app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of private SSH key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could access other users' shared Gradio demos and potentially other exploits depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker can connect to the shared Gradio application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to connect to the shared Gradio application.
