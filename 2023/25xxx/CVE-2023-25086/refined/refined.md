Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-25086:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `vtysh_ubus` binary of the Milesight UR32L router, specifically within the `firewall_handler_set` function. This function uses `sprintf` with user-controlled data from the `dport` JSON key, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The `sprintf` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) without proper bounds checking. When the input string provided via the `dport` JSON key exceeds the buffer size, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, diverting execution flow to malicious code of their choosing. This can lead to complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint of the router. This request must contain specific JSON data in its body to reach the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **High Privileges:** The attacker must be a high-privileged user to send the necessary HTTP requests. This likely means the attacker needs to have valid credentials for the router's administrative interface.

**Technical Details:**

-   The vulnerable code path is within the `firewall_handler_set` function in the `vtysh_ubus` binary.
-   The JSON data includes a `"core": "yruo_firewall_mac_binding"` and a `"function": "set"`, along with a `"base": "yruo_firewall_port_mapping"` and the vulnerable `"dport"` key with a large string.
-   The `sprintf` call is constructing a command string for another service, using the provided `dport` value.
-   The `exec_no_return_debug` function is called after the `sprintf`, likely executing the command which can also trigger the crash if overflow is reached

**Exploit Example:**
The provided JSON exploit code for this CVE is:

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_firewall_mac_binding",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_firewall_port_mapping",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "dport": "A"*0x300,
                "index": 1,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This JSON payload sets the dport field to a string of 0x300 'A' characters, causing the buffer overflow when the sprintf function is called
