```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OGC Filter expression language and OGC Common Query Language (CQL) used in GeoServer's WFS, WMS, and WCS protocols are vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection in `PropertyIsLike` filter when used with a String field and any database DataStore, or with a PostGIS DataStore with encode functions enabled.",
    "SQL Injection in `strEndsWith` function when used with a PostGIS DataStore with encode functions enabled.",
    "SQL Injection in `strStartsWith` function when used with a PostGIS DataStore with encode functions enabled.",
    "SQL Injection in `FeatureId` filter when used with any database table having a String primary key column and when prepared statements are disabled.",
    "SQL Injection in `jsonArrayContains` function when used with a String or JSON field and with a PostGIS or Oracle DataStore (GeoServer 2.22.0+ only).",
    "SQL Injection in `DWithin` filter when used with an Oracle DataStore."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data within the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious OGC Filter or CQL expressions through the WFS, WMS, and WCS protocols.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with malicious OGC Filter or CQL expressions to the vulnerable GeoServer instance."
