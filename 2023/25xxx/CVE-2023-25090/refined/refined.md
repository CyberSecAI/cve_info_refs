{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data, leading to a buffer overflow in the `vtysh_command_buffer`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with high privileges can send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint, triggering the vulnerable `sprintf` calls within the `vtysh_ubus` binary.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs high privileges to send the malicious HTTP requests."

The provided content describes CVE-2023-25090 as one of many buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Milesight UR32L router. Specifically, this CVE is located in the `handle_interface_acl` function, where the `interface` and `in_acl` parameters from a JSON request are used in a `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow when a sufficiently long `interface` value is provided. The report also provides a proof-of-concept JSON payload to trigger the vulnerability.
