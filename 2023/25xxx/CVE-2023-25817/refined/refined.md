Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of permissions when creating public shares in Nextcloud. Specifically, when a user creates a public share with view or download permissions, the system incorrectly allows them to escalate their permissions to delete files they should not have access to delete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Permission Handling:** The core issue is that the system is not correctly saving the intended permissions for public shares.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users with limited permissions (view/download only) on public shares can gain unintended delete privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** A user with limited permissions on a public share can delete files within that share, leading to potential data loss.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Users can perform actions (deleting files) that they are explicitly not intended to be able to do.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Public Share Creation:** An attacker needs to be able to create a public share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges, specifically the ability to create a public share.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction. Although, it is not entirely clear based on the current data exactly what user interaction is required for exploitation.
- **Access to Public Share:** The attacker needs access to the created public share, even with limited view or download permissions.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:**  Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 24.0.0 and later (before 24.0.9).
- **Patched Versions:** Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server version 24.0.9 addresses the vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 score of 3.5/10 is given, indicating low severity. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`,
- **CWE:**  The identified weakness is CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions.
