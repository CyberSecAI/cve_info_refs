# NPE in TensorArrayConcatV2

Moderate

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-64jg-wjww-7c5w
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.11.1, 2.12.0

## Description

### Impact

When ctx->step\_containter() is a null ptr, the Lookup function will be executed with a null pointer.

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.TensorArrayConcatV2(handle=['a', 'b'], flow_in = 0.1, dtype=tf.int32, element_shape_except0=1)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [239139d2ae6a81ae9ba499ad78b56d9b2931538a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/239139d2ae6a81ae9ba499ad78b56d9b2931538a).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
