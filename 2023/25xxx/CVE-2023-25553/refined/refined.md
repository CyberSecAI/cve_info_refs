- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the logging capabilities of the webserver. This vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the webserver logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser, potentially allowing for data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by tampering with parameters on a DCE endpoint through the logging capabilities of the webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) and requires user interaction (UI:R). They also need network access (AV:N) and low attack complexity (AC:L)
