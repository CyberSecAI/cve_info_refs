- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an improper authentication mechanism where the device can be compromised when a BCU key of less than seven digits is used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-287: Improper Authentication. The vulnerability lies in the inadequate length of the BCU key, specifically less than 7 digits, which can be exploited.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could result in a compromised product, potentially allowing unauthorized control and manipulation of the affected KNX devices. The CVSS v3.1 score indicates a high severity with potential for loss of Confidentiality (Low), Integrity (High), and Availability (High).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the KNX installation and needs to be able to send commands to the device. The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
