- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly validate the instance link of the sender when displaying a user or note received through ActivityPub, allowing the injection of URLs with the `javascript` scheme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user clicks the crafted link.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a malicious ActivityPub message containing a crafted `javascript:` URL in the instance link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send ActivityPub messages to a vulnerable Misskey instance.
