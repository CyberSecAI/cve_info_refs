```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Directory traversal vulnerability",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application allows access to server-side files due to insufficient input sanitization or validation when handling file paths.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary server-side files, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, logs, and system details. Examples include: /proc/sched_debug, /etc/httpd/logs/error_log, /var/log/httpd/error_log, /proc/net/tcp, /proc/interrupts, /proc/net/arp, /proc/cpuinfo, and /var/log/secure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating file paths to access files outside of the intended directory. This is likely done through an exposed interface that accepts user-provided file paths.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is interpreted as a file path by the vulnerable application."
