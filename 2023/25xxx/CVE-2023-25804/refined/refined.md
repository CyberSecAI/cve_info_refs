- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application saves an SSH key to a file location specified by the user-provided `name` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can write an SSH key to an arbitrary file location on the server, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access. In this case it allowed to write to the /tmp folder.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted `name` parameter containing path traversal sequences like `../` when saving an SSH key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the `name` parameter when saving the SSH key.
