Roxy-WI is a Web interface for managing Haproxy, Nginx, Apache, and Keepalived servers. Versions prior to 6.3.5.0 have a limited path traversal vulnerability. An SSH key can be saved into an unintended location, for example the `/tmp` folder using a payload `../../../../../tmp/test111_dev`. This issue has been fixed in version 6.3.5.0.
