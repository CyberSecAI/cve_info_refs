| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c0)  Vincent Lefèvre    2023-02-02 01:16:18 UTC  ``` Consider the following C program:  #include <stdio.h> #include <locale.h>  int main (void) {   if (setlocale (LC_ALL, ""))     {       printf ("1234567890123:\n");       printf ("%0+ -'13ld:\n", 1234567L);     }   return 0; }  and try it with a locale that has a thousands separator, such as "LC_ALL=en_US.utf8".  With glibc up to 2.36, I get as expected:  1234567890123: +1,234,567   :  But I got a report from Klaus Dittrich (following his bug reports against GNU MPFR at <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/mpfr/2023-01/msg00001.html> and <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/mpfr/2023-01/msg00017.html>) that with glibc git on 2023-01-17, one gets:  1234567890123: +1,234,567     :  i.e. padding is done to width 15 instead of 13.  I've got another report that the MPFR test also fails with glibc 2.37, which is probably the above issue. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c1)  Vincent Lefèvre    2023-02-02 01:17:31 UTC  ``` BTW, see also [bug 23432](show_bug.cgi?id=23432 "UNCONFIRMED - incorrect printf output for integers with thousands separator and precision field larger than the number of digits (needing leading zeros)") for other issues related to the thousands separator (but no regression like here). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c2)  Vincent Lefèvre    2023-02-02 02:25:34 UTC  ``` I suppose that the same bug occurs with sprintf(), in which case it can yield a buffer overflow since additional characters are output. So I'm raising the importance. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c3)  Frederik Schwan    2023-02-02 07:51:30 UTC  ``` I can confirm that mpfr (latest release + master) sprintf tests fail with glibc 2.37. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c4)  Vincent Lefèvre    2023-02-02 08:54:28 UTC  ``` I suspect that the padding amount is computed ignoring the thousands separators, so that the increasing of the width would be equal to the total length of the thousands separator. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c5)  Xi Ruoyao    2023-02-02 12:40:28 UTC  ``` The patch for #23432 (<https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2023-January/144847.html>) fixes the testcase. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c6)  Carlos O'Donell    2023-02-02 14:27:15 UTC  ``` Thanks for reporting this. Yes, this is a regression where after the refactor the implementation does not account for grouping characters during padding of the width.  We'll work to get this fixed on the release branch so the distributions can pickup the fix directly.  I'm marking this security plus since the width could be unexpected if you used a number of other APIs to pre-compute an expected with e.g. nl_langinfo, and digit counting.  I've asked Andreas if he's working on a v2, because the test case needs a dependency on the test locale generation: <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2023-February/145204.html> ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c7)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2023-02-02 22:17:50 UTC  ``` Confirmed that this could potentially cause a buffer overflow with sprintf, something like below.  This will occur in the corner case where an application computes the size of buffer to be exactly enough to fit the digits in question, but sprintf ends up writing a couple of extra bytes, hence going beyond bounds.  #include <stdio.h> #include <locale.h> #include <string.h>  int main (void) {   char buf[strlen ("1234567890123:") + 1];   __builtin_memset (buf, 'x', sizeof (buf));   if (setlocale (LC_ALL, ""))     {       printf ("1234567890123:\n");       printf ("%0+ -'13ld:\n", 1234567L);       sprintf (buf, "%0+ -'13ld:", 1234567L);       for (size_t i = 0; i < strlen ("1234567890123:") + 1; i++) 	{ 	  printf ("%c", buf[i]); 	}       printf ("\n");     }   return 0; } ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c8)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2023-02-02 22:19:15 UTC  ``` Oops, hit send too soon.  To finish, building with _FORTIFY_SOURCE should catch this problem immediately:  e.g., build the above program with:  $ gcc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1 -O -o sprintf-test sprintf-test.c  and run:  $ LOCPATH=$PWD/localedata LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ./elf/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path .:./math:./elf:./dlfcn:./nss:./nis:./rt:./resolv:./mathvec:./support:./crypt:./nptl ../sprintf-test 1234567890123: +1,234,567     : *** buffer overflow detected ***: terminated Aborted (core dumped) ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c9)  Carlos O'Donell    2023-02-06 15:24:34 UTC  ``` This is now fixed in master for glibc 2.38.  I'm working to add a NEWS entry and then backport to release/2.37/master. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c10)  Carlos O'Donell    2023-02-06 18:03:45 UTC  ``` Fixed by c980549cc6a1c03c23cc2fe3e7b0fe626a0364b0 for glibc 2.38. Marking as required for 2.37. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=30068#c11)  Carlos O'Donell    2023-02-08 01:32:28 UTC  ``` Fixed in release/2.37/master with:  commit 07b9521fc6369d000216b96562ff7c0ed32a16c4 Author: Carlos O'Donell <carlos@redhat.com> Date:   Thu Jan 19 12:50:20 2023 +0100      Account for grouping in printf width ([bug 30068](show_bug.cgi?id=30068 "RESOLVED FIXED - incorrect printf output for integers with thousands separator and width field (CVE-2023-25139)"))          This is a partial fix for mishandling of grouping when formatting     integers.

This is a partial fix for mishandling of grouping when formatting
integers.  It properly computes the width in presence of grouping
characteres when the precision is larger than the number of significant
digits.

Subject: CVE-2023-25139: glibc-2.37 sprintf buffer overflow

Hi,

I just came across this and don't think I've seen a
note of it to this list:

CVE-2023-25139: a buffer overflow in sprintf(3) in
glibc-2.37:

<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30068>

glibc-2.37 was released on 2023-02-01, so this isn't
going to be wide spread.

Fixed in
<https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=c980549cc6a1c03c23cc2fe3e7b0fe626a0364b0>
