- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Milesight UR32L router's `vtysh_ubus` binary uses `sprintf` with user-controlled data, leading to buffer overflows. The `vtysh_ubus` binary parses JSON data from HTTP requests, and uses values extracted from the JSON to construct commands that are then executed. The `sprintf` function is used to format these commands, but the size of the destination buffer is not checked against the size of the input data extracted from the JSON, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the usage of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking. The `sprintf` function is used to compose commands, and parameters for these commands are extracted from user-controlled JSON data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker who can send HTTP requests can cause a buffer overflow and overwrite the stack, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint of the Milesight UR32L router. These requests include JSON data with overly long values, which overwrite the stack when processed by `sprintf`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to send the HTTP requests that trigger the vulnerabilities.

The provided content provides detailed information regarding the vulnerable parameters, vulnerable code locations, and proof of concept exploits. It includes more detail than a typical CVE description.
Specifically for CVE-2023-25108, it details that the `remote_ip` parameter within the `yruo_vpn_gre` core is used to construct the command string which can cause a buffer overflow:
```
is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"remote_ip");
if (is_equal == 0) {
	vtysh_command_argument = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
	vtysh_command_format = "tunnel destination %s";
    [...]
}
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,vtysh_command_format,vtysh_command_argument);
```
