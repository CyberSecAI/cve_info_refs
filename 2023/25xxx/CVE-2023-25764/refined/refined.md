Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-25764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Email Extension Plugin allows users to define custom email templates using the Config File Provider plugin as Jelly or Groovy files.
*   The plugin's Email Template Testing feature allows previewing these templates by specifying a `managed:` name prefix.
*   The root cause is that the Email Extension Plugin versions 2.93 and earlier **do not escape, sanitize, or sandbox** the rendered email template output or the log output generated during template rendering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the lack of proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts into custom email templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when viewing the email template preview. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Access to sensitive information accessible within the browser's context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating or modifying custom email templates with malicious JavaScript code.
*   The malicious code is then triggered when a user previews the custom template using the Email Template Testing feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify custom email templates within the Jenkins instance. This generally requires having appropriate permissions within Jenkins to manage configurations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Email Extension Plugin version 2.93 and earlier.
*   The fix involves rendering email template previews inside a sandboxed iframe in version 2.93.1 of the plugin.
