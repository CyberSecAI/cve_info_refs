The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25104.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data in the `set_ike_profile` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary. Specifically, the `username` and `password` parameters from a JSON request are directly used in a `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `vtysh_command_buffer`.
- Unsafe usage of `sprintf` with attacker-controlled data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution.
- The attacker can potentially take complete control of the device.
- Device crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted JSON with a specific "core" and "function" values, and also needs to be a high-privileged user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs high privileges on the Milesight UR32L device to send HTTP requests to the `/cgi` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted JSON with a specific "core" and "function" values that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the required JSON structure and vulnerable keys.
