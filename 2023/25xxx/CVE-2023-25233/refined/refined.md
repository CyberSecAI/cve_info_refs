Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromRouteStatic` function within the Tenda AC500 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of length checks when copying user-provided parameters `entrys` and `mitInterface` into local variables `v8` and `v7` respectively.
- These variables are then used in a `sprintf` function which copies data without bounds checking into a stack-based buffer `s`.
-  The lack of bounds checking in `sprintf` when copying from v8 and v7 allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the stack-based buffer `s`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a crash or instability by overflowing the buffer leading to denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With a carefully crafted overflow payload, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/RouteStatic` page of the Tenda AC500 web interface.
- The attacker needs to supply the `entrys` and `mitInterface` parameters in the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker needs to know the IP address of the Tenda AC500 router.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `fromRouteStatic`.
- The vulnerable parameters are `entrys` and `mitInterface`.
- The vulnerable function uses `sprintf` to copy the parameters.
- The buffer `s` is stack-based
- The PoC provided shows that sending 0x200 bytes of 's' for `entrys` and 0x200 bytes of 'a' for `mitInterface` is enough to trigger the overflow.
- The affected product is Tenda AC500 and the version is up to AC500_V2.0.1.9(1307).
