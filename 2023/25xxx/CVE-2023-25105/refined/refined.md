The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes information for CVE-2023-25105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data in the `set_ike_profile` function, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the usage of `sprintf` with the user-controlled `secrets_remote` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint with a large value for the `secrets_remote` key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a high privileged user to send the crafted HTTP requests.

**Technical details:**
The vulnerable code is within the `set_ike_profile` function, which is called by `vpn_dmvpn_handler_set`.
The `secrets_remote` value from the JSON request is used in a `sprintf` call to construct a command string:

```c
is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"secrets_remote");
if (is_equal == 0) {
        if(version != 1){
            command_argument = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
            command_format_string = "pre-shared-key remote %s";
            [...]
        }
    }
[...]
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,command_format_string,command_argument);
```
The `command_argument` variable takes the string value of the `secrets_remote` parameter from the HTTP request. If the `secrets_remote` value is larger than the `vtysh_command_buffer` size, then a stack-based buffer overflow will occur.
The provided exploit PoC demonstrates this:
```json
{
	"id": 7,
	"execute": 1,
	"core": "yruo_vpn_ipsec_client",
	"function": "set",
	"values": [
		{
			"base": "yruo_vpn_ipsec_client",
			"index": 1,
			"value": {
				"secrets_remote": "A"*0x300,
				"version": 2,
			}
		}
	]
}
```
This JSON payload sets a large string of "A" characters as the value for `secrets_remote`, triggering a buffer overflow.
