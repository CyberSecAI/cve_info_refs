- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Resize at Upload Plus WordPress plugin lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions available through the vulnerable plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor would craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) on a WordPress site with the vulnerable plugin installed, would perform actions on their behalf without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator or other high privileged user into triggering a malicious request. This could be achieved through social engineering, such as including the malicious link in an email or on another site. The attacker does not need to have an account on the target system.
