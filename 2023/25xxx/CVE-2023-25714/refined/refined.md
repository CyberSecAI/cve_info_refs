- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a broken access control issue, specifically a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The vulnerability is due to missing checks that should restrict access to certain functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not specified beyond the lack of access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be any user.
