Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-25098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of an unsafe `sprintf` function within the `set_qos` function of the `vtysh_ubus` binary in Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, the `source` parameter, received from a JSON request, is directly used in the `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The `sprintf` function writes data into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) on the stack. If the input data is larger than the buffer, it overwrites adjacent memory, causing a buffer overflow.
- **Unsafe Use of sprintf:** The code uses `sprintf` with user-controlled data without validating the length of that data before using it as an argument to `sprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and other critical data on the stack, allowing them to potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Device Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint. The request includes a JSON payload that contains a long string for the "source" field.
- **Specific Core and Function:** The vulnerable code is reached when the "core" is set to `yruo_qos_download` and the "function" is set to `set`, under the `rule_list` context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user to send the necessary HTTP requests that trigger this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device to send the malicious HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet within `set_qos` function:
  ```c
    if (source != 0) {
        if (*source == 0) {
            [...]
        }
        else{
            sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"match source %s",source);
        }
        [...]
    }
```
- The vulnerable JSON payload includes a "rule\_list" where the source is a large string
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_qos_download",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_qos_upload",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "rule_list":[{
                    'rule_name':'A',
                    'source':'A'*0x300,
                    "action":2,
                }]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
