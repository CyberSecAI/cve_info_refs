The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25187.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded default SSH public/private key values in Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures for network operator specific settings. These default keys are installed at the factory and meant to be changed during the BTS deployment commissioning phase, but prior to the 21B release, there were no instructions to do so. The presence of these default keys creates a potential vulnerability if the SSH server is enabled, particularly during troubleshooting activities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of hard-coded credentials (SSH public/private keys)
- Lack of proper instruction in commissioning manuals to change default keys during BTS deployment (prior to 21B release).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks during troubleshooting activities.
- Unauthorized access to BTS service user accounts by malicious operational staff inside the CSP network.
- The vulnerability does not grant direct access to the BTS itself, as service user authentication is username/password based. However, it facilitates MITM attacks to intercept credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is limited to the CSP mobile network's internal BTS management network.
- Exploitation is not possible from mobile network user UEs, roaming networks, or the Internet.
- The BTS SSH server, which is disabled by default, must be enabled.
- Attackers need to be malicious operation staff from within the CSP network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Malicious operability staff within the CSP network with access to the internal BTS management network.
- Ability to enable the BTS SSH server which is disabled by default.
- Ability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack when the SSH server is enabled.

**Affected products and versions:**
- Nokia ASIKA Airscale running Nokia Single RAN SW releases 19B, 20A, 20B, 20C, and 21A.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in SRAN 21B and later releases by changing Nokia default SSH keys to operator-specific keys during the BTS commissioning procedure.
