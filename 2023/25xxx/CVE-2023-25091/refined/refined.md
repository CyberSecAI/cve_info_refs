Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25091:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of the Milesight UR32L router. The `sprintf` function is used to construct commands to be executed by the router's command-line interface (CLI).
*   The `sprintf` function is vulnerable because it doesn't perform bounds checking on the input, which can allow an attacker to write past the end of the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. When `sprintf` copies user-provided data into the `vtysh_command_buffer` without proper size validation, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Unsafe use of `sprintf`:** The `sprintf` function is inherently unsafe when used with user-controlled data. The lack of bounds checking is the core issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially including return addresses. This can allow them to redirect the program's execution flow to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.
*   **Denial of Service:** At a minimum, exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to a crash of the `vtysh_ubus` binary, causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint of the router. The POST data includes JSON payloads with specific keys and values designed to trigger the vulnerable `sprintf` calls.
*   **JSON payloads**: The `values` array within the JSON payload can be crafted to supply the overflow by specifying long strings to vulnerable keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges to send the malicious HTTP requests, implying that the attacker needs to be authenticated with sufficient rights.

**Specific details related to CVE-2023-25091:**

*   **Vulnerable function:** `handle_interface_acl`
*   **Vulnerable parameter:** `interface` , when `out_acl` is -1.
*   **Vulnerable code snippet:**
    ```c
    if (out_acl != -2) {
        if (out_acl == -1) {
            [...]
            sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"no firewall-acl interface %s access-group out",interface);
            [...]
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Exploit Proof of Concept**:

                "value": {
                    "interface": "A"*0x300,
                    "out_acl":-1,
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
