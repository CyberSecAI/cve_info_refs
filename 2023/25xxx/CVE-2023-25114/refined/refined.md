The provided document contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-25114, affecting the Milesight UR32L router.

**CVE-2023-25114**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5 due to the use of an unsafe `sprintf` pattern.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `set_openvpn_client` function uses `sprintf` to format a command string, using the value of `expert_options` JSON key as part of the command. This user controlled input is not validated or size checked allowing a buffer overflow to occur.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.
*   **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to send the malicious HTTP request.

**Technical Details (specific to CVE-2023-25114):**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```c
    is_equal = strcmp(table_key,"expert_options");
    if (is_equal != 0) {
        [...]
    }
    expert_options = blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
    
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"options %s",expert_options);
    ```
*   A JSON payload example to trigger the vulnerability is:
    ```json
    {
        "id": 9,
        "execute": 1,
        "core": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
        "function": "set",
        "values": [
            {
                "base": "yruo_vpn_openvpn_client",
                "index": 1,
                "value": {
                    "expert_options": "A"*0x600,
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    This payload sets the `expert_options` to a string of 0x600 'A' characters, causing the `sprintf` to write beyond the buffer's boundary.
