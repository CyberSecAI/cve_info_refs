Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data in the `handle_interface_acl` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of Milesight UR32L routers. Specifically, the `interface` parameter, which is obtained from a JSON request, is directly used in an `sprintf` call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The `sprintf` function copies the `interface` string into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) without proper bounds checking. When the length of the `interface` string exceeds the buffer's capacity, it leads to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to overwrite return addresses and other critical data on the stack, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the `vtysh_ubus` process.
- **Denial of Service:** A less sophisticated attack could cause the process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint of the Milesight router.
- **JSON Payload:** The malicious data is embedded within the `values` array of the JSON payload, specifically within the `interface` key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges to send the malicious HTTP requests.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Milesight router to send the crafted HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code resides within the `handle_interface_acl` function, which is called by the `firewall_handler_set` function.
- The `interface` value, obtained from the JSON data, is directly used in `sprintf` without any size checks.
- The `in_acl` value is checked for -1, which triggers the vulnerable `sprintf` statement.

**Specific Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

```c
if (in_acl != -2) {
    if (in_acl == -1) {
        [...]
        sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"no firewall-acl interface %s access-group in",interface);
        [...]
    }
    [...]
}
```

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**

The provided JSON payload shows how the `interface` parameter can be controlled by the attacker to cause a crash:
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_firewall_mac_binding",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_firewall_acl",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "interface": "A"*0x300,
                "in_acl": -1,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In this example, an "interface" string of 0x300 bytes will overflow the buffer when passed to the vulnerable sprintf function.
