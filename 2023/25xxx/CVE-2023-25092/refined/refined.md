Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-25092:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the use of an unsafe `sprintf` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary of the Milesight UR32L router. This function is used to construct commands by concatenating user-supplied data with format strings, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow** - The `sprintf` function writes beyond the allocated buffer `vtysh_command_buffer` on the stack when provided with overly long user-controlled strings.
*   The `vtysh_ubus` binary parses JSON data from HTTP requests. Specifically, the `interface` and `out_acl` keys are used to fetch values that are then passed to the vulnerable sprintf function.
*   The `handle_interface_acl` function is called, which uses the values from the aforementioned keys to construct a command string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to overwrite portions of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.
*   **Device Compromise:** This can result in full compromise of the device, giving the attacker control over its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint of the router.
*   **JSON Payload:** The malicious data is included within the "values" field of the JSON payload, specifically within the `interface` and `out_acl` keys under the `yruo_firewall_acl` base.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker must have high privileges on the router in order to send these crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router to send the malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the structure and endpoint for the router's API as well as which parameters to send to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Specifics for CVE-2023-25092:**

*   The `interface` and `out_acl` JSON keys are used to fetch their respective values.
*   The vulnerability lies in the `handle_interface_acl` function:
    ```c
    sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"firewall-acl interface %s access-group %d out",interface, out_acl);
    ```
*   By providing a long string for the `interface` parameter, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow in `vtysh_command_buffer`.

**Exploit Proof of Concept:**
The following JSON payload will cause the `vtysh_ubus` binary to crash:

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_firewall_mac_binding",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_firewall_acl",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "interface": "A"*0x300,
                "out_acl":10,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report includes other similar vulnerabilities with different parameters, all stemming from the same insecure `sprintf` usage pattern, and which use different cores, functions and parameters.
*   The vendor did not release a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.
