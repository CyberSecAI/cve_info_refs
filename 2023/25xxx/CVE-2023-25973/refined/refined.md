- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Auto Affiliate Links plugin versions <= 6.3.0.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to perform actions as a higher-privileged user, leading to potential modification of plugin settings, or other unauthorized actions within the WordPress application
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into triggering it, resulting in the execution of unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in, high-privilege user to click a malicious link or submit a form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress application.
