     "details":{
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient length checking of the `av_pair` elements when decoding target information.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"
      ],
      "impact": "An out-of-bounds read can be triggered, potentially leading to a denial-of-service if the read accesses unmapped memory.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered via the `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input to the `gss_accept_sec_context` function.",
      "additional_notes": "The commit message `GHSL-2023-011: Out-of-bounds read when decoding` further clarifies that the vulnerability occurs in the target information decoding process, specifically when processing `MSV_AV_TIMESTAMP` and `MSV_AV_FLAGS` types. The fix involves adding length checks for these types. The vulnerability was found by GitHub Security Lab team via oss-fuzz."
