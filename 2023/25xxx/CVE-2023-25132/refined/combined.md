**CyberPower** **PowerPanel Business for Linux**
is an advanced power management software designed to monitor and manage CyberPower UPS systems and network-connected ATS/PDUs. The software features an intuitive and color-coded interface for instant confirmation of power status and system alerts. PowerPanel Business offers a variety of options and customizable settings, such as unattended shutdown of computers and virtual machines connected to a battery backup during a power event, automatic event notification via email, SMS, and instant messaging, scheduling of shutdowns and restarts, history event logging for tracking and analyzing trends, user-programmable command scripts for customizing event actions, and much more. In addition, the software allows remote access and management via a web browser, ensuring a smooth operation of your system.
The software is divided into PowerPanel Business LOCAL, REMOTE and MANAGEMENT, to fulfill different levels of power management.
LOCAL allows you to manage the UPS systems locally and perform graceful shutdown for computers connected via USB or serial cable.
REMOTE provides remote management and automatic shutdown for network-connected equipment through RMCARD installed in the UPS systems.
MANAGEMENT provides monitoring and management for multiple UPS systems and PDUs via network.
Furthermore, PowerPanel Business LOCAL supports cloud solution, which allows users to add the UPS to PowerPanel Cloud, thus enabling system monitoring on the go through a secure web portal or mobile app. To access the UPS details through the PowerPanel Cloud service, plan purchase is required. All CyberPower single-phased UPS models are bundled with a free trial. Standard free trial is 30 days. For selected UPS models (all model names starting with OL, PR, OR, or including PFC characters), the trial is extended to 90 days. CyberPower reserves the right to adjust the content of free trial at any time without prior notice.

**CyberPower** **PowerPanel Business for Virtual Machine**
is an advanced power management software designed to monitor and manage CyberPower UPS systems and network-connected ATS/PDUs. The software features an intuitive and color-coded interface for instant confirmation of power status and system alerts. PowerPanel Business offers a variety of options and customizable settings, such as unattended shutdown of computers and virtual machines connected to a battery backup during a power event, automatic event notification via email, SMS, and instant messaging, scheduling of shutdowns and restarts, history event logging for tracking and analyzing trends, user-programmable command scripts for customizing event actions, and much more. In addition, the software allows remote access and management via a web browser, ensuring a smooth operation of your system.
The software is divided into PowerPanel Business LOCAL, REMOTE and MANAGEMENT, to fulfill different levels of power management.
LOCAL allows you to manage the UPS systems locally and perform graceful shutdown for computers connected via USB or serial cable.
REMOTE provides remote management and automatic shutdown for network-connected equipment through RMCARD installed in the UPS systems.
MANAGEMENT provides monitoring and management for multiple UPS systems and PDUs via network.
Furthermore, PowerPanel Business LOCAL supports cloud solution, which allows users to add the UPS to PowerPanel Cloud, thus enabling system monitoring on the go through a secure web portal or mobile app. To access the UPS details through the PowerPanel Cloud service, plan purchase is required. All CyberPower single-phased UPS models are bundled with a free trial. Standard free trial is 30 days. For selected UPS models (all model names starting with OL, PR, OR, or including PFC characters), the trial is extended to 90 days. CyberPower reserves the right to adjust the content of free trial at any time without prior notice.

**CyberPower** **PowerPanel Business for Mac**
is an advanced power management software designed to monitor and manage CyberPower UPS systems and network-connected ATS/PDUs. The software features an intuitive and color-coded interface for instant confirmation of power status and system alerts. PowerPanel Business offers a variety of options and customizable settings, such as unattended shutdown of computers and virtual machines connected to a battery backup during a power event, automatic event notification via email, SMS, and instant messaging, scheduling of shutdowns and restarts, history event logging for tracking and analyzing trends, user-programmable command scripts for customizing event actions, and much more. In addition, the software allows remote access and management via a web browser, ensuring a smooth operation of your system.
The software is divided into PowerPanel Business LOCAL, REMOTE and MANAGEMENT, to fulfill different levels of power management.
LOCAL allows you to manage the UPS systems locally and perform graceful shutdown for computers connected via USB or serial cable.
REMOTE provides remote management and automatic shutdown for network-connected equipment through RMCARD installed in the UPS systems.
MANAGEMENT provides monitoring and management for multiple UPS systems and PDUs via network.
Furthermore, PowerPanel Business LOCAL supports cloud solution, which allows users to add the UPS to PowerPanel Cloud, thus enabling system monitoring on the go through a secure web portal or mobile app. To access the UPS details through the PowerPanel Cloud service, plan purchase is required. All CyberPower single-phased UPS models are bundled with a free trial. Standard free trial is 30 days. For selected UPS models (all model names starting with OL, PR, OR, or including PFC characters), the trial is extended to 90 days. CyberPower reserves the right to adjust the content of free trial at any time without prior notice.

**CyberPower** **PowerPanel Business for Windows**
is an advanced power management software designed to monitor and manage CyberPower UPS systems and network-connected ATS/PDUs. The software features an intuitive and color-coded interface for instant confirmation of power status and system alerts. PowerPanel Business offers a variety of options and customizable settings, such as unattended shutdown of computers and virtual machines connected to a battery backup during a power event, automatic event notification via email, SMS, and instant messaging, scheduling of shutdowns and restarts, history event logging for tracking and analyzing trends, user-programmable command scripts for customizing event actions, and much more. In addition, the software allows remote access and management via a web browser, ensuring a smooth operation of your system.
The software is divided into PowerPanel Business LOCAL, REMOTE and MANAGEMENT, to fulfill different levels of power management.
LOCAL allows you to manage the UPS systems locally and perform graceful shutdown for computers connected via USB or serial cable.
REMOTE provides remote management and automatic shutdown for network-connected equipment through RMCARD installed in the UPS systems.
MANAGEMENT provides monitoring and management for multiple UPS systems and PDUs via network.
Furthermore, PowerPanel Business LOCAL supports cloud solution, which allows users to add the UPS to PowerPanel Cloud, thus enabling system monitoring on the go through a secure web portal or mobile app. To access the UPS details through the PowerPanel Cloud service, plan purchase is required. All CyberPower single-phased UPS models are bundled with a free trial. Standard free trial is 30 days. For selected UPS models (all model names starting with OL, PR, OR, or including PFC characters), the trial is extended to 90 days. CyberPower reserves the right to adjust the content of free trial at any time without prior notice.
