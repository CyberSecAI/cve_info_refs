# Excessive memory allocation on verification

Moderate

[shizhMSFT](/shizhMSFT)
published
GHSA-87x9-7grx-m28v
Feb 20, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/notaryproject/notation-go
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 0.9.0-alpha.1

## Patched versions

1.0.0-rc.3

## Description

### Impact

`notation-go` users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures and the application will be finally killed, and thus availability is impacted.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the release [v1.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3). Users should upgrade their `notation-go` packages to `v1.0.0-rc.3` or above.

### Workarounds

Users can review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is set to `enforce`

### Credits

The `notation-go` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski ([@AdamKorcz](https://github.com/AdamKorcz)) for responsibly disclosing this issue during a security fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF and Shiwei Zhang ([@shizhMSFT](https://github.com/shizhMSFT)) for root cause analysis and detailed vulnerability report.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID
