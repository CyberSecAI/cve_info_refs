# Path traversal with mrpack files

High

[RyanTheAllmighty](/RyanTheAllmighty)
published
GHSA-7cff-8xv4-mvx6
Feb 4, 2023

## Package

https://github.com/ATLauncher/ATLauncher
(Software)

## Affected versions

<= 3.4.26.0

## Patched versions

3.4.27.0

## Description

### Impact

When manually importing a .mrpack file, path traversal was possible, and files could be downloaded by the launcher into places outside it's own directory using a specially crafted path string in the `modrinth.index.json` within the .mrpack file.

### Patches

Upgrade to version 3.4.27.0 (the launcher auto updates itself as long as you're not using AUR or Flatpak)

### Workarounds

Do not install any .mrpack modpack manually. Modpacks installed through the launchers Modrinth pack browser are safe.

### References

<https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/format_definition/#files>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
