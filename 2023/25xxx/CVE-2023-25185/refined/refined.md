    - Limited impact on Availability (A:L)

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability is exploitable through local access to the BTS system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have High privileges (PR:H) on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple services of Nokia ASIKA Airscale products
