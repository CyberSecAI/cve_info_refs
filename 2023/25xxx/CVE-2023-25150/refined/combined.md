# Document content of files can be obtained through Collabora for files of other users

Moderate

[miaulalala](/miaulalala)
published
GHSA-64xc-r58v-53gj
Feb 8, 2023

## Package

Office (Richdocuments)
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 7.0.2, < 6.3.2, < 5.0.10, <4.2.9, < 3.8.7

## Patched versions

7.0.2, 6.3.2, 5.0.10, 4.2.9, 3.8.7

## Description

### Impact

When tricking Collabora to reuse a valid access token with a file id of another users file a copy of the file can be obtained without proper permission validation. Any user with access to Collabora can obtain the content of other users files.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office App (Collabora Integration) is updated to

7.0.2 (Nextcloud 25)

6.3.2 (Nextcloud 24)

5.0.10 (Nextcloud 23)

4.2.9 (Nextcloud 21-22)

3.8.7 (Nextcloud 15-20)

### Workarounds

No workaround available

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
