**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** The core vulnerability is an arbitrary file download issue.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The backend does not adequately validate user-supplied input, specifically in the context of file paths for download requests.
- **Missing Path Restrictions:** There is no proper restriction on the file paths that can be requested, allowing access to sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the system.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data may be exposed through unauthorized file access, if the attacker can download relevant files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the download interface.
- By modifying the request parameters, an attacker can manipulate the file path, and initiate the download of arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Permission:** The attacker needs to have valid user permission to access the download interface to exploit the vulnerability.
