```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data when constructing commands for execution. The `sprintf` function does not perform bounds checking, allowing for a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the destination buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to use of `sprintf` with unsanitized user-controlled input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with specific JSON data to the `/cgi` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires high privileges to send the HTTP requests that trigger the vulnerability."
