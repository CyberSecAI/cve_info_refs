Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when rendering web pages. Specifically, it is an HTML injection issue in Portal for ArcGIS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The application fails to properly neutralize user-controlled input that is used to generate HTML content, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
*   The identified CWE is CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). Although categorized as a cross-site scripting vulnerability, this is specifically an HTML injection issue.
