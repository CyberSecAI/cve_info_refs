# Integer Overflow in several Redis commands can lead to denial of service.

Moderate

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-x2r7-j9vw-3w83
Feb 28, 2023

## Package

redis-server

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

7.0.9, 6.2.11, 6.0.18

## Description

### Impact

Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process.

This problem affects all Redis versions.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.

### Credit

The issue has been identified by Yupeng Yang.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[`8692053`](/redis/redis/commit/86920532f72ff005fcb146c5a02562f9a10b8140)

Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2023-25155) Specially crafted SRANDMEMBER, ZRANDMEMBER, and HRANDFIELD

  commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion

  and termination of the Redis server process.
* (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like SCAN or KEYS) with a specially

  crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it to

  hang and consume 100% CPU time.

# Bug Fixes

* Fix a crash when reaching the maximum invalidations limit of client-side tracking ([#11814](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11814))
* Fix a crash when SPUBLISH is used after passing the cluster-link-sendbuf-limit ([#11752](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11752))
* Fix possible memory corruption in FLUSHALL when a client watches more than one key ([#11854](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11854))
* Fix cluster inbound link keepalive time ([#11785](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11785))
* Flush propagation list in active-expire of writable replicas to fix an assertion ([#11615](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11615))
* Avoid propagating DEL of lazy expire from SCAN and RANDOMKEY as MULTI-EXEC ([#11788](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11788))

# Performance and resource utilization improvements

* Avoid realloc to reduce size of strings when it is unneeded ([#11766](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11766))
* Improve CLUSTER SLOTS reply efficiency for non-continuous slots ([#11745](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11745))

[`ebe2e45`](/redis/redis/commit/ebe2e4583fc6b4cd1a8142caa51fa7c8d37d6de3)

Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2023-25155) Specially crafted SRANDMEMBER, ZRANDMEMBER, and HRANDFIELD

  commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion

  and termination of the Redis server process.
* (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like SCAN or KEYS) with a specially

  crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it to

  hang and consume 100% CPU time.

# Bug Fixes

* Make sure that fork child doesn't do incremental rehashing ([#11692](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11692))
* Fix cluster inbound link keepalive time ([#11785](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11785))
