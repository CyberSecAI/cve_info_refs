Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The vulnerability arises when these commands are provided with a specially crafted negative long value that is greater than the maximum positive value that the long can store. This leads to an integer overflow during the processing of the provided count argument.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The integer overflow results in a runtime assertion, which causes the Redis server process to terminate, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

- Authenticated users can exploit the vulnerability by issuing specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands with a negative long value as the count parameter that exceeds the maximum positive value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Redis server.
- They must have the ability to send commands to the Redis server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of Redis prior to the patched versions.
- Patched versions include: 6.0.18, 6.2.11, and 7.0.9.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.
- The CVSS v3 base metrics are:
    - Attack vector: Local
    - Attack complexity: Low
    - Privileges required: Low
    - User interaction: None
    - Scope: Unchanged
    - Confidentiality: None
    - Integrity: None
    - Availability: High
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-190.

The provided commit diffs show the fix by adding a check to validate that the given count is not outside the valid range and will return an error if it is.
