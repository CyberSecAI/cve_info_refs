- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cuobjdump` tool in NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to a malformed input file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker tricks a user into running `cuobjdump` on a malformed input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed input file and trick a local user to run `cuobjdump` on that file. The user interaction is required. The attacker does not need privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
