- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mendix SAML module insufficiently verifies SAML assertions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm (CWE-303), leading to insufficient verification of SAML assertions. This allows for authentication bypass when the "Use Encryption" configuration option is disabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely. The attacker needs to manipulate SAML assertions.
