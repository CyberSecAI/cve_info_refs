SSA-851884: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Mendix SAML
Module

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.1

2023-03-14

V1.2

SUMMARY

The Mendix SAML module insufﬁciently veriﬁes the SAML assertions. This could allow unauthenticated
remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application.

Mendix has provided ﬁx releases for the Mendix SAML module and recommends to update to the latest
version.

Note: For compatibility reasons, ﬁxes for several versions of the Mendix SAML module were introduced in
two release steps:

• The ﬁrst ﬁx versions address CVE-2023-25957.

It removes the vulnerability, except when the

recommended, default conﬁguration option

Use Encryption

is disabled.

’

’

• The second ﬁx versions address CVE-2023-29129, which removes the issue for the non default

conﬁguration as well.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-25957

The affected versions of the module insufﬁciently verify the SAML assertions. This could allow
unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application.

For compatibility reasons, ﬁx versions still contain this issue, but only when the recommended, default
conﬁguration option

Use Encryption

is disabled.
