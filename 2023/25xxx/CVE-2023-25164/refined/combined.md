# Sensitive Information leak via Script File in TinaCMS

High

[jamespohalloran](/jamespohalloran)
published
GHSA-pc2q-jcxq-rjrr
Feb 8, 2023

## Package

npm

@tinacms/cli
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0, < 1.0.9

## Patched versions

1.0.9

## Description

### Impact

Sensitive Information leaked via script File in TinaCMS. Sites building with @tinacms/cli >= 1.0.0 && < 1.0.9 that store sensitive values in process.env var are impacted. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you.

If your Tina-enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9

### Workarounds

Upgrading, and rotating secure & exposed keys is required for the proper fix.

### References

[#3584](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/3584)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @logan-anderson **[logan-anderson](/logan-anderson)** commented [Feb 6, 2023](#issue-1573259648) • edited by jamespohalloran Loading

Fixes [#3579](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues/3579) by exposing `NODE_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `TINA_PUBLIC_*`, and `HEAD` (for integration with Netifly) environment vars in the admin.

--

Update:

To address this, update @tinacms/cli to the latest patch 1.0.9. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you.

Tina credentials like the API token are not considered especially vulnerable because they're for read-only access. Nevertheless, it may be a good idea to update them.

More importantly, if your Tina-enabled website has other credentials (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately.

Going forward, if you're using environment variables in any field customization (ie. ui.component functions), you'll need to make sure those are prefixed with TINA\_PUBLIC\_ (NEXT\_PUBLIC\_ is also supported).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Will this need some documentation for the whitelist? Looks like `TINA__CLIENT_ID` and `TINA__TOKEN` are now `TINA_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_PUBLIC_TOKEN` which I assume would be a breaking change for many.  Also unclear what your policies are around security leaks, but as a user I would want to know that my secure build credentials may have leaked to publicly accessible files so I could deal with it and roll credentials if required. |
