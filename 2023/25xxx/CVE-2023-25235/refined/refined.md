Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `formOneSsidCfgSet` function of the Tenda Router AC500.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `formOneSsidCfgSet` function copies user-provided input from the `ssid` parameter into a stack-based buffer using `strcpy` without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By overflowing the buffer, the attacker can cause the router's process to crash or malfunction, leading to loss of network connectivity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/setOneSsidCfg` page.
- The malicious payload is included as a long string in the `ssid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically requires being on the same local network as the router, or if remote access to the router's web interface is enabled, the attacker can exploit it remotely.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function `formOneSsidCfgSet` receives the `ssid` parameter from the HTTP request.
- The value of the `ssid` parameter is copied to the local `src` variable, then passed to `strcpy` which writes the contents into a fixed-size buffer named `s`.
- Because `strcpy` doesn't perform any bounds check, providing an `ssid` string larger than buffer `s` will result in a buffer overflow, which overwrites stack memory.
- The proof-of-concept code provided demonstrates sending a GET request with a 100-character string for the `ssid` parameter, which is enough to trigger the crash and DoS.
