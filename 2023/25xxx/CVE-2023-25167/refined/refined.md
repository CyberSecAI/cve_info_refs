The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25167.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) in how Discourse handles git URLs. Specifically, the regex used to validate SSH git URLs was vulnerable to ReDoS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inefficient regular expression susceptible to ReDoS

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted git URL, which can make the server unavailable due to resource exhaustion by the regex engine.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack using malicious git URLs provided by a low privileged user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user capable of providing a malicious git URL to the vulnerable system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Discourse versions up to stable 3.0, beta 3.1.0.beta1, and tests-passed 3.1.0.beta1.
- The fix is available in stable 3.0.1, beta 3.1.0.beta2, and tests-passed 3.1.0.beta2 and later versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed by making the SSH URL regex unambiguous and is tracked in commit ec4c302.
- The vulnerable regex is `SSH_REGEXP = /(\w+@(\w+\.)*\w+):(.\*)/` and the fix changes it to `SSH_REGEXP = /\A(\w+@\w+(\.\w+)*):(.\*)\z/`
