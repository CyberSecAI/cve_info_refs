The provided content details a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Reviewer Management System v1.0 by janobe.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize the `courseID` parameter in the `course-update.php` script before displaying it in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization.

This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions. The provided example shows the ability to execute alert box and obtain cookies.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically by manipulating the `courseID` GET parameter. The attacker needs to entice the victim to click on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and lure the victim into clicking it. No special capabilities are needed otherwise.

The content provides detailed proof-of-concept (POC) including example HTTP requests and screenshots showing the successful execution of the XSS payloads. The vulnerable file is `/reviewer_0/admins/assessments/course/course-update.php`.
