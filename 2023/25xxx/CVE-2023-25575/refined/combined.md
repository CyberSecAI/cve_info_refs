## Package

composer

api-platform/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.10
< 3.0.12
< 3.1.3
>= 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.7.10
3.0.12

2.7.10

## Description

### Impact

Resource properties secured with the `security` option of the `ApiPlatform\Metadata\ApiProperty` attribute can be disclosed to unauthorized users. The problem affects most serialization formats, including raw JSON, which is enabled by default when installing API Platform. Custom serialization formats may also be impacted. Only collection endpoints are affected by the issue, item endpoints are not. The JSON-LD format is not affected by the issue.

The result of the security rule is only executed for the first item of the collection. The result of the rule is then cached and reused for the next items. This bug can leak data to unauthorized users when the rule depends on the value of a property of the item. This bug can also hide properties that should be displayed to authorized users.

### Patches

This issue impacts the 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1 branches. Upgrade to v2.7.10, v3.0.12 or v3.1.3.

### Workarounds

Replace the `cache_key` of the context array of the Serializer inside a custom normalizer that works on objects if the security option of the `ApiPlatform\Metadata\ApiProperty` attribute is used.

### References

No.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
