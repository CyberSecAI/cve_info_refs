The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25884.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program attempts to access a memory location outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer or data structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system. The attack complexity is low (AC:L). No privileges are required (PR:N), but user interaction (UI:R) is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to trigger the vulnerable code through user interaction.
