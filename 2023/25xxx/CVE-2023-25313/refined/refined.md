Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the "Video Link" field when embedding a video. Specifically, the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE, where arbitrary code execution is achieved via the injected URL.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize user-supplied URLs in the "Embed a video link" feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is hosted.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can potentially lead to complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Video Embedding Feature:** The vulnerability lies in the "Embed a video link" feature of the application.
- **Malicious URL Injection:** An attacker injects a malicious URL containing code into the Video Link field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to "My Videos" Tab:** The attacker must be able to access the "My Videos" tab in the application.
- **Ability to use the "Embed a video link" functionality:** The attacker must be able to interact with the "Embed a video link" option.
- **Knowledge of an exploit payload:** The attacker must know how to craft a malicious URL containing a command to be executed.
