- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through a CSRF attack, forcing an authenticated user to unknowingly perform actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while they are authenticated to the target website with the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target site.
