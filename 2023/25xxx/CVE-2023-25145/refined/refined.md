Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-25145

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Trend Micro Apex One RealTime Scan Service.
- It involves the abuse of mount points to delete folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of mount points by the RealTime Scan Service, leading to arbitrary file/folder deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker who already has the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Creation of a mount point to trigger the vulnerability in the Trend Micro service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Ability to create mount points.

**Summary:**

A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Trend Micro Apex One Security Agent. A low-privileged attacker can create a mount point, which then is improperly handled by the NT Apex One RealTime Scan Service leading to arbitrary folder deletion. This can then be leveraged to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
