- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector would involve exploiting the function lacking proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user) to exploit the vulnerability.
