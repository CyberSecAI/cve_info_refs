{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of `sprintf` with user-controlled data when constructing commands for another service, leading to a buffer overflow when the size of the user-provided data exceeds the buffer capacity.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to unsafe usage of sprintf",
    "Lack of input validation or sanitization of user-controlled data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi` endpoint with specific JSON data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires high privileges to send the crafted HTTP requests."
