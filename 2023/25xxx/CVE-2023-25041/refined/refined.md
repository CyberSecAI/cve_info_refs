**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would then be executed when visitors access the site, potentially leading to:
    * Redirecting users to malicious sites
    * Displaying unwanted advertisements
    * Stealing user session cookies
    * Defacing the website
    * Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts, likely through user-supplied input or vulnerable theme functionality, into the website. The specific injection point is not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable input field or through a vulnerability in the theme functionality. The report indicates the required privilege is "Unauthenticated" meaning anyone can potentially exploit the vulnerability, without having to login or provide credentials to the website.
