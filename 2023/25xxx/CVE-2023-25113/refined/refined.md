- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The `vtysh_ubus` binary in Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5 is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows due to the use of `sprintf` with user-controlled data when constructing commands for other services.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    - **CWE-121**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow. The `sprintf` function is used to write into a fixed-size buffer (`vtysh_command_buffer`) without proper bounds checking.  User-provided inputs through HTTP POST requests can overflow this buffer.
    - Unsafe use of `sprintf`: The code constructs commands using `sprintf` without validating the length of the input strings.  These strings are derived from the JSON data in HTTP requests.

- **Impact of Exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing the `vtysh_command_buffer`, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and potentially gain control of the program execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    - System compromise: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to completely compromise the device.

- **Attack Vectors**:
    - **HTTP Requests**: An attacker sends specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi` endpoint, targeting vulnerable functionalities (cores and functions).
    - **JSON Data**: The malicious payload is embedded within the JSON data of the POST request. The specific vulnerable parameters are identified for each CVE.
    - **`vtysh_ubus` Binary**: The vulnerabilities are located in the `vtysh_ubus` binary, which is responsible for parsing the request and constructing commands.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    - **High Privileges**: The attacker needs to be a high privileged user to send HTTP requests that can trigger the vulnerabilities.
    - **Network Access**: The attacker must have network access to the Milesight UR32L device.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters for CVE-2023-25113:**
- The `key` JSON key used in the `vpn_l2tp_handler_set` function, specifically the `set_l2tp` function, leads to a buffer overflow when passed to the vulnerable `sprintf` call.

```
sprintf(vtysh_command_buffer,"secret %s",key);
```
