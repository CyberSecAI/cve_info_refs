# TimescaleDB 2.8.0 through 2.9.2 has incorrect access control

High

[thanasisk](/thanasisk)
published
GHSA-44jh-j22r-33wq
Feb 14, 2023

## Package

TimescaleDB
(TimescaleDB)

## Affected versions

2.8.0 through 2.9.2

## Patched versions

2.9.3

## Description

### Summary

During installation TimescaleDB creates a telemetry job that is runs as the installation user. The queries run as part of the telemetry data collection were not run with a locked down `search_path` allowing malicious users to create functions that would be executed by the telemetry job leading to privilege escalation.

In order to be able to take advantage of this vulnerability, a user would need to be able to create objects in a database and then get a superuser to install TimescaleDB into their database. When TimescaleDB is installed as trusted extension non-superusers can install the extension without help from a superuser.

### Fix

Upgrade to TimescaleDB 2.9.3.

### Workarounds

As a mitigation the `search_path` of the user running the telemetry job can be locked down to not include schemas writable by other users.

### Affected Platforms

The vulnerability is not exploitable on instances in Timescale Cloud and Managed Service for TimescaleDB due to additional security provisions in place on those platforms.

### Severity

High

8.8

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
