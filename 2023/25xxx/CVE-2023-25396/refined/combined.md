# Advanced Installer 20.1 Release Notes

On November 16th, 2022 Caphyon Ltd. is proud to announce the release of **Advanced
Installer 20.1** in *Free, Professional, Enterprise and Architect* editions. This release is available for [download](download.html "Advanced Installer - Download") on the Advanced Installer website.

Starting with version 20 of Advanced Installer, you are able to
**download and install prerequisites in
parallel**.

Once the first prerequisite is completely downloaded its
installation begins while additional prerequisites continue to be
downloaded, resulting in a **faster installation of the
application**.

You can even customize the installer to include a modern
progress bar. As a result, every user will be aware of the status of
both the download and installation processes, as well as which
prerequisite is currently downloading or installing.

Watch the video below to learn how to download and install
prerequisites in parallel:

New features, bug fixes, and general improvements are included
in the current release. See the full list below.
