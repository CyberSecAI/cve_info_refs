{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The error condition incorrectly assumed that the `cb` and `sh` buffers would contain a copy of the data that needed to be freed. This assumption was incorrect, leading to a double free.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect free",
    "Double free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can trigger an assertion failure in `free`, leading to a denial of service. Potentially memory corruption may occur depending on the contents of the target_info buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via the `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path by providing a crafted target information during the NTLM authentication handshake."
