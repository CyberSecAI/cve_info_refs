- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of memory after it has been freed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described in detail, but it involves a local attack (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R) for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to get a user to interact with a crafted file or otherwise trigger the vulnerability locally. No special privileges are needed (PR:N).
