- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Interactive SVG Image Map Builder WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable plugin. The user accessing the page with the injected script must have the required privileges to execute it. The page where the injected script is present must be accessed by a user to trigger the execution. The report states "Administrator" privilege is required, but does not explicitly specify if this is the attacker's or the victim's privilege level.
