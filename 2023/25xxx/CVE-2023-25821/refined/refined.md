Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Nextcloud handles share updates, specifically when a user reshared a file/folder. When updating a share, the system was loading the node (file/folder) from the *owner* instead of the *initiator* of the share. This discrepancy caused a bypass of the secure view for internal shares when reshare permissions were granted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The system failed to properly validate the access rights when a reshare occurred, leading to a circumvention of intended security measures. The system incorrectly assumed the share's owner should be used to determine permissions rather than the initiator.
- **Bypass of Secure View:** The secure view feature for internal shares could be bypassed because the reshared access was not treated as a new share but rather an update to the original share, failing to inherit proper access controls.
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-284, which accurately describes the nature of the issue: improper access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to files and folders that were intended to be protected by secure view settings within internal shares.
- **Data Exposure:** Users with reshare permissions could access data they were not meant to see, breaching data confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- **Reshare Permissions:** The attack vector involves a user with the ability to reshare a file or folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges (PR:L):** The attacker needs low privileges, meaning they need to be a valid user within the Nextcloud instance.
- **User Interaction (UI:R):** The attacker needs to perform a user interaction (i.e., make a reshare).
- **Reshare permissions:** The attacker needs reshare permission on a file or folder.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is addressed in Nextcloud Server versions 24.0.7 and 25.0.1 and later.
- **No Workarounds:**  There are no available workarounds other than upgrading the Nextcloud Server.
- **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.7.
- **Fix:** The fix involved ensuring that share updates load the node from the *initiator* of the reshare rather than the *owner*.
- **Pull Request:** The fix is detailed in [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/34502), which contains code changes to resolve the vulnerability.
