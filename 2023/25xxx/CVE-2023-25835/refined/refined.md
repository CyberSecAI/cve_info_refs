    - **Availability disruptions:** Denial-of-service by manipulating the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, authenticated attacker:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the system.
- **Crafted link:** The attacker creates a malicious link that, when clicked by a victim, triggers the XSS vulnerability.
