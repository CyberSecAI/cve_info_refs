The provided content relates to CVE-2023-21025.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- A potential out-of-bounds read in libufdt when reading beyond the property value in fixup arrays. The fixup offset property was not validated to be a list of fdt32_t, leading to incorrect processing.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of the intended memory region.

Impact of exploitation:
- Information disclosure: Reading data from an unintended location can expose sensitive information.

Attack vectors:
- Crafted device tree: A malicious actor could craft a device tree with an invalid fixup offset property that causes an out-of-bounds read when processed.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide a malformed device tree blob to the vulnerable code, typically through system access or a boot-time exploit.
