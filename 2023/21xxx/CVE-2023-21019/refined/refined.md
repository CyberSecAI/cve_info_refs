```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from missing input validation in the p2p and SoftAp functions within the supplicant/hostapd AIDL implementation. Specifically, the code lacked checks for the length of MAC addresses and WPS device types.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to missing length checks for MAC addresses and WPS device type.",
    "Lack of input validation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read operation in the core supplicant/hostapd code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the p2p and SoftAp functions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide malicious input to the p2p or SoftAp functions that have not been validated."
