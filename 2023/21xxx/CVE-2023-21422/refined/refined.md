`SVE-2022-1931(CVE-2023-21422): Improper authorization vulnerability in WifiSevice`

This confirms that the content is related to CVE-2023-21422.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper authorization in the `semAddPublicDnsAddr` function within `WifiService`.

*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks when calling the `semAddPublicDnsAddr` API in `WifiService`. This allows unauthorized access to the function.

*   **Impact:** Attackers can set custom DNS servers without proper authorization. This could lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Hijacking:** Redirecting network traffic to malicious servers, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data theft.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting and manipulating network communication.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Disrupting network connectivity.

*   **Attack Vector:** Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability by binding to the `WifiService` without proper authorization, then calling the vulnerable `semAddPublicDnsAddr` function to set custom DNS servers.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * Local access to the device to bind the service.
    * No specific permissions needed to call the vulnerable API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected versions are Android 11 (R) and 12 (S).
*   The vulnerability was privately disclosed.
*   The fix involves adding a permission check logic when calling the service API.

In summary, CVE-2023-21422 is a moderate severity vulnerability that can allow local attackers to set custom DNS server without authorization by binding to WifiService and calling a vulnerable function. This could lead to a variety of network-based attacks.
