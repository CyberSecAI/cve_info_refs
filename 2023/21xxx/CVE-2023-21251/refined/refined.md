Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21251:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises when an activity enters Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode without a visible window. This could be exploited by a malicious app to block `onResume` completion, leaving the PiP window in an unresponsive state.
*   **Weakness:** The system did not properly handle the transition of an activity to PiP mode without a visible window, leading to a potential denial of service and UI unresponsiveness.
*   **Impact:** A malicious app could enter PiP without being visible to the user and block the `onResume` function, leading to an unresponsive PiP window that cannot be interacted with. This results in a denial-of-service scenario where the user can no longer use the affected activity, possibly with system-displayed text being hidden.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious application would trigger the vulnerable activity to enter PiP mode without a visible window.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would require the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the device. The malicious app would need to be able to cause the target activity to enter PiP mode without a visible window.

**Additional Details from the provided patches:**

* The vulnerability is addressed by preventing activities from entering PiP without a window and by sanitizing VpnDialog content to prevent HTML injection.

*  A malicious VPN app could potentially inject HTML tags and line breaks into the VPN label. This could be used to hide system-displayed text from the user, especially in the connection request dialog. By sanitizing the VPN label, this potential information hiding can be prevented. If a sanitization change is made, the package name of the VPN app will be shown instead.
