- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file.
