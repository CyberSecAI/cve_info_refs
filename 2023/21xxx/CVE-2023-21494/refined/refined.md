The provided content is related to CVE-2023-21494.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the auth API within `mm_Authentication.c` in the Shannon baseband. This issue stems from a lack of proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Potential buffer overflow due to improper input validation in `mm_Authentication.c` within the Shannon baseband.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability to cause invalid memory access which could lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation by sending crafted data to the affected device's baseband.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send network traffic or otherwise communicate with the vulnerable baseband.
- The attacker would need a way to send malicious or malformed data to trigger the buffer overflow, typically over the mobile network.
