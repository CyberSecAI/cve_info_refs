{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) client when handling server responses due to a missing length check before a memory copy operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Missing Length Check"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) without any required user interaction and without needing any additional execution privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted GATT server response that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow during the memory copy in `gatt_client_handle_server_rsp()` or `gatt_process_read_rsp()`.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to interact with the device's Bluetooth functionality and send a specially crafted GATT response."
