- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, which can occur when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to open a crafted file. The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N).
