{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the system compares app signing certificates before restoring backed-up permissions. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a failure to properly compare app signing certificates when restoring backed up permissions to apps.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of Privilege. A malicious app could potentially gain unauthorized permissions if the certificate check is bypassed.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious application could exploit the vulnerability during the backup and restore of app permissions.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would require the ability to create a malicious app and have control over the backup/restore process of application permissions."
