- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning a user must open a malicious file. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious file that the victim user opens using the vulnerable software.
