{
  "CVE-2023-21006": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling MAC addresses and WPS device types in wpa_supplicant/hostapd.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to sensitive information exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting vulnerabilities in wpa_supplicant/hostapd when processing MAC addresses and WPS device types during P2P and SoftAP connections.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the MAC address or WPS device type information being processed by the vulnerable functions in wpa_supplicant/hostapd. This might involve initiating or manipulating Wi-Fi connections. Specific capabilities would depend on the network configuration and access."
