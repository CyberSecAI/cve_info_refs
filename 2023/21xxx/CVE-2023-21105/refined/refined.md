Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21105:

**Verification:**

The provided commit log from android.googlesource.com clearly references "Bug: 261036568", which matches the bug ID A-261036568 associated with CVE-2023-21105 in the Android Security Bulletin. Therefore, this content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how share sheets handle previews of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Specifically, the share sheet was not preventing the previewing of potentially unknown or malicious URIs.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation or sanitization of URIs before displaying a preview within the share sheet. This allows potentially malicious URIs to be rendered.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: The security bulletin indicates this is an "Information Disclosure" (ID) vulnerability with "High" severity. This means an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by crafting a malicious URI that is then previewed via the share sheet. The bulletin does not specify what information might be disclosed, but it is likely to be related to the URI itself and how it's handled by the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URI and then use an app to trigger a share sheet which includes this URI. The share sheet would then attempt to preview the malicious URI, triggering the vulnerability. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to get a user to trigger a share sheet that contains the attacker's crafted URI. This may involve tricking a user into sharing a URI they receive via another app, web page, or other communication method. No special execution privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message from the code change states: "Prevent share sheet from previewing unowned URIs". This confirms that the fix was to prevent previews of URIs that aren't properly validated.
*   The provided code change is specifically within the `platform/frameworks/base` component, which deals with core Android framework functionalities.

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-21105 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Android framework, where the share sheet doesn't properly sanitize URIs before displaying a preview. An attacker could craft a malicious URI, tricking a user into sharing it, causing the share sheet to display a preview that could potentially reveal sensitive information related to the URI.
