Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `btm_ble_periodic_av_sync_lost` function, which internally calls `btm_ble_get_psync_index_from_handle`. The `btm_ble_get_psync_index_from_handle` function searches for a matching handle within an internal periodic sync buffer. If no matching handle is found, the function returns `MAX_SYNC_TRANSACTION`. However, the calling function `btm_ble_periodic_av_sync_lost` lacks a check for this `MAX_SYNC_TRANSACTION` return value. Consequently, it attempts to use this `MAX_SYNC_TRANSACTION` as an index to access the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to missing validation of the returned index from `btm_ble_get_psync_index_from_handle`.
- **Lack of input validation:** The calling function `btm_ble_periodic_av_sync_lost` fails to validate the index before accessing the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds memory access:** Exploitation leads to an out-of-bounds memory write. This can cause a variety of issues including a crash, unexpected behavior or possibly more serious consequences if exploitable.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The provided text classifies this as a critical RCE vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Bluetooth:** This vulnerability is specifically related to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) periodic advertising. An attacker could trigger this condition over Bluetooth by manipulating or causing sync loss events to occur such that a valid handle is not found during the lookup of the internal buffer

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Bluetooth proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to manipulate BLE:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Bluetooth stack of the target device to trigger the specific conditions that lead to a missing handle lookup.
- **No user interaction is required**: As noted in the 2023-06 Android Security Bulletin

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding handling for the `MAX_SYNC_TRANSACTION` case in the calling function.
- This issue was validated against a researcher Proof-of-Concept (POC)
