Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21102:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided text includes the commit message associated with the fix for bug `260821414`, which is directly linked to CVE-2023-21102 in the Android Security Bulletin. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability arises from the fact that the EFI runtime services workqueue is no longer the sole caller of `efi_call_virt_pointer()` in the kernel due to the introduction of PRMT in the ACPI subsystem.
   - This means that EFI runtime services lock is no longer sufficient to manage concurrent calls into firmware. Firmware calls may occur that are not marshaled via workqueue mechanism, but originate directly from the caller context. This leads to potential race conditions and insufficient stack space.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Race Condition:** Concurrent calls to EFI runtime services, not all of which are serialized by the workqueue, may lead to race conditions.
   - **Insufficient Stack Space:** The original stack used for EFI runtime services may not have enough space (8KB) as required by EFI spec. Calls outside the workqueue could potentially cause a stack overflow.
   - **Shadow Call Stack Manipulation:** Relocating the shadow call stack pointer from the regular stack could potentially produce a gadget to defeat it.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability could lead to local elevation of privilege.
   - **System Instability:** Stack overflows and race conditions can cause system instability or crashes.
   - **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the context of the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged by attackers to achieve code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device.
   - **Direct Call to EFI Runtime Services:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making direct calls to EFI runtime services outside the intended workqueue mechanism.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs local access to the device to trigger the vulnerable code path. No additional execution privileges are initially needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix introduces a spinlock-protected EFI runtime stack of 8KB. This dedicated stack ensures that runtime services have the required space and serializes access between the EFI workqueue and other callers of `efi_call_virt_pointer()`.
*   The fix also uses stack pivoting to avoid reloading the shadow call stack pointer from the regular stack, preventing a potential gadget to defeat it.
*   The commit also includes a fix for a missing include file (`asm/assembler.h`) related to the `ldr_l` macro.
