{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation or handling in the cpif component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges on the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed but it involves the cpif component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with or send malformed input to the cpif component. Specific required capabilities are not described but it's likely a local exploit."
