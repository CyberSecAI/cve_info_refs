{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks for admin user privileges within the Traceur app when developer options are enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest user could potentially open the Traceur app through a third-party application, and view system trace files, even when ADB debugging was disabled by the admin user. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious 3rd party app could attempt to open Traceur and view trace files on devices with developer options enabled, even if the current user is not an admin user"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need a malicious 3rd party app installed on the target device. The device would also need to have developer options enabled, and be running as a non-admin user"
