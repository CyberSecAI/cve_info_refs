- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software fails to properly validate input, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (UI:R). The attacker would need to provide a malicious input that exploits the improper validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file or document to trigger the vulnerability. This does not require any special privileges.
