  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SensorManager has a static map to store sensor manager instances. When a client requests an instance, it's stored in the map. However, if the client does not remove the instance using the new removeInstanceForPackage method, it will persist and could lead to a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to sensor manager instances not being properly removed from a static map."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak, potentially leading to resource exhaustion if many sensor manager instances are created and not removed.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious or buggy application could request a sensor manager instance and then not release it, leading to a memory leak.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to make requests to the SensorManager, which any application can do."
  },
  "fixes": [
    {
      "description": "Added removeInstanceForPackage method to SensorManager to allow clients to remove their sensor manager instances",
