- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). No privileges are needed (PR:N), but user interaction (UI:R) is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file.
