Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21142:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

   - The provided text includes CVE-2023-21142 in the "System" component section of the Android Security Bulletin for June 2023.
   - The associated commit message from android.googlesource.com clearly states the fix is to update "Traceur to check admin user status". This aligns with the general category of the vulnerability, which is an "ID" type (Information Disclosure).
   - Therefore, the content relates to CVE-2023-21142

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the Traceur app did not properly check for admin user privileges before allowing access to its trace files. This allows guest users to potentially access trace files, even when ADB debugging is disabled by the admin user.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - **Improper Authorization:** Traceur was not enforcing proper user privilege checks before granting access to potentially sensitive trace data.
     - **Information Disclosure:** This weakness leads to information disclosure, where guest users could potentially view system traces intended for debugging and potentially contain sensitive information.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     -  A guest user could potentially access system trace files through the Traceur app, even if ADB debugging was disabled by the administrator, and even if the user doesn't have admin privileges. This might lead to information disclosure of sensitive data.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a 3rd party app that opens Traceur, or directly opening Traceur to view trace files.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - An attacker would need to be a guest user on the device to exploit this vulnerability.
     - The attacker would need to have some method to start the Traceur app, or otherwise trigger the vulnerable code paths.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided commit message includes details not explicitly stated in the bulletin such as "This would previously be possible even when ADB debugging was disabled by the admin user".
- The commit message mentions that the fix listens for user changes and disables/enables trace access based on the new user's admin status.

In summary, the vulnerability (CVE-2023-21142) allows a guest user to potentially view system traces through the Traceur app due to inadequate privilege checks, even when ADB is disabled.
