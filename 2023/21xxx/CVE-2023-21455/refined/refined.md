The provided content is related to the specified CVE ID: CVE-2023-21455.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **Improper authorization implementation in Exynos baseband**. This means that the system is not correctly validating the authorization of actions in the Exynos baseband component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that the Exynos baseband is not properly verifying the authorization before performing certain actions. This can lead to unintended data processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions with incorrect handling of unencrypted messages. This could lead to the device processing data in an unintended and insecure way.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting the improper authorization within the Exynos baseband.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to send messages to the Exynos baseband, which suggests a remote attack vector if the baseband is reachable remotely, or possibly local through radio interfaces.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in "Select devices using Exynos CP chipsets".
*   The vulnerability was reported on November 12, 2022 and was fixed in the SMR Mar-2023 release.
*   The fix implemented adds proper authentication logic to the baseband to prevent the incorrect handling of unencrypted messages.
