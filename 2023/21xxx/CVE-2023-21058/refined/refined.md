{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in the cellular firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote code execution (RCE)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the cellular firmware.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to interact with or manipulate the cellular firmware, which is usually achieved through the mobile network connection or other forms of radio interface access. Specific details would depend on the nature of the vulnerability."
