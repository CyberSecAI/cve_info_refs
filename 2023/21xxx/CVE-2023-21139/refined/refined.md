Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21139:

**CVE-2023-21139**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in how `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` handles the creator UID. It fails to account for the PendingIntent creator's UID when performing component resolution. This can lead to incorrect results because explicit intents with non-matching intent filters can only be resolved if the sender has the same UID as the target component.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Incorrect component resolution: `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` doesn't properly check the UID of the PendingIntent creator, leading to potentially incorrect resolution results.
    *   Inconsistent intent resolution: Explicit intents with non-matching filters might be improperly resolved if the sender UID doesn't match the target, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) by potentially causing an application to behave in an unintended manner. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using a crafted `PendingIntent` where the component resolution via `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` is not correctly performed due to the UID check failure.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to create and send crafted `PendingIntent` objects and target an application that uses `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` to perform a component resolution.

**Summary of changes:**

The provided commit logs indicate fixes related to `ActivityIntentHelper` and `PendingIntent` handling:

1.  **ActivityIntentHelper Update:** The commit updates `ActivityIntentHelper` to directly use `PendingIntents`. It uses `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` to query components instead of relying on the intent contained within. This change was made to allow the package manager to correctly determine the identity to perform intent resolution.
2.  **PendingIntent Query Implementation:** The commit fixes how `PendingIntent.queryIntentComponents` is implemented. It now takes the PendingIntent's creator UID into account when performing component resolution, which prevents incorrect results due to missing UID checks.
3. **Intent Key Check**: The commit adds checks for key intents for selectors and prohibited flags.
4. **Media Click Action:** The commit uses PendingIntent for media click actions over the lockscreen to ensure proper handling of intents provided by apps as notification content.

These changes ensure that:
* The package manager can correctly determine the identity to perform intent resolution.
* `PendingIntent` queries correctly account for the creator UID, preventing incorrect component resolution.
* Media click actions on the lock screen use PendingIntent, fixing cases where the called activity might show over the lock screen.
These commits, collectively, address the vulnerability by ensuring that component resolution logic correctly considers the PendingIntent creator's identity and that the intended intent resolution is performed by the application.
