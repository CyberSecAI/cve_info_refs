- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software contains a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to application denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` indicates that the attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access (AV:L), no special privileges are required (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R).
