Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a scenario where the emergency dialer is opened from the lock screen using a gesture. During this brief period, `notificationPanelExpanded` is false and `occluded` is also false.  This combination can lead to `canStartSystemGesture` being true while `isKeyguardShowingOccluded` is false. This causes a fall-through into `OtherActivityInputConsumer`. In this state, the gesture stream can't be properly finished, because the Launcher never becomes visible as it is behind the lock screen. Consequently the recent animation is never finished.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Incorrect handling of the gesture stream when the emergency dialer is launched from the lock screen, leading to a state where the gesture stream cannot complete properly.
-  The issue lies in how `OtherActivityInputConsumer` handles input during the transition when the lock screen is present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The user experience is impacted because the gesture animation is not properly finished. The impact is likely limited to a denial of service in a way that the gesture animation is not finished properly, not preventing further use of device.
- Information disclosure (ID) is noted in the security bulletin. The information disclosure part is not clear from the content.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves opening the emergency dialer from the lock screen using a gesture.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a gesture on a locked Android device. There is no need for specific execution privileges
- Physical access to device is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message offers more details about the root cause, than the generic CVE description. It explains the conditions under which the gesture stream fails to complete.
- This vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure (ID) in the security bulletin, but the commit does not clarify any information disclosure, only a functional issue.
