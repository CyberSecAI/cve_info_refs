Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21017:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in `ParseParamsBlob` within the `libcodec2_hidl` library. Specifically, when parsing parameters, the code improperly accesses memory, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The code reads beyond the allocated memory boundary when parsing parameters. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as application crashes or, in more serious scenarios, information disclosure.
- Improper bounds checking: The code lacks proper bounds checking when reading parameter data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Elevation of privilege (EoP): Although the provided text mentions "Prevent OOB read," the Pixel Update Bulletin indicates that this vulnerability can lead to "Elevation of Privilege". This indicates that an attacker may be able to leverage this out-of-bounds read to execute code or bypass security restrictions.
- Information Disclosure: While not explicitly stated in the provided commit message, out-of-bounds reads can potentially disclose sensitive information from the device's memory.

**Attack vectors:**

- Processing malformed parameter data: The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted or malformed parameter data by `libcodec2_hidl`. An attacker could provide such malformed data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Ability to provide malformed data: The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence the parameter data processed by the vulnerable code. This could potentially involve exploiting another vulnerability or having a privileged position on the system.
- Code execution context:  An attacker may need to control a component or process that calls the vulnerable `ParseParamsBlob` function in `libcodec2_hidl`.
