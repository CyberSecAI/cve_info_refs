  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2023-21010",
      "description": "The provided text indicates that a vulnerability exists due to a missing sanity check for MAC address length and WPS device type length in the supplicant/hostapd AILD implementation. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the `setWpsDeviceType()` function and p2p and SoftAp functions in supplicant/hostapd code. This could lead to out-of-bounds read operations in core supplicant/hostapd code.",
      "root_cause": "Missing sanity checks for the length of MAC addresses and WPS device types in `setWpsDeviceType()` and p2p/SoftAp functions within the supplicant/hostapd AILD implementation.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
         "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read operation, possibly leading to information disclosure or denial-of-service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the P2P and SoftAp functionalities or via `setWpsDeviceType` calls within the supplicant/hostapd implementation.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to interact with the P2P, SoftAp functionalities, or the `setWpsDeviceType` function within the scope of the vulnerable code to trigger this vulnerability."
