Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks when starting instrumentations, specifically when the initial instrumentation is started from the shell (SHELL) and then chains into other instrumentations. If an instrumentation started from the shell initiates another one and so on, all Context#startInstrumentation calls in the chain would be allowed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Permission Check:** There's a lack of proper validation to ensure instrumentations started from the shell don't improperly chain into starting other instrumentations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** This vulnerability allows for an elevation of privilege. A local attacker can bypass restrictions on starting instrumentations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** An attacker with local access and the ability to execute commands in the shell can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Chaining Instrumentations:** The exploit relies on the ability to start an instrumentation from the shell, and then use that instrumentation to start other instrumentations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Shell Access:** The attacker needs shell access on the device.
- **Ability to Start Instrumentations:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate instrumentations, specifically those that can then chain to other instrumentations.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit message specifically notes: "DO NOT MERGE: Context#startInstrumentation could be started from SHELL only now". The fix restricts usage to only shell and also includes an exception thrown if this is abused.
- The fix enforces a check to avoid the case where an instrumentation started from shell starts another one and so on, which leads to a privilege escalation
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 11, 12, 12L, and 13.
