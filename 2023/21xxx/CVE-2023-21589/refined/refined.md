Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-21589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, meaning the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's system, gaining control or causing further damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), which implies that the attacker needs to have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability, likely through a malicious file.
*   The user interaction is required (UI:R), indicating a user must perform some action such as opening a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a method to get a malicious file to the target machine and must trick a user into opening it. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
*   The attacker requires no special privileges (PR:N).
*   The vulnerability exists within a single application (S:U)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates this vulnerability is present in Adobe InDesign versions ID18.0 and earlier, and ID17.4 and earlier, on both Windows and macOS.
*   The provided CVSS score is 7.8 and is considered "Critical".
*   The fix is to update InDesign to version ID18.1 or ID17.4.1.
*   The same researcher was credited for discovering this vulnerability as well as CVE-2023-21587, CVE-2023-21588, CVE-2023-21590, CVE-2023-21591, and CVE-2023-21592.
