{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper length checks on MAC addresses and WPS device types in the supplicant/hostapd implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read operation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially trigger out-of-bounds read operations in the core supplicant/hostapd code, leading to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the wpa_supplicant_8 component, specifically in the handling of MAC addresses and WPS device types, which are used in P2P and SoftAp functionalities.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to influence or control the MAC address and/or WPS device type during the P2P or SoftAp connection process to trigger the out of bounds read."
