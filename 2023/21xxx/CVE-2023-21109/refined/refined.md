Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper size checks when parsing AccessibilityServiceInfo objects from XML or when a service attempts to update its own information. If the parsed/updated AccessibilityServiceInfo object is excessively large, it leads to an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Size Validation:** The core weakness is the absence of proper size limits when handling `AccessibilityServiceInfo` objects. This allows a malicious or crafted object to exceed the expected size during parsing and updating.
- **Lack of Handling Large Objects:** The system does not properly handle cases where the `AccessibilityServiceInfo` object is too large, leading to an error being thrown.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Although the CVE description states local escalation of privilege with user interaction, the provided text doesn't clearly elaborate on how this is achieved through the size check bypass. It only specifies that the vulnerability could lead to EoP. The text mentions that an error is thrown when the object is too large, implying some disruption may be expected during exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Parsing Malicious XML:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file containing an oversized `AccessibilityServiceInfo` object during parsing.
- **Service Update:** A compromised or malicious accessibility service could attempt to update its own `AccessibilityServiceInfo` with an oversized object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to either cause parsing of a crafted XML file or be able to execute code as an accessibility service to update its info.
- **User Interaction (according to CVE, but not clear from the provided text):** The official CVE description mentions user interaction being required for exploitation. However the provided content from the commit logs doesn't add further clarity to this requirement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit logs mention "skipping" the service when parsing too large XML, and throwing an error if a service attempts to update with too large info, which can be inferred that this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-21109 is caused by a missing size check on `AccessibilityServiceInfo` objects during parsing from XML or updating a service's own info. This can be exploited by providing a large object that leads to an error. The CVE description indicates that it can lead to local EoP with user interaction. The provided commit log doesn't specify how this can lead to privilege escalation, it implies that there might be a possibility for denial of service.
