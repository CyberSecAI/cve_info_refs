Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21247:

**CVE-2023-21247**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of location settings within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning preferences pages. When the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` setting is enabled, the location service's MainSwitchPreference pages for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning are incorrectly made unavailable. This is to prevent intent-based direct access and enforce location policy transparency.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is an **Elevation of Privilege (EoP)** issue, allowing an attacker to bypass intended location access restrictions. It appears that these pages are not correctly made unavailable when the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` is set, leading to unexpected access behavior.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass location setting restrictions by directly accessing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning pages through intents. This could lead to unauthorized access of location data, potentially impacting user privacy.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves leveraging intent-based direct access to the MainSwitchPreference pages for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning when `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` should have disabled them.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to send specific intents to launch these settings pages. The attacker does not require special privileges or permissions.

**Summary**
The vulnerability lies in the settings application not correctly enforcing a restriction on the location settings for Bluetooth and WiFi scanning, allowing for unintended access. This vulnerability allows for elevation of privileges by bypassing intended security measures by directly accessing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning settings pages.
