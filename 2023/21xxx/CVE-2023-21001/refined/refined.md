Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21001:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists within the Settings app, specifically related to the "Modify" popup menu for network providers. It appears that the "Modify" context menu was being added even when the user was not an admin, which should not be the case.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** This vulnerability allows a non-admin user to potentially access or modify settings that are intended for administrators only.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A non-admin user could potentially modify network provider settings by accessing the context menu, which could lead to unintended network changes.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker needs to be a non-admin user of an Android device with the vulnerable Settings app.
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by navigating to network provider settings and attempting to access the "Modify" context menu.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have a user account on the target Android device.
- The attacker does not require root access.
- The attacker must have access to the settings menu.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is fixed by removing the "Modify" menu if the user is not an admin.
