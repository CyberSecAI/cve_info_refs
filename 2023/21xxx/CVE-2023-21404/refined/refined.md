- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A static RSA key was used to encrypt Axis-specific source code in legacy LUA components. This practice does not follow Axis secure development best practices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a static RSA key for encryption. While the encryption is intended to obfuscate code, the static key renders it ineffective.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability does not directly lead to compromise of devices or customer data as the encrypted code is non-sensitive.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is related to the static RSA key used in LUA components. The content doesn't describe any direct attack vector, but the vulnerability can be exploited by obtaining the static key which can then be used to decrypt the source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to obtain the static RSA key to decrypt the source code.
