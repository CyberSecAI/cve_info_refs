•  AXIS OS 11.0.X - 11.3.x

Summary

Alexander Pick, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found a flaw that does not
follow Axis secure development best practices. A static RSA key was used to encrypt Axis-specific
source code in legacy LUA-components. The encryption was applied to avoid non sensitive Axis-
specific code from being easily human readable. The encryption using a static RSA key is not
necessary since it is neither protecting sensitive data, nor can it be used to compromise Axis
devices or customer data.

The vulnerability has been assigned a 4.1 (Medium) severity by using the CVSSv3.1 scoring
system. Learn more about the Common Vulnerability Scoring System here.

Solution & Mitigation

Axis has released a patched version of AXIS OS (version 11.4.52) that removes the LUA-
component. No patch will be made available for the long-term support (LTS) tracks as the LUA-
components cannot be removed due to backwards compatibility reasons. Since the static RSA key
is not protecting sensitive data, a non-patched AXIS OS version does not imply any practical risk.

The release notes will state the following:
Corrected CVE-2023-21404. For more information, please visit the Axis vulnerability management portal.
