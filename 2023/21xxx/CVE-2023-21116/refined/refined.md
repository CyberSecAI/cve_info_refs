Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue related to the number of shortcuts that an app can retain within the system. When an app sends a large amount of conversion shortcuts, the system may cache a high number of them, potentially causing system health issues. A previous attempt to fix this by throwing an exception when the limit was reached caused apps to crash, as apps sending large amounts of shortcuts have no way to know how many are cached by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper shortcut management:** The system did not effectively limit the total number of shortcuts an application could retain.
*   **Improper exception handling:** The initial fix that threw an exception upon reaching the limit resulted in app crashes, which is not a graceful way to handle the issue.
*   **Re-publishing of removed shortcuts:** Previously removed shortcuts that were still retained by the system could be re-published, leading to the total number of shortcuts exceeding the limit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System instability:** An application could publish a large number of shortcuts, leading to potential system health issues due to excessive resource consumption.
*   **App crashes:** If an exception was thrown due to reaching the limit, the application would crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker-controlled application could publish a large number of shortcuts.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered locally, as apps can publish shortcuts via API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to install an app on the affected Android device.
*   The attacker app needs to be able to publish shortcuts via API.

**Additional Information:**

The provided commit messages detail the fix, which limits the number of cached shortcuts and prevents app crashes. The fix now proactively removes excessive shortcuts to avoid crashes. Cached shortcuts are removed first, followed by dynamic shortcuts. The fix also addresses an unexpected flow where re-publishing previously removed shortcuts could cause the total number to exceed the set limit.

The Android Security Bulletin for May 2023 also mentions CVE-2023-21116 as a "Moderate" severity "Elevation of Privilege" vulnerability that requires user interaction and includes the relevant AOSP commit links.

The vulnerability affects Android versions 11, 12, 12L, and 13.
