  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the `add_hashtree_footer` function processes file system types when the `avb_hash_algorithm` property is set, potentially leading to an elevation of privilege.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of file system types with the `avb_hash_algorithm` property.",
        "Potential for privilege escalation."

      "impact": "Elevation of privilege.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited during the build process when the `avb_hash_algorithm` property is set for specific file system types.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to influence the build process, particularly in how the `avb_hash_algorithm` property is used when building target file systems. This would likely involve controlling the build environment or configuration."
