      "cve": "CVE-2023-21030",
      "description": "The commit message \"keystore: Fix double ownership of ConfirmationListener\" indicates a vulnerability related to double ownership of ConfirmationListener objects, which leads to memory errors. Specifically, using std::make_shared with ndk::SharedRefBase objects can cause memory corruption.",
      "root_cause": "Using std::make_shared with ndk::SharedRefBase objects causes memory errors due to double ownership.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Double ownership of ConfirmationListener objects.",
        "Memory corruption due to incorrect usage of std::make_shared with ndk::SharedRefBase."
      ],
      "impact": "Memory errors and potential crashes or unexpected behavior due to memory corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would likely involve manipulating the system to trigger the vulnerable code path in the keystore service.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the keystore service in a way that triggers the double ownership issue. This may require some level of privilege or a specific usage scenario of the confirmation listener."
