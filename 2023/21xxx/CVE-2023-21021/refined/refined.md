Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Wi-Fi module handles permission checks when a Guest user attempts to add a new network. Specifically, a Guest user with the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission was able to bypass the required permission check for adding a network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Permission Check:** The core issue is the failure to properly enforce the necessary permissions for network addition when a Guest user has the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission. This indicates a logical flaw in the permission handling logic within the Wi-Fi module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A Guest user with the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission can bypass the add network permission check. This allows the guest user to potentially configure network settings, which could lead to further unauthorized access or actions within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be a Guest user on the device and have the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Account:** The attacker must have a guest user account on the Android device.
*   **`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` Permission:** The guest user must have been granted the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit message from `android.googlesource.com` confirms the vulnerability and describes the fix:

*   **Commit Message:** "Don't allow Guest user to bypass permission check. Fix an issue where Guest can bypass addNetwork permission check with SYSTEM\_ALERT\_WINDOW permission."
*   **Bug ID:** 255537598
*   **Fix:** The commit modifies the permission check logic within the Wi-Fi module to properly prevent the bypass.

This vulnerability is listed in the "Pixel Update Bulletinâ€”March 2023" under the "System" component as an "Elevation of Privilege" vulnerability with a "Moderate" severity.
