{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation within the libril_sitril component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege (EoP) due to a lack of proper input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the libril_sitril component, suggesting a local attack vector through interaction with the radio interface layer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need the ability to interact with the radio interface layer, likely requiring a compromised app or local access."
