Based on the provided information, this issue report relates to a crash in Virtuoso 7.2.9. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The crash occurs within the `sch_name_to_object` function, triggered by a specific sequence of SQL commands. The root cause is likely related to how Virtuoso handles updates on views that reference the same table, leading to a deep recursion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Recursive view update:** The vulnerability stems from the interaction between `CREATE VIEW` and `UPDATE` statements. When a view is created based on a table and then updated, and that update might further trigger the view to re-evaluate and potentially update the table again. This can cause a loop and potentially a stack overflow due to excessive recursion, which in this case leads to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash of the Virtuoso database server leads to a denial of service, making the database unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting the specific SQL statements (`CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VIEW`, `UPDATE`) into the database server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   An attacker needs to have the ability to execute SQL commands on the Virtuoso database server, which usually means having some level of authenticated access.

**More details than the CVE description:**

- The issue report provides a concrete Proof of Concept (PoC) SQL code that triggers the crash. The backtrace shows the recursive function calls leading to the crash which involves  `sch_name_to_object`, `sqlc_update_searched`, and `sqlc_update_view` functions. The report provides steps to reproduce the crash using docker. It also mentions that this is fixed by the same patch as issue #1118.
