NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability where, when it is launched with the non-default command line option --model-control explicit, an attacker may use the model load API to cause a relative path traversal. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.
