Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-31408:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the cleartext storage of sensitive information within the SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR. User credentials, specifically, are stored in the browser's local storage without proper encryption or obfuscation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-312:** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
- The vulnerability lies in the way the SICK FTMg stores user credentials, making them easily accessible.
- The vulnerability is exposed to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the theft of user credentials.
- The impact is primarily on confidentiality, as stolen credentials could be used for unauthorized access.
- The availability is impacted with a LOW score.
- The integrity of the data is not directly impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The attacker uses XSS to access the user's browser's local storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** No prior privileges or access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a XSS attack in order to steal the stored credentials.
-  An attacker must have network access to the device.

**Affected Products:**
- SICK FTMg AIR FLOW SENSOR with part numbers: 1100214, 1100215, 1100216, 1120114, 1120116, 1122524, and 1122526.
- This affects the following specific products with Firmware versions <v2.x :
    - SICK FTMG-ESD15AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR
    - SICK FTMG-ESD20AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR
    - SICK FTMG-ESD25AXX AIR FLOW SENSOR
