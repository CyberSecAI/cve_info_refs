# DMTF-2023-0001: SPDM mutual authentication bypass

Critical

[jyao1](/jyao1)
published
GHSA-qw76-4v8p-xq9f
May 2, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.3.1

## Patched versions

2.3.2

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session establishment.

If a device supports both DHE session and PSK session with mutual

authentication, the attacker may be able to establish the session with

KEY\_EXCHANGE and PSK\_FINISH to bypass the mutual authentication. This

is most likely to happen when the Requester begins a session using

one method (DHE, for example) and then uses the other method's finish

(PSK\_FINISH in this example) to establish the session. The session

hashes would be expected to fail in this case, but the condition was

not detected.

Impacted Function:

This issue only impacts the SPDM responder, which supports KEY\_EX\_CAP=1 and

PSK\_CAP=10b at same time with mutual authentication requirement.

The SPDM requester is not impacted.

The SPDM responder is not impacted if KEY\_EX\_CAP=0 or PSK\_CAP=0 or PSK\_CAP=01b.

The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual authentication is not required.

Impacted Branch:

libspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are all impacted.

Other Important Notes:

The SPDM specification (DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.

### Patches

libspdm main: [#2006](https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/pull/2006)

libspdm 2.3: [#2007](https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/pull/2007)

Because libspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 have known function detect, they are not maintained.

libspdm 2.3 branch users should upgrade to release 2.3.2.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
