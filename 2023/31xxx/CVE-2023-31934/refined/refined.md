{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application stores user-provided input (admin name) into the database without proper sanitization or encoding, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the 'adminname' parameter before storing it in the database. It also displays this unsanitized data on other pages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'admin name' field. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the admin profile or other pages where the admin name is displayed. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with administrative access can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Admin Name' field of the admin profile page (`http://localhost/rpms/admin/admin-profile.php`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the admin profile page and modify the 'Admin Name' field."
