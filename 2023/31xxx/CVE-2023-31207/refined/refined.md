- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The automation user's secret was being logged in the Apache access log file when generating performance graph diagnostics.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Logging of sensitive information (automation user credentials) in the Apache access log.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of the automation user's secret, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the Checkmk system.
- **Attack vectors:** Creating a support diagnostic report, either via the GUI or command line, while including the "Performance Graphs of Checkmk Server" option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the Apache access log file on the Checkmk server. The attacker needs to be able to read log files on the system with the vulnerability.
