Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control in the "Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields" WordPress plugin. Specifically, there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, enabling unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user could perform actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact would vary based on the vulnerable functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by any unprivileged user who has access to the vulnerable functionality. This is likely via the WordPress frontend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user (e.g., a contributor) on the WordPress site. No additional capabilities or specific positions are mentioned beyond this.
