Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-31566.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an object ownership issue involving `PdfEncrypt` members in different classes, specifically `PdfParser`, `PdfParserObject`, and `PdfMemDocument`. The `PdfParser` creates a `PdfEncrypt` object. Then a pointer to this object is passed to `PdfParserObject`. `PdfMemDocument` then takes ownership of the same `PdfEncrypt` object through `TakeEncrypt`, which deletes the unique pointer in `PdfParser`. However, the `PdfParserObject` is still using the pointer to the deleted memory. This results in use-after-free when the `PdfParserObject` attempts to access the `PdfEncrypt` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free vulnerability in `PoDoFo::PdfEncrypt::IsMetadataEncrypted()`.
- Incorrect management of `PdfEncrypt` object ownership across different classes.
- The `PdfParserObject` was holding a raw pointer to an object that was managed by a unique pointer elsewhere.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a heap-use-after-free error.
- The specific impact is when the document's metadata is encrypted, and the application tries to access the metadata.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted PDF file with specific encryption settings.
- The PoDoFo library is used with the `podofoencrypt` tool, using the `-rc4v2` option, a user password, and output file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker can trigger this vulnerability by using the podofoencrypt tool with specific command-line arguments targeting an input PDF file.
