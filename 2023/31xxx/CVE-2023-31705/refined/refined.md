Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `page` parameter of the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the `page` parameter.
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization on the `page` parameter allows injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Cookie stealing.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the attacker's objectives.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `page` parameter.
- The malicious script is reflected back from the server and executed within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Task Reminder System.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload within the `page` parameter.
- The attacker needs to entice a victim to visit the crafted URL. This can be done by techniques such as sending a phishing email, or embedding the link on a third party website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is in the format `http://localhost/php-trs/admin/?page=<malicious_payload>&id=10`.
- The provided proof-of-concept payload is `reminders%2Fmanage_reminder28988'%3Balert(1)%2F%2F689` which will cause an alert box to display on the page.
- The vulnerable component is the "page parameter" in the admin section of the application, located at `/php-trs/admin/`.
- The affected product is "Task Reminder System" version 1.0 by Sourcecodester.
