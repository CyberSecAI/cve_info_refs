Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Repetier Server as described by CYBIR:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation allows attackers to include arbitrary files by manipulating the URL path. The application integrates attacker controlled input without sanitizing it.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP GET request to `/views..%5c..%5c..%5c...` etc. to traverse the file system.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files such as configuration files, password files, SQL database files (e.g., `user.sql` containing password hashes and API keys), and potentially gain code execution.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests.
    *   **Additional Notes:** The server process runs with SYSTEM privileges, exacerbating the impact.

2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) & Host Header Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing CSRF protection mechanisms and insufficient validation of the Host header.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of anti-CSRF tokens, and not checking the origin of requests. Lack of proper validation of the Host header.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP requests with a manipulated Host header, or crafted requests to trick users into performing actions they did not intend.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can trick a user into performing actions, intercept traffic, steal sensitive information, bypass firewall rules, and deliver attack code.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests.

3.  **Plaintext Transmission of Passwords:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Passwords are sent over HTTP using the GET method.
    *   **Weakness:** Transmitting passwords in the URL via HTTP GET is insecure, as it's sent in clear text and can be intercepted.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Interception of network traffic, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can easily intercept and steal passwords, leading to account compromise.
    *    **Required Capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic.

4.  **Missing XSS Filtering Headers and Sanitization Controls**
    *  **Root Cause:** Lack of proper XSS filtering headers and sanitization.
    *  **Weakness:** Missing XSS filter headers and sanitization of user-controlled input.
    * **Attack Vector**: Undisclosed vectors, potentially through user-provided input.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *    **Required Capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious content.

**Summary of Impact:**

The combination of these vulnerabilities allows for:

*   Complete compromise of the server and operating system through LFI and elevated privileges.
*   Theft of sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys).
*   Potential for further attacks due to lack of CSRF protection and host header injection.
*   Exposure of users to credential theft due to clear text transmission of passwords and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Affected Versions:**

The article specifically mentions Repetier Server version **<=v.1.4.10** as vulnerable. The latest version available for download on the official website is 1.4.18.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report highlights that the Repetier Server service executes with SYSTEM privileges, which amplifies the impact of the LFI vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities are described with proof-of-concept (PoC) examples.
