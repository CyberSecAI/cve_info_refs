- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, with the additional risk of bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser session. This enables attackers to steal sensitive information (login credentials, personal data), perform unauthorized actions on the victim's behalf (modifying or deleting data), and achieve account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based, requiring a user to interact with the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link that, when clicked by the victim, executes the attacker's injected code. The attacker does not need any prior privileges.
