Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Sage X3 web application dynamically builds pages using user-supplied inputs. These inputs are not properly validated or filtered, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the injected malicious code, and it is executed when other users view the affected page.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user inputs before using them to generate web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, enabling actions like:
    *   Stealing usernames and passwords
    *   Modifying page content
    *   Redirecting to malicious authentication forms to steal credentials
    *   Redirecting to malware-hosting websites
    *   Undermining brand image

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated User Injection:** A common user account can inject malicious code which targets an administrator.
*   **Administrator Injection:** Malicious users with administrative privileges can inject code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid account to log in to the Sage X3 application, with either common user or administrator privileges, depending on the specific injection point being exploited.
*   For the main injection point described, an attacker with a regular user account can target an administrator. Other injection points require administrative access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory specifically mentions that the vulnerability was tested on Sage X3 version 12.14.0.50-0 but may also affect other builds.
*   A patch is available to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Maxime Dupuis and Romain Delaunay from DIGITEMIS CYBERSECURITY & PRIVACY.
*   The advisory includes a timeline for the discovery, reporting, and disclosure of the vulnerability.
