2. CREDITS
============================
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Maxime Dupuis and Romain Delaunay from DIGITEMIS CYBERSECURITY & PRIVACY.
3. VERSION AFFECTED
============================
Sage X3 - release/12.14.0 build 50 of 2022-01-24, only tested on this build, more builds might by affected.
4. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
============================
Some parts of the Web application "Sage X3" are dynamically built using user's inputs. Yet, those inputs are not verified nor filtered by the application, so they mathed the expected format.
Therefore, when HTML/JavaScript code is injected into those fields, this code will be saved by the application and executed by the web browser of the user viewing the web page.
Several injection points have been identified on the application.
The major one requires the user to be authenticated with a common account, he can then target an Administrator.
All others endpoints need the malicious user to be authenticated as an Administrator. Therefore, the impact is diminished.

Exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can do numerous malicious actions in the web browser of the victim, such as :
- Steal usernames and passwords of the user (depending on the configuration of the browser);
- Modify the look and contents of the page for the browser of the victim;
- Redirect the user to a malicious authentication form, to steal their credentials;
- Redirect the users to a malicious website hosting malware, in order to take over the victim's computer (exploit-kit);
- Undermine brand's image of Sage or his customer.
