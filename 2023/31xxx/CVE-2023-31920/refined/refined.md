The provided content relates to a bug report for JerryScript, a lightweight JavaScript engine. The issue involves a failed assertion during the execution of a specific JavaScript code snippet. Although this issue might have security implications, the provided information focuses on the bug itself rather than a specific vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the issue is a failed assertion within the `vm_loop` function in `jerry-core/vm/vm.c`. Specifically, the assertion `ecma_find_named_property (func_obj_p, ecma_get_magic_string (LIT_MAGIC_STRING_NAME)) == NULL` fails. This indicates that the code is attempting to find a property that is unexpectedly present when it should not exist. The issue seems to be triggered by a specific way of defining classes with computed property names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The content describes a failed assertion and an abnormal program termination. While not explicitly described, this could be a sign of a use-after-free, heap overflow or some other type of memory corruption vulnerability. The specific assertion failure points to a potential issue with the engine's property management logic, which may be vulnerable to memory corruption. It is related to how the engine handles properties of classes with computed names.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The direct impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to the program aborting because of the failed assertion. Further exploitation could potentially lead to memory corruption, which may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through the execution of a crafted JavaScript code, specifically using computed property names in class definitions, which triggers the assertion failure within JerryScript's core.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs the capability to execute Javascript code within the context of a vulnerable JerryScript engine.
