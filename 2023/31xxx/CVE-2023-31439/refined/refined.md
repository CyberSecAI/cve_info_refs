{
  "CVE-2023-31439": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in systemd 253. An attacker can modify the contents of past events in a sealed log file and then adjust the file such that checking the integrity shows no error, despite modifications.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the verification process of forward secure log sealing. The verification process doesn't check if old entries are sealed with the key corresponding to their epoch and not a more recent one.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The verification process lacks a crucial check on the epoch of the key used for sealing log entries."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can modify past log entries, reseal them with a current key, and bypass the verification process, making it seem as if the logs are unmodified and valid.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attack involves modifying sealed log entries and resealing them with a current key."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to modify the log files and must have access to a current key used for sealing."
  }
