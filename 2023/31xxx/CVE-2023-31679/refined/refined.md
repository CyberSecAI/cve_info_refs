Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an *Incorrect Access Control* issue in the com.videogo application, version 6.8.1. Specifically, the application uses the device ID in requests to obtain alarm information. The server then includes the alarm image URL in the response. However, the application does not properly validate the device ID included in the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The primary vulnerability is an insecure direct object reference. By manipulating the device ID in the request, an attacker can obtain the image URL associated with a different device, which they are not authorized to access.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The server does not perform adequate authorization checks to ensure that the user making the request is entitled to view alarm images associated with the specified device ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Alarm Images:** By changing the device ID in the request, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to alarm images of other devices, potentially exposing sensitive or private information.
*   **Privacy Breach:** This unauthorized access can lead to a significant privacy breach as attackers can view images from camera feeds that they do not have permission to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulated API Request:** The attacker manipulates the API request by altering the device ID parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the network requests made by the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding API Structure:** The attacker must understand the API structure of the vulnerable application to be able to manipulate the parameters in the request. Specifically, to know how to modify the device ID within the request.
*   **Knowledge of Device ID format/structure (possibly):** It is implied that the attacker should know the format or be able to guess/enumerate device IDs that exist to use them in the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is described as recurring on Android 7.0 and above.
*   The provided images in the document illustrate the vulnerability by showing the request, the response, the changed device id, and the unauthorized image access.
