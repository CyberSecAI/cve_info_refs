Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31191

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver is vulnerable to information loss due to its processing of injected, high-power spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages. Specifically, the receiver prioritizes processing these spoofed messages over real Remote ID (RID) information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of high-power spoofed ODID messages.
- Vulnerability in the message processing logic, where spoofed high-power messages are prioritized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Loss:** The primary impact is the loss of real Remote ID (RID) information. The receiver will drop legitimate RID messages.
- **Data Manipulation:** The receiver will generate and transmit JSON-encoded MQTT messages containing the crafted, spoofed RID information. This could lead to misleading data about drone locations and identities.
- **Impact on Integrity and Availability:** The vulnerability affects the integrity of the information provided by the device, and potentially impacting availability of correct information by flooding the system with manipulated information

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Traffic Injection:** The attack vector is the injection of high-power spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages on specific channels.
- **Adjacent network:** Since this is a wireless protocol, the attacker needs to be within range of the sensor, and be able to transmit on the appropriate channels to inject the malicious messages

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the DroneScout ds230 receiver.
- **Transmission Capability:** The attacker needs to have the ability to transmit high-power spoofed ODID messages on the channels the device is listening on
- **Knowledge of target frequencies and protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft valid messages for the ODID protocol, as well as transmit on the correct frequencies

**Affected Versions:**
- DroneScout ds230 firmware versions from 20230104-1650 to 20230329-1042

**Solution:**
- Update to a firmware version newer than 20230329-1042

**CVSS Score:**
- 9.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as an information loss vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was identified by Nicol√≤ Facchi of Nozomi Networks.
- The vendor, BlueMark Innovations, released a patch in the version released after 20230329-1042
