Vendor description:
-------------------
Serenity Software is a software vendor that distributes the Serenity Platform.
"Serenity is an ASP.NET Core / TypeScript application platform designed to
simplify and shorten development of data-centric business applications with
a service based architecture."

Source: <https://github.com/serenity-is>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends Serenity users to install the latest update and review
the vendor's changelog for further information.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals
is highly advised, as the software may be affected from other security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Arbitrary File Upload to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2023-31285)
The application allows users to upload profile pictures for users.
It was identified that an attacker has the possibility to upload
arbitrary malicious files. Although some specific file endings are
not allowed, it is still possible to upload files without an extension.

It was possible to:
• Upload malicious HTML files that will infect the user's browser with malicious
   JavaScript. As a result, the user's DOM is fully compromised.
• Upload malware that will infect the user's operating system upon download and
   local execution.

Note:
Although the option for uploading new profile pictures is only visible to power users,
users with lower privileges can still trigger the upload functionality.

2) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-31286)
It is possible to collect valid email addresses by interacting with the
"forgot password" function of the application. This vulnerability is
useful to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks. If the email
address is known, it is easier to find the corresponding password.

3) Reusable Password Reset Tokens (CVE-2023-31287)
The web application provides the possibility to reset the password via
email. The corresponding email contains a password reset link which includes
a user-specific token. When visiting the link, the user can set a new
password for this account. After changing the password, the password reset link
remains valid (3 hours) and can be used a second time to change the password
of the user.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Arbitrary File Upload to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2023-31285)
A user can upload arbitrary files to the server, but some file extensions
like .aspx are not allowed. Nevertheless, malicious files like Word documents
with enabled macros or other executable malware can be uploaded. There also
seems to be no anti-virus scan enabled for these files, as it is possible to
upload the EICAR test file which is flagged as malicious by all antivirus
software.

Additionally, it is also possible to attack a privileged power user, by
generating a malicious HTML page, that on visit escalates the role of the
attacker user. This is possible, because the file is uploaded to the same
domain and therefore the containing JavaScript executes in the same context as
the application. The impact of this vulnerability is therefore equal to that
of a stored XSS vulnerability.

To upload a malicious HTML file an authenticated user without the role of a
power user can send the following request:
--------------------------------------------------
POST /File/TemporaryUpload HTTP/2
Host: demo.serenity.is
Cookie: [...]
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--boundary
Origin: <https://demo.serenity.is>
[...]

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Serenity_ImageUploadEditor31[]"; filename="test.html"
Content-Type: image/png

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1>SEC Consult</h1>
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
</body>
</html>
--boundary--
--------------------------------------------------

The response reveals the path of the uploaded file:
--------------------------------------------------
HTTP/2 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: application/json
[...]

{
     "TemporaryFile":"temporary/f3c960aca7724409a3c4c6e597ce5b92.html",
     "Size":110,
     "IsImage":false,
     "Width":0,
     "Height":0
}
--------------------------------------------------

The uploaded file can then be found under /upload/temporary/f3c960aca7724409a3c4c6e597ce5b92.html.

The final link will look benign thus it is possible to attack administrator
users and escalate the privileges of the own user.

2) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-31286)
The "forgot password" page lets users request a new password reset mail.
They need to enter their email address which corresponds to their account
and receive a mail containing a link to reset their password. Unfortunately,
the response of this request leaks if a user with the provided email address
exists or not. If an attacker wants to check if a user account with a
specific email exists, he can send the following request:

--------------------------------------------------
POST /Account/ForgotPassword HTTP/2
Host: demo.serenity.is
Origin: <https://demo.serenity.is>
Content-Type: application/json
[...]

{
     "Email":"emailToCheck () sec-consult com"
}
--------------------------------------------------

If the user with this mail does not exist, the response will look like this:
--------------------------------------------------
HTTP/2 400 Bad Request
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: application/json

{
     "Error": {
         "Code":"CantFindUserWithEmail",
         "Message":"Can't find a user with that e-mail adress!"
     }
}
--------------------------------------------------

If the user with this mail address does exist, the response will look like
this:
--------------------------------------------------
HTTP/2 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: application/json
[...]

{}
--------------------------------------------------

3) Reusable Password Reset Tokens (CVE-2023-31287)
When resetting the password via the "forgot password" functionality on the
login screen, an email containing a password reset link is sent to the user.
When clicking on this link, a user can choose a new password for his account.
However, after changing the password to a new one, the password reset link
remains valid. It can be used a second time to update the user's password
although it was already changed. If an attacker gets access to the browser
history of the user, he can change the password of the user's account and
access it afterwards.

-----------------------------
The following versions are affected:
< 6.7.0

|  |  | ## 6.7.0 (2023-04-06) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Features: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - \*\*[WARNING!]\*\* This release focuses on addressing potential security issues that were recently discovered by Fabian Densborn from SEC Consult. Serene/StartSharp users must either create a new project from the 6.7.0+ template or manually apply the relevant changes from this commit to their existing applications after updating Serenity packages to 6.7.0+: https://github.com/serenity-is/serene/commit/6dce8162f4382badd429a9f0f1470acb64e8c4fd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Serenity.is would like to express gratitude to Fabian Densborn for his discovery, analysis, and coordination, as well as the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab (https://www.sec-consult.com) for responsibly reporting the identified issues and collaborating with us as we addressed them. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Added the option to use ClamAV (https://www.clamav.net/) as an antivirus scanner for temporary uploads. To enable it, add `services.ConfigureSection<Serenity.Extensions.ClamAVSettings>(Configuration);` and `services.AddSingleton<IUploadAVScanner, Serenity.Extensions.ClamAVUploadScanner>();` to your Startup.cs after upgrading to Serenity/Serenity.Extensions 6.7.0+. Consult ClamAV documentation on how to install it on your platform. This feature will be enabled by default once these changes have been made in Startup.cs. If you want to disable it for development purposes, set ClamAV:Enabled to false in your appsettings.Development.json (not recommended for production!). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Added extensionless and `.htm`/`.html` to the upload file extensions blacklist by default. An attacker can include malicious scripts in such an HTML file, send an administrative user a link to that file via email, and if the administrative user is already logged in to the site while clicking the link, the script can call services, perform actions, etc. on behalf of the user as the cookies are sent by the browser. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Ensured that the Forgot password page does not reveal information to identify whether a user with the entered email exists. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Ensured that reset password tokens can only be used once. They already expired in 3 hours, but if an attacker could see the link within that time frame (e.g., by eavesdropping), they could use it to change the password again. |
