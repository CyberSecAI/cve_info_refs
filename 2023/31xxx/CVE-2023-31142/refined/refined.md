- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When a site has modified general category permissions, they could be reset to default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of category permissions leading to a reset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Modified category permissions could be reverted to defaults. This may expose private content or allow unauthorized actions depending on the specific permissions that were overwritten.
- **Attack vectors**: Network (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: High privileges required (PR:H), User interaction required (UI:R), High attack complexity (AC:H)
