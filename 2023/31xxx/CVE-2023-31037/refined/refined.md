- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ipmitool` within the NVIDIA Bluefield 2 and Bluefield 3 DPU BMC. A root user can exploit this to inject code through a network call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability (CWE-94) is present in the `ipmitool`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** A network call is used to inject code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have root privileges on the system (PR:H) to perform the attack. The attack can be performed over the network (AV:N).
