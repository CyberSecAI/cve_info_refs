{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/eval/index.php?page=edit_faculty` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database. In this case, the provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessed via an HTTP GET request to the `/eval/index.php?page=edit_faculty` endpoint, with the malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as required for the vulnerable endpoint."
