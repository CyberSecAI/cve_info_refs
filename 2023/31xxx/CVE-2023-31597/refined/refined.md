- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zammad API does not properly validate data during user signup, allowing an attacker to bypass email verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient data validation during user signup, specifically regarding email verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a user account using an arbitrary email address, and further manipulate the user data. In some cases, this could lead to unauthorized access to existing tickets.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending manipulated data to the Zammad API during the signup process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send manipulated requests to the Zammad API.
