# Unrestricted session cookies with PATs

Moderate

[michael-markevich](/michael-markevich)
published
GHSA-44g3-9mp4-prv3
May 8, 2023

## Package

dhis2-core
(dhis2)

## Affected versions

>= 2.37

## Patched versions

2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, 2.39.1.2

## Description

### Impact

We discovered that [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/working-with-your-account/personal-access-tokens.html) (PATs), introduced in version 2.37, generate unrestricted session cookies. This may lead to a bypass of other access restrictions (for example, based on allowed IP addresses or HTTP methods).

### Patches

DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a supported version of DHIS2: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or 2.39.1.2.

### Workarounds

You can workaround this issue by adding extra access control validations on a reverse proxy.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at security@dhis2.org.

* [2.39.1.2 release notes](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-releases/blob/master/releases/2.39/ReleaseNote-2.39.1.2.md)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
