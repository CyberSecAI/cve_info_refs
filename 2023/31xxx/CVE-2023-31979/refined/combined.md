| Hello, I encountered some issues while reproducing this issue. When the source program ran ./catdoc -b global-buffer-overflow command,The program reported the following error： Cannot load charset cp1251 - file not found  Compile the program with AddressSanitizer, and running the program, still reporting the above error. Do you know what the reason is? |
