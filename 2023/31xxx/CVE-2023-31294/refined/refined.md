Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the **Delivery Name** field of the CPTO (Cash Point & Transport Optimizer) software when exporting data to a CSV file. Specifically, the software does not neutralize or escape characters that could be interpreted as spreadsheet formulas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection (CWE-1236):** The software is vulnerable to CSV injection because it allows users to insert spreadsheet formulas into the 'Delivery Name' field. These formulas can be executed when the exported CSV file is opened in spreadsheet software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When a victim opens the malicious CSV file, the injected formulas are executed by the spreadsheet software. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, leading to a variety of malicious actions, such as data theft, system compromise, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the **Delivery Name** field in the CPTO software.
- An attacker could insert malicious formulas into this field.
- The attacker then exports the data as a CSV file
- The user opens the exported CSV file in a spreadsheet application, triggering the execution of the malicious formulas.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify data within the CPTO software, specifically the **Delivery Name** field. 
- They don't need to directly access the victim's machine; the attack is triggered when the victim opens the manipulated CSV file.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory explicitly mentions characters like `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `Tab`, and `Carriage Return` should be sanitized or escaped to prevent CSV injection.
- The advisory also details how field separators (e.g., `,`, `;`) and quotes (`'`, `"`) can be exploited, and describes methods for proper CSV sanitization including wrapping cell fields in double quotes, prepending a single quote, and escaping double quotes.
- The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability and has fixed it in newer versions.
