  "description": "IC Realtime ICIP-P2012T is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via an open port\n\nIC Realtime IP PTZ Dome Camera ICIP-P2012 software version: 2.420\n\nAn exposed port (9989) responds with a live snapshot at the time of request, by using a script, it could be leveraged to have a live feed image every x second. This vulnerability critically affects confidentiality of data and could be used in reconnaissance phase (identify people, passwords etc.) for any threats.",
  "content_analysis": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an exposed port (9989) on the IC Realtime ICIP-P2012T IP PTZ Dome Camera that allows unauthorized access to a live snapshot of the camera's feed. The camera software version is 2.420.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Access Control",
      "Exposed Port"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access a live feed image every x seconds, which critically affects the confidentiality of data and could be used in the reconnaissance phase (identify people, passwords etc.) for any threats.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to exposed port (9989)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the exposed port (9989) on the target device. Basic network connectivity is sufficient.",
     "additional_details": "The provided content includes a shell script ('capture.sh') that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the exposed port and saving the response (the live snapshot) to a file. The script can be configured to capture snapshots at a specified interval."
