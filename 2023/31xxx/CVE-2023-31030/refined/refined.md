- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the host KVM daemon of the NVIDIA DGX A100 BMC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to a stack overflow, specifically a CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). This occurs when the program writes beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Denial of service
    - Information disclosure
    - Data tampering
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector is local, and no user interaction is required.
