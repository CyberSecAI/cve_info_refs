Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a **Broken Access Control** issue within the WordPress WP Quick Post Duplicator plugin. Specifically, there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms. This allows users with insufficient privileges (e.g., a "Contributor") to potentially execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as having a **low severity** and is deemed **unlikely to be exploited**. While the exact actions that can be performed are not detailed, the generic description suggests that an unprivileged user could execute functions intended for higher privileged users.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to be a logged-in user with "Contributor" level permissions to exploit this vulnerability. The specific method of exploitation (i.e., how the missing check is bypassed) is not detailed in this report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least "Contributor" privileges within the WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable function of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects versions of the WP Quick Post Duplicator plugin **<= 2.0**.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version **2.1**.
* The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A5: Broken Access Control
*  The CVSS score is 5.4, with a severity of "Low"
