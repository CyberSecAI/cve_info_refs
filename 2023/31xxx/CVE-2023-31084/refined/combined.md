Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in the
    KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which may
    allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
    result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
    lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi
    driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit
    this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-
    use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller driver. A local user with
    access to a SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
    mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-2898

    It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file
    system may result in denial of service if a malformed file
    system is accessed.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver that
    can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an unprivileged
    user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Davide Ornaghi discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free. A local user can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-3389

    Querijn Voet discovered a use-after-free in the io_uring subsystem,
    which may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3611

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write in the traffic control
    subsystem for the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler (QFQ) may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3609 / CVE-2023-3776 / CVE-2023-4128

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls_fw, cls_u32,
    cls_route and network classifiers may result in denial of service or
    potential local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3863

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the NFC implementation
    may result in denial of service, an information leak or potential
    local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-4004

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in Netfilter's
    implementation of PIPAPO (PIle PAcket POlicies) may result in denial
    of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-4132

    A use-after-free in the driver for Siano SMS1xxx based MDTV
    receivers may result in local denial of service.

CVE-2023-4147

    Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when adding a
    rule with NFTA_RULE_CHAIN_ID, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace.

CVE-2023-4194

    A type confusion in the implementation of TUN/TAP network devices
    may allow a local user to bypass network filters.

CVE-2023-4273

    Maxim Suhanov discovered a stack overflow in the exFAT driver, which
    may result in local denial of service via a malformed file system.

CVE-2023-20588

    Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Koepf and
    Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that on some AMD CPUs with the Zen1
    micro architecture an integer division by zero may leave stale
    quotient data from a previous division, resulting in a potential
    leak of sensitive data.

CVE-2023-21255

    A use-after-free was discovered in the in the Android binder driver,
    which may result in local privilege escalation on systems where the
    binder driver is loaded.

CVE-2023-21400

    Ye Zhang and Nicolas Wu discovered a double-free in the io_uring
    subsystem, which may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
    locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2023-34319

    Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
    which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
    virtualisation host my sending malformed packets.

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua that an off-by-one in the Flower traffic classifier may
    result in local of service or the execution of privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-40283

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket handling.

media: dvb-core: Fix kernel WARNING for blocking operation in wait\_event\*()Using a semaphore in the wait\_event\*() condition is no good idea.
It hits a kernel WARN\_ON() at prepare\_to\_wait\_event() like:
do not call blocking ops when !TASK\_RUNNING; state=1 set at
prepare\_to\_wait\_event+0x6d/0x690
For avoiding the potential deadlock, rewrite to an open-coded loop
instead. Unlike the loop in wait\_event\*(), this uses wait\_woken()
after the condition check, hence the task state stays consistent.
CVE-2023-31084 was assigned to this bug.

Subject: [BUG: WARNING in dvb_frontend_get_event](#r)
Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2023 21:50:07 -0700	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CA+UBctCu7fXn4q41O_3=id1+OdyQ85tZY1x+TkT-6OVBL6KAUw@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

Hello,

We found the following issue using syzkaller on Linux v6.2.0.

In the function `dvb_frontend_get_event`, function
`wait_event_interruptible` is called
and the condition is `dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv, events)`.
In the function `dvb_frontend_test_event`, function
`down(&fepriv->sem);` is called.
However, function `wait_event_interruptible` would put the process to sleep.
And function `down(&fepriv->sem);` may block the process.
So there is the issue with "do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING".

The full report including the Syzkaller reproducer & C reproducer:
<https://gist.github.com/ZHYfeng/4c5f8be6adc63b73dba68230d15ece2c>

The brief report is below:

Syzkaller hit 'WARNING in dvb_frontend_get_event' bug.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the
    Linux kernel did not properly handled user-supplied data, resulting
    in a triggerable assertion. An unauthenticated remote attacker can
    take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
    mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3269

    Ruihan Li discovered that incorrect lock handling for accessing and
    updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) may result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
    locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2023-32250 / CVE-2023-32254

    Quentin Minster discovered two race conditions in KSMBD, a kernel
    server which implements the SMB3 protocol, which could result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.37-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller
    driver. A local user with access to a SCSI device using this

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.
