Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause lies within the MySQL JDBC connection, which is susceptible to both arbitrary file read and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities when connecting to a malicious MySQL server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Arbitrary File Read:** The MySQL JDBC driver allows the reading of arbitrary files from the server's file system. This is due to the usage of the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` functionality which is enabled by default.
2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The JDBC connection allows the server to initiate requests to arbitrary URLs. This is due to the default enabled functionality of using URLs in certain connection parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the server hosting the application using this connection, leading to information disclosure.
2.  **SSRF:** An attacker can make internal requests to other services on the network from the context of the vulnerable server, potentially compromising other systems by bypassing security controls (e.g., firewall, authentication).

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Malicious MySQL Server:** An attacker needs to set up a malicious MySQL server.
2. **Vulnerable Connection:**  The victim application must establish a JDBC connection with the attacker's malicious server.
3. **Exploitation of `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` and URL Parameter functionality**: The attacker can trigger the arbitrary file read by using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` command. The attacker can also trigger SSRF by having the JDBC connection parameter contain a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  The attacker needs to control a MySQL server and have the victim application connect to it.
2. No prior authentication is needed on the target application as the attacker takes advantage of default MySQL JDBC connection behavior.

**Additional Details:**
The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including:
* The specific vulnerability details are described in the context of a Github issue, with images showing exploitation steps.
* A repair suggestion is given, recommending to set properties `allowLoadLocalInfile` and `allowUrlInLocalInfile` to `false`.
