Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an assertion failure within the JerryScript JavaScript engine's parser, specifically during the parsing of function arguments. The assertion `context_p->next_scanner_info_p->type == SCANNER_TYPE_FUNCTION` fails, indicating an unexpected state in the parsing process. This occurs when parsing an asynchronous generator method definition `async#* method (  ` within a class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Assertion failure: The code makes an assumption about the parser's internal state (specifically, the `scanner_info` type) when processing a function's arguments that is not always valid, leading to a crash due to the failed assertion.
- Parsing logic error: The parser logic does not correctly handle the combination of asynchronous generators and class methods, leading to the assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability causes a crash of the JerryScript engine due to the assertion failure. This can be triggered by a malicious JavaScript code, effectively causing a denial of service. The engine aborts execution when the assertion fails.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code: By crafting a specific JavaScript code snippet, an attacker can trigger the assertion failure. Specifically, an asynchronous generator method definition within a class is the trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript: The attacker must have the capability to provide or execute the malicious JavaScript code with an impacted version of the JerryScript engine.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `parser_parse_function_arguments` function within `jerryscript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser.c`
- The crash is triggered by a specific syntax combination: `async#* method ( `.
- The provided test case clearly demonstrates how to trigger the assertion failure.
- The provided backtrace shows the call stack leading up to the crash, providing information for debugging the issue.
- The issue occurs in JerryScript version v3.0.0, on Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Linux 5.4.0-144-generic x86_64).
- The build process utilizes specific compile flags.
- This information is based on the provided GitHub issue.
