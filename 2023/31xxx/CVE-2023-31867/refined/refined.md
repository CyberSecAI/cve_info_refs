Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31867

**Vulnerable Product:** Sage X3 - version 12.14.0.50-0 (potentially other builds may be affected)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application embeds untrusted input into CSV files without proper sanitization.
- Spreadsheet programs interpret cells starting with "=" as formulas. This allows for the injection of malicious formulas.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Computer Hijacking:** Malicious formulas can exploit vulnerabilities in spreadsheet software (e.g., CVE-2014-3524) to take control of the user's machine.
- **User-Ignored Warnings:** Users might ignore security warnings when opening spreadsheets they downloaded from their own website, making them vulnerable.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious formulas can be used to extract data from the spreadsheet or other open spreadsheets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting malicious data into fields that end up in CSV exports from the application.
- Specifically, crafting formulas by starting cells with “=”.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated administrator user of the Sage X3 application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Maxime Dupuis and Romain Delaunay from DIGITEMIS CYBERSECURITY & PRIVACY.
-  An update is available to remediate the vulnerability.
