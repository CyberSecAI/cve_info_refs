- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system failed to check if an automation user was disabled during the authentication process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control; disabled automation users could still authenticate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system by using a disabled automation user account, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access is required for authentication
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the credentials of a disabled automation user to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send an authentication request over the network.
