Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31445

**Affected Vendor:** Cassia Networks

**Affected Product:** Access Controller

**Affected Version:** Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2203171453

**Vulnerability:** Unprivileged Information Disclosure

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the Access Controller's API. Specifically, read-only users can manipulate the `/admin/(userId)/edit` endpoint to access and disclose information of other users by changing the `userId` parameter in the request, which is not properly validated against the user's permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application fails to validate if the read-only user is authorized to access the requested user ID, allowing them to view data associated with other user accounts by manipulating the user ID.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** There is a lack of sufficient permission validation on the `/admin/(userId)/edit` endpoint. It allows read-only users to access resources they are not permitted to view.
*   **Predictable User IDs:** User IDs are based on the creation date represented as a UNIX timestamp, which can be easily obtained from the system logs, making it trivial for attackers to guess valid IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Read-only users can access and disclose sensitive information of other users, including email addresses, phone numbers, and user privileges.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information can be used to perform targeted email campaigns, social engineering attacks, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct API Manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the API request using tools like Burp Suite to change the `userId` parameter and bypass access restrictions.
*  **Brute Force:** The attacker can iterate through potential `userId` values, and the predictable nature of user IDs makes brute force attacks feasible.
*   **Log Analysis:** The attacker can retrieve user creation times from logs and convert them to UNIX timestamps to easily generate user IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to a Read-Only User Account:** The attacker needs a legitimate read-only user account on the Access Controller.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify API Requests:** The attacker needs tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests to change parameters.
*   **Basic Understanding of System Logs:** The attacker needs the ability to access and interpret system logs to obtain user creation timestamps.
* **Basic understanding of UNIX timestamps and how to generate them from logs.**

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
* The vulnerability was confirmed by the vendor and fixed in version `Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2207292123`.
