  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An API endpoint for all GL.iNET devices reveals information about the WiFi configuration, including SSID and key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `/api/router/mesh/status` endpoint can be accessed without any sort of authentication, exposing sensitive WiFi configuration details.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain the SSID and key for the router's WiFi network. In non-standard configurations where the web GUI is accessible from the WAN, this allows the attacker to connect to the internal LAN. The exposed SSID key might be related to the admin password, potentially granting full control of the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending an HTTP POST request to the `/api/router/mesh/status` endpoint without authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This could be from the LAN side, or, in non-standard configurations, from the WAN side if the firewall rules are not properly configured."
