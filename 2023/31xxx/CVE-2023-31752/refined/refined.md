The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `username` parameter in the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Login.php` script is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of sanitization of user input in the username parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the administrator account.
- An attacker can gain full control of the information about other accounts.
- Information disclosure, and unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/employee_gatepass/classes/login.php` with the `username` parameter containing malicious SQL code and a valid `password` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No prior authentication is required, as the vulnerability is in the login function.
