Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `manage_subject.php` file of the Faculty Evaluation System, where the `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data leakage:** The provided payload demonstrates the ability to extract the database name, which could lead to further information disclosure.
- **Database manipulation:**  An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, compromise other user accounts, or escalate privileges, depending on the database permissions and application design.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `manage_subject.php` with a modified `id` parameter containing the SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges are mentioned in the report to perform this attack, implying that any user capable of sending requests can potentially exploit this vulnerability if the application is publicly available.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and basic understanding of HTTP requests are necessary to craft a working attack.
