# Missing NULL pointer check in IPv6 neighbor discovery

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-x29r-5qjg-75mq
May 4, 2023

## Package

uip-nd6

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

The Contiki-NG operating system can be triggered to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code for IPv6 router solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c. The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.

The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type uip\_ds6\_nbr\_t.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release.

### Workarounds

Users can apply Contiki-NG pull request [#2271](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2271) to patch the problem directly.

### @Scepticz **[Scepticz](/Scepticz)** commented [Nov 9, 2022](#issue-1442641363)

Add a NULL pointer check to the return value of `uip_ds6_nbr_add` in the SLLAO link-layer address change case of Router Solicitation messages.

Sorry, something went wrong.
