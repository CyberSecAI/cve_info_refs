Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient session expiration in the Cash Point & Transport Optimizer (CPTO) application, specifically version 6.3.8.6. The application does not properly invalidate session data upon logout, allowing cached data to be accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613):** The core issue is the failure to properly invalidate or clear session data when a user logs out. This leaves sensitive information, such as cached username and password, accessible.
*   **Back-Back-Refresh Attack:** The application is susceptible to a Back-Back-Refresh attack. This allows the attacker to navigate back to a previous page after logout, where the cached data is still present.
*   **Lack of Proper Handling of Cached Data:** The browser's handling of cached data after logout isn't properly mitigated by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Credential Theft:** An attacker can steal the username and password of a logged-out user by intercepting cached credentials. This would allow unauthorized access to the user's account.
*   **Compromised Application Data:** Depending on the application's functionality, this access could lead to further data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Low Security Risk**: The security risk is considered low.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires an attacker with local access to the victim's computer and web browser.
*   **Browser Manipulation:** The attacker uses the browser's back button to navigate to a previously logged-in page.
*   **Web Developer Tools:** The attacker uses browserâ€™s Web Developer Tools to intercept the cached username and password from the Document Expired page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have physical or remote access to the victim's machine where the application was used.
*   **Basic Browser Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate the browser and use web developer tools.
*   **Timing:** The attack occurs after the user has logged out but before the browser cache has been cleared or session invalidated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions the vendor has fixed the issue in a later version of the CPTO application.
*   The advisory contains a timeline of vulnerability discovery, responsible disclosure process, and publication date.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marcus Nilsson of usd AG.
*   The advisory was published by usd AG.
