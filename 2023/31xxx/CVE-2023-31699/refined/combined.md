| **If you have the ChurchCRM software running, please file an issue using the *Report an issue* in the help menu.** On what page in the application did you find this issue? I got issue CSVImport.php page. On what type of server is this running? Dedicated / Shared hosting? Linux / Windows? Windows Server What browser (and version) are you running? Brave browser [Version 1.50.119 Chromium: 112.0.5615.121] What version of PHP is the server running? 7.4.29 What version of SQL Server are you running? Apache/2.4.53 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1n PHP/7.4.29 What version of ChurchCRM are you running? v4.5.4  **Description:** I found Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in your ChurchCRM (v4.5.4) "Admin" menu to CSV Import page there Import data CSV uploader option. When I upload image file there malicious code inserted in image then the browser give me result. Because a browser can not know if the script should be trusted or not.  **CMS Version:** v4.5.4  **Affected URL:** <http://127.0.0.1/churchcrm/CSVImport.php>  **Steps to Reproduce:**   1. First login your admin panel. 2. Then click "Admin" menu and click "CSV Import" and you will get CSV file uploder option.   [screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232332551-5ea4c781-dd59-4d8e-be83-4db80c1ccfd4.png)   3. now insert xss payload in jpg file using exiftool or from image properties.   [screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232332360-b6df1df6-bc36-4cff-a9c5-927fd58e4c70.png)   4. after then upload the jpg file. 5. you will see XSS pop up.   [screenshot3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41516016/232332372-68a8d35d-e3f6-4ffc-8609-95a671c7c6e5.png)  **Proof of Concept:** You can see the Proof of Concept. Which I've attached screenshots and video to confirm the vulnerability.    poc.mp4     **Impact:** Attackers can make use of this to conduct attacks like phishing, steal sessions etc.  Let me know if any further info is required.
