  "CVE-2023-31248": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "Match": "Partial",
      "Classification": "Vulnerability"
    },
    "Summary": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Linux kernel's Netfilter nf_tables implementation, specifically within the nft_chain_lookup_byid function. This vulnerability can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace can exploit this issue for local privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is a missing check in `nft_chain_lookup_byid` that fails to verify whether a chain was active, leading to a use-after-free condition when referring to a deleted chain within the same batch.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). It could also enable a local privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vector": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace to trigger the use-after-free condition, which can lead to local privilege escalation.",
    "Affected products": [
      "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S",
      "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C",
      "NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)",
      "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node",
      "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Storage Node (Element Software)"
    ],
    "Fix information": "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S and NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C have no plans to address this vulnerability. Other affected products are under investigation for a potential fix. Patches for Linux kernel are available in various distributions (e.g. Debian, Red Hat)."
