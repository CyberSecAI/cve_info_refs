Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-31196:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for critical functions in the affected Wi-Fi AP UNIT devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The device does not properly authenticate access to critical functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially steal sensitive information from the device, such as the authentication credentials for the management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker only needs network access to the device.

**Additional details:**
* The affected products are Wi-Fi AP UNIT models: AC-PD-WAPU, AC-PD-WAPUM, AC-PD-WAPU-P, AC-PD-WAPUM-P, AC-WAPU-300, AC-WAPUM-300, AC-WAPU-300-P, and AC-WAPUM-300-P, running specific vulnerable firmware versions.
*  The vendor has stated that the affected products are no longer supported and will not receive a software fix.
* The vendor recommends workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, such as changing the default IP address, restricting access to the web UI, and implementing MAC address filtering.
