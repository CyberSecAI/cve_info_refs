```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unrestricted file upload in the `/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation, leading to the possibility of uploading malicious files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) via the vulnerable endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. Knowledge of the time of upload is necessary to guess the uploaded file name, since it is constructed by a timestamp. However, the timestamp can be calculated easily."
