Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-31910.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `parser_parse_function_statement` function in `js-parser-statm.c`. This is triggered by a crafted JavaScript input that includes a class with a static block containing a large number, along with an invalid function definition within the class, which causes an out-of-bounds read. The parsing logic fails to properly handle this specific structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
- Assertion failure: In debugging mode, an assertion fails due to an insufficient number of scopes in the scope stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: The heap-buffer-overflow can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
- Denial of service: The program crashes due to the heap-buffer-overflow, which results in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript input: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing malicious JavaScript code as input to the JerryScript engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the crafted JavaScript input to be parsed by the vulnerable JerryScript engine.
