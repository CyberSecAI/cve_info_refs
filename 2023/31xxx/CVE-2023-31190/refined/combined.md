# Insecure Firmware Update

CVE-2023-31190

Subscribe to Labs
## Summary

DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is affected by an Improper Authentication vulnerability during the firmware update procedure.

### Impact

The firmware update procedure ignores and does not check the validity of the TLS certificate of the HTTPS endpoint from which the firmware update package (.tar.bz2 file) is downloaded. An attacker with the ability to put himself in a Man-in-the-Middle situation can trick the DroneScout ds230 to install a crafted malicious firmware update.

### Issue Date

July 10, 2023

### Affects

The vulnerability affects: DroneScout ds230 from firmware version 20211210-1627 to firmware version 20230329-1042

### CVEÂ Name

### CVSSÂ Details

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVSS Score

8.1

### Solution

## Research Projects

### TRITON

TRITON is the first known cyberattack that directly interacted with a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). Labs reverse engineered the TriStation suite of software and delivered a report and two free tools for security researchers. This research was presented at Black Hat USA 2018.

### GreyEnergy

The Labs team reverse engineered the GreyEnergy malicious document (maldoc) that leads to the installation of the malware (backdoor) on a victimâs network. Project outcomes include a report, multiple blogs and two free tools for security researchers.

### IEC 62351

IEC Working Group 15 (WG15) is developing technology standards for secure-by-design power systems. Labs contributes to the standards and has demonstrated how they can be used to identify hard-to-detect cyberattacks. Research from this effort was presented at Black Hat USA 2019.

20240927-1205
- added new features
\* use LTE add-on as GNSS (GPS) receiver and send MQTT location message of the sensor location
\* send MQTT mobile network message if the LTE add-on is used
\* support for ADS-B 1090 MHz reception using the ADS-B receiver add-on
\* support for UAT 978 MHz reception using the UAT receiver add-on
- this firmware update will not update the dronescout.conf with new options. These have to be manually added.
- more info in the latest receiver manual (version 2.1)
20240717-1353
- bug fix in wlan channel list. Channel 133 should be 153 instead
- added option raw\_data to include the raw data of the air interface in the MQTT message
20240619-1243
- bug fix firmware update script allowed to upgrade firmware with incorrect checksum
20240528-1739
- bug fix commented WLAN\_USB\_x lines were considered to be used by scripts.
- added the parameter status\_interval\_s in dronescout.conf. It determines how often the status messages are generated in seconds. Default every minute (60 seconds).
20240315-2154
- bug fix sensor stuck in bootloader (ds230/ds240) by upgrading bootloader. Some sensors were affected, stuck every 10th to 20th (hot) reboot.
- bug fix multipage auth reception
20240130-1326
- bug fix creation of zombie processes (harmless)
- bug fix start process, initialization of wlan interfaces was incomplete resulting in starting the application twice (start, crash, start) instead of once
- added support for Docker builds/licenses
20240108-1539
- add debug output for the MQTT connection in /tmp/mqtt.log
- add dummy CPU load to increase the temperature in cold environments. This should benefit the reliability if the outside temperature is -20 degree Celsius
20231012-1105
- add watchdog function to check if the wlan adapters are still in monitor mode
- improved reboot function; sometimes reboot was not executed and the sensor did not reboot
20231006-1600
- bug fix, resetting wlan interfaces to monitor mode in case the dronescout process was terminated
- bug fix, when rebooting, shutdown wireless interfaces
- added a hook/script /root/custom.sh. Here, custom code (outside firmware) can be implemented
20230920-1626
- bug fix 100% cpu load in transmit\_mode = 2
- support for ds240 receiver
20230828-1643
- remove esptool reset ble device
- add support for new ds230 rx board (instead of seperate wlan/ble adapters)
20230605-1350
- removed --insecure flag from update script to make sure only firmware is downloaded from the official download.bluemark.io server
- improved algorithm to surpress WLAN transponder signals on neighbouring channels in case the RSSI is very strong: only surpress adjacnet channel detections if the payload is similar.
- added description about the potential risks of using transmit mode 1. It is recommended to switch to mode 2.
20230329-1042
- add transmit mode 2: combine all Remote ID payloads into one MQTT message at publish it at a user-defined interval.
20230104-1650
- implement an algorithm to surpress WLAN transponder signals on neighbouring channels in case the RSSI is very strong. (If for instance a tranponder is detected on channel 6 at -45 dBm, it will also be detected at channel 4, 5 7 and 8. The algorithm will suppress those detections on adjacent channels.)
20221213-2153
- bug fix, version 20221208-1250 did have some internal code parts enabled by mistake.
20221208-1250
- added two options transmit\_mode and aggregate\_data in dronescout.conf. See manual.
- don't output debug/verbose information during firmware upgrade
- improved reboot function. In case the PoE power supply is at a critical level (e.g. bad cable, old PoE switch), shutdown first interfaces to prevent a hanging sensor.
20211210-1627
- first public release
