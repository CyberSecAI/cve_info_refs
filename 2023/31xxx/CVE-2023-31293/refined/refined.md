Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31293

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** in the Cash Point & Transport Optimizer (CPTO) software. Specifically, the access control mechanism failed to prevent a "reader" user from accessing the journal feature, even when this feature was explicitly disabled for their user profile.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-284 Improper Access Control:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce the intended access restrictions based on user roles and permissions. The system allowed a lower-privileged user (reader) to access a feature (journal) that should have been restricted for their profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A reader user can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information contained in the journal. The specific impact of accessing the journal isn't described in detail, but generally this type of journal would contain sensitive transaction data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Access:** The attack vector is direct access by a user who has "reader" level privileges, but shouldn't have access to the journal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid "reader" user account.
*   No additional privileges or special position is needed, it's an inherent flaw in the software's access control implementation.
