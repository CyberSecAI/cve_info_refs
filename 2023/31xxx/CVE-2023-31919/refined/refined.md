The provided content describes a crash in the JerryScript engine triggered by a specific JavaScript code snippet. This crash is due to a failed assertion related to pending exceptions within the engine's context.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failed assertion within the `jcontext_raise_exception` function of the JerryScript engine. This assertion checks if there are no pending exceptions before raising a new one. The provided JavaScript code triggers a state where this assertion fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an assertion failure leading to a crash. The provided javascript code triggers a syntax error related to RegExp flags but the engine fails to handle it correctly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically a crash of the JerryScript engine.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted JavaScript code snippet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a JerryScript environment.
