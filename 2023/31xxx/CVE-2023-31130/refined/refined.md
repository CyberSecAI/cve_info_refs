  "CVE-2023-31130": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "The `ares_inet_net_pton()` function is vulnerable to a buffer underflow when processing certain IPv6 addresses.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer underflow in the `ares_inet_net_pton()` function."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to denial of service or disclosure of sensitive information. More severe issues may arise if external applications use the vulnerable function.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the vulnerable `ares_inet_net_pton()` function with a specially crafted IPv6 address, such as \"0::00:00:00/2\"."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide specific input (IPv6 addresses) to the vulnerable function. In c-ares's own use, this is limited to an administrator being able to configure such an address via `ares_set_sortlist()`. However, other programs that use this function externally might be more vulnerable."
