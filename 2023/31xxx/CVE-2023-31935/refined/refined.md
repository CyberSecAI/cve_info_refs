Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and displaying it back to the user. Specifically, the "Email address" field in the admin profile update form (`admin-profile.php`) does not properly filter or encode special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application directly inserts user-provided input from the `email` parameter into the database without any encoding or sanitization.
*   **Unescaped Output:** The stored email value is later displayed in the `admin-profile.php` and `add-profile.php` pages without encoding, allowing the execution of the stored XSS payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field.
*   When the admin views the profile page (`admin-profile.php`) or `add-profile.php`, the stored malicious script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, admin credentials).
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Other malicious actions within the application's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by:
    1.  Intercepting and modifying the POST request sent to `admin-profile.php` when updating the admin profile. The attacker would inject the malicious JavaScript payload in the email address field.
    2.  The server-side script, upon receiving this request, updates the database with the payload.
    3.  Whenever an admin user views the admin profile page (`admin-profile.php`) or `add-profile.php`, the stored XSS payload executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and modify POST requests to the `admin-profile.php` page. This likely means the attacker needs to be an authenticated user or have the means to bypass authentication.
*   The attacker needs to know where the vulnerable input field is, specifically the Email Address field in the admin profile update form.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Technical Details**
The provided code snippet shows the following:
* The email parameter is taken directly from the POST request without sanitization.
*  The parameter is used in the update query
*  The email parameter is also rendered directly into the HTML
```php
if(isset($_POST['submit']))
{
    $adminid=$_SESSION['bpmsaid'];
    $AName=$_POST['adminname'];
    $mobno=$_POST['mobilenumber'];
    $email=$_POST['email'];
    $sql="update tbladmin set AdminName=:adminname,MobileNumber=:mobilenumber,Email=:email where ID=:aid";
    $query = $dbh->prepare($sql);
    $query->bindParam(':adminname',$AName,PDO::PARAM_STR);
    $query->bindParam(':email',$email,PDO::PARAM_STR);
    $query->bindParam(':mobilenumber',$mobno,PDO::PARAM_STR);
    $query->bindParam(':aid',$adminid,PDO::PARAM_STR);
    $query->execute();
    echo '<script>alert("Profile has been updated.")</script>';

}
```

```html
<div class="form-group"> <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label> <input type="email" name="email" value="<?php  echo $row->Email;?>" class="form-control" required='true'> </div>
```

**Payload Example:**
The attacker can use the following payload for the email address field:
`"><script>alert(2)</script><%40gmail.com`

This payload closes the input tag, injects the `<script>` tag containing a JavaScript `alert()` function, and then adds a valid email address part `%40gmail.com` to satisfy the email format validation check in the front end.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting attack on the admin user of the application.
