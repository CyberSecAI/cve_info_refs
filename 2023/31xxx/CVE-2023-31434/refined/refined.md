Root cause of vulnerability: The web application lacks proper input sanitization, allowing injection of malicious code.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: JavaScript or HTML code can be injected into user profile fields like "Titel," "Vorname," and "Nachname," leading to execution of the injected code in different parts of the web application.
  - Reflected XSS vulnerability: A user with the "Trainer" role can inject malicious code through a crafted link. This link generates a server-generated online ID, which, when accessed by an unauthenticated user, executes the injected payload.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
  - Potential for account hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
  - Persistent XSS can lead to ongoing attacks against other users.
  - Reflected XSS can target users through manipulated links.

Attack vectors:
  - User profile fields are vulnerable to stored XSS injection.
  - Crafted URLs allow for reflected XSS injection.
  - A crafted link can lead to persistent XSS attacks if it is sent to other users

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - For stored XSS, an attacker needs a valid account and access to user profile modification.
  - For reflected XSS, an attacker needs the ability to create a crafted URL with malicious code. A user with "Trainer" role can generate the vulnerable link.
  - For persistent XSS via generated links, an attacker needs to be able to generate the vulnerable links and send them to other users.
