### **[eqawasm](/eqawasm)** commented [Apr 4, 2023](#issue-1654461307)

| **Impact:**  The latest version bastet-v8.1.16 has a path traversal vulnerability that allows the attacker to create or write to files outside the current directory due to improper string comparisons between canonical paths.  **How to reproduce:**  ``` wget https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/archive/refs/tags/bastet-v8.1.16.tar.gz tar -xzf bastet-v8.1.16.tar.gz cd cbang-bastet-v8.1.16/tests scons cd tarTests # place poc.tar in this directory ./tar --extract poc.tar # verify attack worked cat ../tarTests.d/config  ```  **Root cause:**     [cbang/src/cbang/tar/TarFileReader.cpp](https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/blob/eae4b58965bdd4d54ea9eb77972674352b37a547/src/cbang/tar/TarFileReader.cpp#L102-L106)  Lines 102 to 106 in [eae4b58](/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/commit/eae4b58965bdd4d54ea9eb77972674352b37a547)   |  | string a = SystemUtilities::getCanonicalPath(\_path); | | --- | --- | |  | string b = SystemUtilities::getCanonicalPath(path); | |  | if (!String::startsWith(b, a)) | |  | THROW("Tar path points outside of the extraction directory: " << path); | |  | } |      The root cause is the return true value in function [startsWith](https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/blob/eae4b58965bdd4d54ea9eb77972674352b37a547/src/cbang/String.cpp#L537) in String.cpp that passes if condition in function [TarFileReader::extract](https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/blob/eae4b58965bdd4d54ea9eb77972674352b37a547/src/cbang/tar/TarFileReader.cpp#L104) in TarFileReader.cpp.  **PoC image:**  Extract `poc.zip` to obtain `poc.tar`: [poc.zip](https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/files/11152165/poc.zip) |
