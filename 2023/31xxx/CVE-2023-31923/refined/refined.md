- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing server-side validation when creating new users. Specifically, the user role/privilege is controlled by the `id` parameter in the PUT request when adding a new user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insufficient server-side validation of user-provided input.
    - The application relies on client-side controls to prevent the creation of privileged users, which can be easily bypassed.
    - Privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can create a new user with full administrator privileges.
    - This allows the attacker to gain complete control of the BioStar 2 system.
    - They can delete, modify, and add any user or door.
    - They can access all user information, including those from Active Directory if integrated.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must be authenticated as a "User Operator".
    - The attacker intercepts the PUT request to create a new user, using a proxy or other tool.
    - The attacker modifies the `id` parameter in the request from the default "User Operator" level to that of an "Administrator" or equivalent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a valid "User Operator" of the BioStar 2 web application.
    - The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., by using a proxy).
    - No other special capabilities are needed.
