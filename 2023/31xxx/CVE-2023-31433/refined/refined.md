Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-31433:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the "welche" parameter within the "Logbuch" component of the Evasys web application. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
- The vulnerability exists in the "Logbuch" component.
-  The parameter "welche" is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information. The provided example demonstrates the ability to extract database table names and user credentials.
- **Data Manipulation:** Beyond reading data, attackers could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues or denial of service.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining user credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application and its features.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/project/SearchProject/` endpoint.
- **Modified "welche" Parameter:** The "welche" parameter within the POST request is manipulated to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the attacker uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to inject a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Evasys application. The Logbuch component is only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send HTTP requests to the Evasys web server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads. The content indicates the ability to use boolean-based blind, stacked queries and UNION queries.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using techniques like boolean-based blind SQL injection, stacked queries, and UNION queries.
- The successful exploit using UNION queries requires an understanding of the number of columns returned in the original query. The provided example shows a successful injection using 9 columns. If the number of columns is incorrect, the server will return an error (HTTP 500).
- The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
- The vendor was contacted and patches were released.
- The vulnerability was found in evasys v8.2 Build 2275 - 2285 and evasys v9.0 Build 2400. It was fixed in v8.2 Build 2286 and v9.0 Build 2401.
