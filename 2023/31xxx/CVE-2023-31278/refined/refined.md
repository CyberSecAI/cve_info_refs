{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., HMI).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing maliciously crafted project files (e.g., HMI).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to provide a malicious project file to the vulnerable application. The attack requires user interaction (opening the malicious file) and has low complexity, indicating that exploitation is relatively straightforward once the malicious file is prepared."
