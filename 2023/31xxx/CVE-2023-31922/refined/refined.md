    "cveID": "CVE-2023-31922",
    "description": "QuickJS commit 2788d71 was discovered to contain a stack-overflow via the component js_proxy_isArray at quickjs.c.",

  },
  "technicalDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `js_proxy_isArray` and `JS_IsArray` functions can call each other recursively, leading to a stack overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to mutual recursion between `js_proxy_isArray` and `JS_IsArray`."
    ],
    "impact": "A stack overflow can crash the application.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Crafting a JavaScript payload that creates a proxy object that recursively calls itself when `isArray` is called."
    ],
   "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a QuickJS environment."
  },
  "additionalNotes": [
   "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a stack overflow check in the `js_proxy_isArray` function before calling `JS_isArray(ctx, s->target)`.",
      "The fix was implemented and tested using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) to ensure that stack overflows are detected during testing.",
   "A regression test was added to `tests/test_builtin.js` to verify the fix. The test ensures that the vulnerability triggers an `InternalError` with a \"stack overflow\" message when the fix is not applied, and passes with the fix in place.",
  "The fix was backported to other forks of the quickjs project."
