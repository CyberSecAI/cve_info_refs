Who actually decides when something receives a CVE?  This can be used to
defame projects and products as in this case.

# Perl HTTP::Tiny has insecure TLS default, affecting CPAN.pm and other modules

15/04/23 â sgo

**UPDATE 2023-06-12:** [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) has been released with a fix.

[CVE-2023-31486] [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny) v0.082, is a http client included in
Perl (since v5.13.9) and also a standalone CPAN module. It [does not verify TLS
certificates by default](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny#SSL-SUPPORT) requiring users to opt-in with the `verify_SSL=>1` flag to verify the identity of the HTTPS server they are communicating with.

The module is used by
[many](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) distributions on
CPAN, and likely other open source and proprietary software.

> **NOTE:** This post summarizes security problems caused by the insecure default
> and how it affects code relying on it for https. For a
> discussion on how this is being addressed upstream, please see
> [RFC: Making SSL\_verify safer](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152)

## Affected CPAN Modules

After
[PSA: HTTP::Tiny disabled SSL verification by
default!](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/111tadi/psa_httptiny_disabled_ssl_verification_by_default/) was posted on Reddit, we were reminded that this might be a bigger problem than first thought.

So we searched trough
[metacpan-cpan-extracted](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-cpan-extracted)
to find distributions using HTTP::Tiny without specifying the cert verification
behaviour. Distros using it without mentioning `verify_SSL` somewhere in the code was flagged. See [hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) for the full list.

Most distributions we found did not enable the certificate verification feature, potentially exposing users to [machine-in-the-middle](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-machine-in-the-middle-attacks/Machine-in-the-middle) attacks via a [CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) weakness.

* [CVE-2023-31484] [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN) v2.34 downloads and executes code from
  `https://cpan.org` without verifying server certs. Fixed in [v2.35-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/ANDK/CPAN-2.35-TRIAL).
  ([patch](https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/9c98370287f4e709924aee7c58ef21c85289a7f0))
* [CVE-2023-31485] [GitLab::API::v4](https://metacpan.org/dist/GitLab-API-v4) v0.26 exposes API
  secrets to a network attacker. Fixed in [v0.27](https://metacpan.org/release/BLUEFEET/GitLab-API-v4-0.27)
  ([patch](https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/pull/57))
* [Finance::Robinhood](https://metacpan.org/dist/Finance-Robinhood) v0.21 is
  maybe exposing API secrets and financial information to a network
  attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/sanko/Finance-Robinhood/pull/6))
* [Paws (aws-sdk-perl)](https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws) v0.44 is
  maybe exposing API secrets to a network attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/pull/426))
* [CloudHealth::API](https://metacpan.org/pod/CloudHealth%3A%3AAPI) v0.01 is maybe
  exposing API secrets to a network attacker.
  ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/cloudhealth-api-perl/pull/2))

â¦ and more. We have done a search of CPAN and generated a list of [381 potentially problematic distributions](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/).

## Mitigations

~~Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has not provided a patch or mitigation. Suggestions to change the insecure default has been turned down several times over the years due to backwards compatibility concerns~~.

Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has [merged a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/pull/153) that changes the insecure default from `0` to `1`. It is available in the development version [HTTP::Tiny v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) on CPAN, and the change is [planned to be included in perl-5.38.0](https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2023/06/this-week-in-psc-109.html).

> An escape hatch environment variable `PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT=1` has been provided for users who need to restore the previous insecure default after updating.

For additional information, please see the upstream discussion in [RFC: Making SSL\_verify safer](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152).

To mitigate the risk caused by the [CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) weakness, you have some options:

* Ensure that `HTTP::Tiny` in your include path is [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) or newer.
* Modify affected code using `HTTP::Tiny` and set `verify_SSL=>1`.
* Modify affected code to use a http client with secure defaults, like
  `Mojo::UserAgent` or `LWP::UserAgent`.
* Patch `HTTP::Tiny` on your system with [a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/commit/77f557ef84698efeb6eed04e4a9704eaf85b741d.patch) that changes the default to `verify_SSL=>1`.

> Itâs recommended that users update [Mozilla::CA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mozilla%3A%3ACA) as well, since `HTTP::Tiny` defaults to trusting certificates provided by that module. Alternatively the environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` can be set to point to the system trust store.

### @nrdvana **[nrdvana](/nrdvana)** commented [Feb 21, 2023](#issue-1592598164) • edited Loading

This module does not perform host checking on SSL connections by default. This is a major security flaw. I would expect most people to agree with that, but given the rationale in the documentation, it sounds like I need to thoroughly make the case for this change.

### Violates RFC

This module claims to be RFC compliant, but [RFC 2818](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818.html#section-3.1) says:

```
3.1.  Server Identity

   In general, HTTP/TLS requests are generated by dereferencing a URI.
   As a consequence, the hostname for the server is known to the client.
   If the hostname is available, the client MUST check it against the
   server's identity as presented in the server's Certificate message,
   in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

```

Since the RFC says "MUST", all users of a "standards compliant HTTP client" should expect that host name checking happens unless they specifically disable it.

### There Is No SSL Without Verifying The Certificate

The module documentation describes SSL encryption as being a separate feature from SSL verification, but the encryption offered by SSL is nearly useless without the verification. In almost any case where an attacker has network access to sniff packets of a communication, they also have the ability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, and a man-in-the-middle attack negates any value of the encryption. For example, in modern switched Ethernet a host will not see packets unless the packet arrives at the NIC destined for that host's MAC address. If the packet is destined for the host, then the host can just as easily play man-in-the-middle rather than re-broadcasting the packet to the gateway. If the network provider is the attacker, they control the routing of packets anyway. If the government of the internet backbone is the attacker, they also have control over routing, and so on. There is simply no value in SSL if certificate verification is not enabled. In a context where security is not relevant, people should just use plain HTTP since it is faster.

### Nobody Reads the Documentation!

Documenting this security flaw is not sufficient, as proven by the CPAN modules using it. Here's a breakdown of what I found in a dozen CPAN modules I picked at semi-random based on how important they sound:

* Exposing sensitive data to MITM:
  + [Net::DynDNS::GoDaddy](https://metacpan.org/dist/Net-DynDNS-GoDaddy/source/lib/Net/DynDNS/GoDaddy.pm#L30) - exposes DNS-modifying api keys
  + [WebService::Mackerel](https://metacpan.org/dist/WebService-Mackerel/source/lib/WebService/Mackerel.pm#L20) - exposes api keys, monitoring data
  + [WebService::Amazon::Route53](https://metacpan.org/dist/WebService-Amazon-Route53/source/lib/WebService/Amazon/Route53/API.pm#L38) - exposes key-signed DNS records (less big of a deal)
  + [WebService::S3::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/dist/WebService-S3-Tiny/source/lib/WebService/S3/Tiny.pm#L20) - exposes api keys, S3 buckets
  + [GitLab::API::v4](https://metacpan.org/dist/GitLab-API-v4/source/lib/GitLab/API/v4/RESTClient.pm#L105) - exposes access tokens and presumably anything stored in GitLab
  + [Finance::Robinhood](https://metacpan.org/dist/Finance-Robinhood/source/lib/Finance/Robinhood.pm#L559) - **EXPOSES ENTIRE STOCK PORTFOLIO**
  + [Paws](https://metacpan.org/dist/Paws/source/lib/Paws/Credential/ECSContainerProfile.pm#L36) - API for all of amazon AWS
  + [Business::Stripe::WebCheckout](https://metacpan.org/dist/Business-Stripe-WebCheckout/source/lib/Business/Stripe/WebCheckout.pm#L152) - credit card transaction data
* Just plain insecure (HTTP only)
  + [AWS::Lambda](https://metacpan.org/dist/AWS-Lambda/source/lib/AWS/Lambda/Bootstrap.pm#L46)
* Wrappers around HTTP::Tiny that did **not** bubble-up the warning about SSL:
  + [HTTP::Tiny::Paranoid](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny%3A%3AParanoid) - subclassed HTTP::Tiny with security feature but still didn't enable SSL verification!
  + [Future::HTTP](https://metacpan.org/dist/Future-HTTP/source/lib/Future/HTTP.pm)
* Actually used verify\_SSL
  + [Alien::Build](https://metacpan.org/dist/Alien-Build/source/lib/Alien/Build/Plugin/Fetch/HTTPTiny.pm#L76)
  + [Crypt::LE](https://metacpan.org/dist/Crypt-LE/source/lib/Crypt/LE.pm#L313)

### Proposed Change

I think that with 100+ public modules using HTTP::Tiny and a vast majority of them unaware of their security flaw, the greater number of internal applications that will likewise be affected, and even more untold users of those modules and applications who don't realize they have a security flaw, the only responsible thing to do is start emitting a warning from any script affected. I wrote up a patch that does this, emitting one warning the first time an SSL connection is created without any configuration of the verify\_SSL attribute.

I have also added two environment variables, one to change the default (so that end users can quickly enable SSL verification, or decide to silence the warning) and a second to override the attribute globally so that when modules start specifying `verify_SSL => 1` the end-users who actually need to disable SSL verification still have a way to do so.

My patch does not include unit tests, but if the change is acceptable I will write those next.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[SSL environment controls, and warn about insecure connections](/chansen/p5-http-tiny/pull/151/commits/b177aece79f7025a13f3cd5bb2e595459a5cf860 "SSL environment controls, and warn about insecure connections

The verify_SSL option is disabled by default, which is both a
vulnerability and an RFC 2818 violation.  Being a heavily-used
module by many in-house scripts, it is probably not practical
to change this default, but users need to be warned so that they
can apply whatever security intentions they have rather than
blindly receiving an insecure default.

This patch changes the verify_SSL attribute to remain 'undef'
if the user does not take any steps to assign a value to it.
This condition can then detect cases where an SSL connection
is being established without verification and where the user
did not op-in to this behavior.  It generates one warning
using 'warn', and then suppresses future warnings.

The first new environment variable HTTP_TINY_VERIFY_SSL_DEFAULT
is a boolean that can either opt-in to the default of false, or
change the default to true.  Both settings suppress the warning.

The second environment variable HTTP_TINY_VERIFY_SSL is a
boolean that can override the attribute chosen by users of the
module.  This will become necessary if module authors who use
HTTP::Tiny begin including the (verify_SSL => 1) setting in the
construction of the user agent but end-users of those modules
want to override the decision to allow insecure connections.
This mirrors the utility of PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME which
end-users can set to quickly permit insecure connections with
LWP::UserAgent.")`

| As you point out, other modules might use HTTP::Tiny from core without knowing about the insecure default, and exposing downstream users to mitm attacks.  This is concerning, and IMHO the default should be changed from `0` to `1` so the modules depending on HTTP::Tiny wouldn't need to be patched.  NixOS has added a patch that does this:   * <https://salsa.debian.org/perl-team/interpreter/perl/-/commit/1490431e40e22052f75a0b3449f1f53cbd27ba92> (proposed patch) * <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=954089> * [perl: `verify_SSL=>1` by default in HTTP::Tiny NixOS/nixpkgs#187480](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/187480) |

| HTTP::Tiny is very explicit in the list of RFCs that it supports and 2818 is not among that list. The documentation is very clear on the behavior and the rationale for it. You are welcome to create `HTTPS::Tiny` if you desire. |

| [@xdg](https://github.com/xdg) What's up with closing this pull request? The addition [@nrdvana](https://github.com/nrdvana) proposes here is completely reasonable, and in fact *the right thing to do*. Sure there are bad coding patterns in practice out there, but just shoving these under the carpet to ignore them *actively hurts Perl's reputation*.  Instead, bad practices should be made visible, and warning about them (like in this pull request) is completely sensible.  Please don't be part of propagating this bad habit. |

| Would you mind sharing a link to this decision? Links to previous discussions (or tickets) would also be very much appreciated – both for posterity and right now for those of us following this issue, so we get a clearer idea of existing arguments and facts.  Secondly, it seems you are deferring decisions about this module to the PSC, does this mean you're in favor of them formally taking over management of this module?  Finally – would you mind sharing with us why reconsidering this decision shouldn't be on the table? |

| [@nrdvana](https://github.com/nrdvana) [@sjn](https://github.com/sjn) [@stigtsp](https://github.com/stigtsp) As per the discussion on [#134](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/134) since this module is shipped as part of core in order to be used to bootstrap a full toolchain, this is something that needs to be discussed by the core and toolchain teams.  I look forward to participating in the perl5-porters thread and irc.perl.org #toolchain discussions about this, after which we can work out whether the documentation should be changed, a warning added if verify\_SSL isn't specified (so users have to pick explicitly what affordance they want) or some combination thereof.  Given that reality, this PR is putting the cart before the horse, and actually putting together a patch should wait until the situation has been discussed so it's in line with the resulting consensus - it would be nice if some of the work done for this could be re-used, but under the circumstances there's obviously going to be no guarantee of that.  In the mean time, if anybody wants to improve the current situation, given HTTP::Tiny is designed explicitly for situations where one is forced into minimal dependencies (and hence quite possibly has no CA cert information available at all) arguably the root issue with most of the cpan dists there is that there was never a good reason for them to be using HTTP::Tiny in the first place and patches should be sent replacing it with the full user agent they should have already been using. |

| [@shadowcat-mst](https://github.com/shadowcat-mst) I started with the reddit post before I realized that it was a core module, and I made this patch next just to be really clear about what I was proposing. (i.e. it does not "break" anything, and doesn't spam people with warnings, just a single targeted blip on stderr for the cases where it matters, and that can be prevented with an environment variable)  I do understand now that perl doesn't ship with CA information, and the module was meant as a bare-minimal http client to make tooling possible. But, 381 CPAN modules have proven that people just really want an in-core https client and that they either don't read the documentation, or don't care about security; it can't help that the module documentation itself seems kind of dismissive about verification like it is nothing more than a money grab by CA companies.  Meanwhile, aside from there being an impractical number of CPAN modules to submit bug reports to (and how do you monitor for future ones?) the big problem is that if these authors *do* update their code with `verify_SSL => 1`, there is no way for the end-user to **opt-out** of the change other than possibly awkward changes to code that they might not be familiar with. There needs to be some quick environment variable like LWP::UserAgent has that lets you connect to in-house stuff that you haven't properly configured the server or the local CA trust store. |

| [@nrdvana](https://github.com/nrdvana) I think arguably those distributions prove that people will lazily use in-core modules for stupid reasons, which has sadly been proven repeatedly (I'm going to try not to remember any of the previous examples right now for the sake of my remaining SAN score but ... yeah ...).  Anyway, it's clear this conversation has already gone horribly wrong and that given the issue has come up repeatedly already I think we're better off going discussion-first rather than patch-first, so I've opened [#152](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152) to attempt to make a start at that. |

| [@shadowcat-mst](https://github.com/shadowcat-mst) I'm getting offtopic, but I think those distributions prove that people want a batteries-included perl, and that the module name and documentation failed to communicate that it was a *partial* implementation rather than a minimalist implementation. Seeing "::Tiny" in a name is generally a good thing and for other modules means that the author has reduced the API to the pure essence of the problem. |

### @stigtsp **[stigtsp](/stigtsp)** commented [Feb 28, 2023](#issue-1603137176)

The `verify_SSL=>1` flag is missing from `HTTP::Tiny` in this distribution, and allows a network attacker to MITM connections to the GitLab server. This patch sets verify\_SSL to 1 and will make request to GitLab servers without a valid certificate fail.

Problem has been verified using [mitmproxy](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/)

MITM test with fix

```
$ PERL5LIB="./lib" script/gitlab-api-v4 projects | wc -c
Error GETing https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects (HTTP 599): Internal Exception SSL connection failed for gitlab.com: SSL connect ... at script/gitlab-api-v4 line 115.
0
```

MITM test without fix

```
$ PERL5LIB="./lib" script/gitlab-api-v4 projects | wc -c
86599
```

| Right, I read that and that's a little odd to me that "we turn it off because SSL adds a class in servers by discriminating non-paid certificates" is the default.  Maybe we can at least change that bit when <https://letsencrypt.org/> is operational later this year? |

| I think the minimalist position we decided on is that we're not going to be responsible for the user's trust model.  By being in the user's face about it, we make them take an active position about their trust model. Sure, most users will flip on `verify_SSL` without thought, but then it's *their own* decision to expose themselves to hacked [CA's issuing fraudulent certs](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2392063%2C00.asp). (amended to note that was an example of hacking, not incompetent CAs)  Maybe we should move that up in the docs. Blind trust is a form of security theater, so we don't want to default people into that. |

| I'm having a hard time understanding that non-verification of SSL is the good default because blind trust is a bad thing, because skipping SSL verification actually sounds more of a blind trust, from the user's point of view.  If that's the goal you're trying to achieve, requiring verify\_SSL (either 0 or 1, there's no default) sounds like more correct thing to do, since from the look of the code `HTTP::Tiny->new->get("https://example.com")` you can't tell if the request is secure or not.  Note that i'm not actually suggesting that fix above, I still think enabling SSL verification by default (by looking at the host SSL certificate location or `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment), then warn if they're not found, is a better default. |

| It's even worse to default to "verify" but fallback with a warning. That's like BACKRONYM for mysql (albeit at the cert name level rather than the TLS level).  Either verification has to be on and enforced, or off.  If it helps with understanding, the difference is between these:   * "warning: we don't promise any trust" * "just trust us and by extension trust whatever CAs we find"   We don't require people to use SSL. Users choose to provide an https URL. We don't require server name verification. Users choose to set `verify_SSL`. We don't require an explicit CA file. Users choose to set one.  Everything is opt-in.  I would feel differently if this was a browser, but it's just a very low-level protocol library. Anything user-facing that uses it can opt into whatever trust model it wants to offer to users. |

"Who decides" can be a tricky question.

Several organizations issue CVEs, like Red Hat and Gentoo. A bug
usually has to meet a criteria, like falling into a CWE category, to
be issued by the organization.

You can also get them from Mitre's site. In the case of Mitre, it is
the person who requests the CVE.

Some CVE's are tenuous or questionable. You often see this from folks
trying to pad their resume. For example, a researcher may request a
CVE for a behavior that requires elevated privileges. In this case,
someone who is Root on Linux or Administrator on Windows can already
do the damage, so the behavior in question that happens with
privileges is not really interesting.

In the case of HTTP::Tiny, the default configuration and behavior is
running afoul of <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html> and
<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html>. In this case, the
industry believes comms should use HTTPS and the name hostname should
be validated.

Subject: Perl's HTTP::Tiny has insecure TLS cert default, affecting CPAN.pm
 and other modules

HTTP::Tiny v0.082, a Perl core module since v5.13.9 and available
standalone on CPAN, does not verify TLS certs by default. Users must
opt-in with the verify_SSL=>1 flag to verify certs when using HTTPS.

We grepped trough CPAN to find distributions using HTTP::Tiny that
didn't specify cert verification behaviour, possibly exposing users to
mitm attacks. Here are some examples with patches:

- CPAN.pm v2.34 downloads and executes code from <https://cpan.org>
  without verifying server certs. Fixed in v2.35-TRIAL.
  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/9c98370287f4e709924aee7c58ef21c85289a7f0>

- GitLab::API::v4 v0.26 exposes API secrets to a network attacker.
  <https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/pull/57>

- Finance::Robinhood v0.21 is maybe exposing API secrets and financial
  information to a network attacker.
  <https://github.com/sanko/Finance-Robinhood/pull/6>

- Paws (aws-sdk-perl) v0.44 is maybe exposing API secrets to a network
  attacker.
  <https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/pull/426>

- CloudHealth::API v0.01 is maybe exposing API secrets to a network
  attacker.
  <https://github.com/pplu/cloudhealth-api-perl/pull/2>

... and more. We have generated a list of over 300 potentially affected
CPAN distributions.
