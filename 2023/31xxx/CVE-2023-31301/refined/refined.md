The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31301.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login form's username field within the Cash Point & Transport Optimizer (CPTO) application. Specifically, a JavaScript payload can be injected into the username field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected JavaScript payload is stored and later executed when an administrator views the application log. This log displays authentication attempts, including invalid and blacklisted usernames where the injected script is rendered and executed.
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79): The application fails to sanitize the username input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
- The injected script will execute in the context of an administrator viewing the application log.
- The execution of malicious JavaScript code within the administrator's session can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login form of the CPTO application.
- An unauthenticated user enters a malicious JavaScript payload into the username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the CPTO application.
- No authentication is required to inject the malicious payload into the username field.
