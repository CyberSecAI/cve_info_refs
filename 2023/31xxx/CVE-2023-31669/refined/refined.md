{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2023-31669",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a parsing error in the wabt's wat2wasm tool when processing specific input that contains an '@' symbol directly before a quote (\").",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `WastLexer::GetText` function lacks a bounds check which leads to out of bounds read when an offset is earlier than token_start. This occurs when the `GetStringToken` finds a newline and resets token_start.",
       "The `GetIdToken` function skips initial character of an annotation delimiter. It should not be skipped since it is part of `idchar+` which is not an `id token`.",
      "The `WastParser` does not properly handle EOF when reading the end of an annotation."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a crash in `libc++abi.dylib`, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can craft a malicious `.wat` file containing the specific sequence of characters ('@' before a quote) and then use the `wat2wasm` tool to trigger the crash."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute the `wat2wasm` tool and provide the malicious input file."
  },
  "additional_details": {
     "fix_details": "The fix involved adding a bounds check in `WastLexer::GetText`, revising `GetIdToken` to `GetIdChars` to not skip the initial char in an annotation delimiter and fixing WastParser to handle EOF when reading for the end of an annotation."
