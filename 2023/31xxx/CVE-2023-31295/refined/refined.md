- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input in the user profile field before exporting it to a CSV file. Specifically, it fails to neutralize formula elements, allowing spreadsheet software to interpret certain characters as formulas.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSV Injection (CWE-1236 - Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File)
- **Impact of exploitation**: When a user exports a CSV file containing the injected formula and opens it with spreadsheet software, the formula executes, potentially allowing an attacker to perform malicious actions on the victim's computer. This can include arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting a specially crafted payload containing spreadsheet formulas into the "User Profile" field of the application. When the data is exported to a CSV file and opened by the victim, the injected formula is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the application to modify the "User Profile" field.
