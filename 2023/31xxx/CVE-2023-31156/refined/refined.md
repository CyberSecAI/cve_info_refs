Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-31156:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31156

**Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

**Affected Product:** Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Real-Time Automation Controller (SEL RTAC) Web Interface

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the web interface of the SEL RTAC not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit could enable a remote authenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary script code within a user's browser session when they access the affected web interface.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover:** This could potentially lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the victim user.
*  **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker may be able to access sensitive data if not protected.
*   **Manipulation of Web Pages:** The attacker can alter the content and behavior of the web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is located in the web interface of the SEL RTAC.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker would craft malicious input containing the XSS payload and submit it through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the SEL RTAC web interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable SEL RTAC device.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is one of many similar XSS vulnerabilities identified in the SEL RTAC Web Interface, as indicated by the numerous adjacent CVEs in the list (CVE-2023-31149 through CVE-2023-31160, and others)
* The specific details on which input parameters or pages are vulnerable is not available here.
* The document mentions a "SEL Service Bulletin dated 2022-11-15" that contains more details, which is not included here.
