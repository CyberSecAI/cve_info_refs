{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered due to an attempt to allocate an extremely large memory block using JavaScript APIs (specifically SharedArrayBuffer.slice() and ArrayBuffer). The AddressSanitizer reports an out-of-memory error during this allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
      "Lack of proper memory allocation limits",
      "Insufficient validation of array/buffer size requests"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion. The program crashes, preventing normal operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Execution of crafted JavaScript code"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the JerryScript environment"
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided test cases demonstrate two distinct scenarios that cause the out-of-memory condition. One uses SharedArrayBuffer.slice() and the other ArrayBuffer and Uint32Array constructor. These scenarios highlight a weakness in how JerryScript handles large memory allocations."
