{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses the `file_put_contents` function with a user-controlled path from the GET parameter `finish` and user-controlled content from the POST parameter `textAreaCode` without sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file write vulnerability, allows writing arbitrary content to any location accessible by the web server, limited by filesystem permissions and webserver configuration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by writing a malicious PHP file (web shell) and subsequently accessing it through the webserver.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/wcms/wex/html.php` with `finish` parameter and POST request with `textAreaCode` parameter",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server. No prior authentication is required."
