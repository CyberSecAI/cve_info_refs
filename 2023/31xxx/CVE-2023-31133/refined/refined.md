Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31133:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the filtering layer of the Ghost content API. This allowed attackers to filter on private author fields (such as password and email) which should not be exposed publicly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object References:** The API did not properly restrict access to sensitive author fields when filtering.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The filtering logic failed to sanitize or reject filter queries that targeted sensitive fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could use a brute-force technique to reveal private fields (email and password) of authors by repeatedly filtering with different values. The "starts with" operator was particularly dangerous. By trying combinations, attackers could identify the first character, then the second, and so on until the full value was retrieved. This allowed for a complete data leak of email and password fields

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the public API endpoints `/ghost/api/content/*`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges are required. The attacker can be unauthenticated and simply send crafted requests.
- The attacker needs to know that the target instance uses a vulnerable version of Ghost (below v5.46.1).
- The attacker needs to craft API requests that use the `filter` query parameter to target the `password` or `email` fields of authors.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Ghost version 5.46.1.
- A workaround is provided, which suggests blocking requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` when the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.
- The vulnerability is rated as **High** with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The commit diff shows the code changes made to fix the vulnerability. The `rejectPrivateFieldsTransformer` function was introduced to remove filtering on password and email fields.
- Test cases were added to prevent regressions, and verify that filtering by email/password is not allowed.
- The vulnerability was reported by "cpaczek".
