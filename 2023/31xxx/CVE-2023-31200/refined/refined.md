The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31200.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The PTC Vuforia Studio application does not require a token for requests, making it susceptible to cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the absence of token validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform a cross-site request forgery attack and replay requests, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the application if the targeted user has the required privileges.

**Attack vectors:** The attack can be launched remotely and requires the attacker to have high privileges. The attack also requires user interaction. The low complexity also increases the chance of exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the machine or have an ability to induce a user to perform actions that lead to CSRF.
