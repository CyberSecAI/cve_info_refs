- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `lexer_compare_identifier_to_chars` function within the JerryScript engine's lexer due to incorrect handling of specific character sequences during parsing of class definitions with private static async fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application (jerryscript interpreter) and potentially arbitrary code execution, due to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by parsing specifically crafted JavaScript code that includes class definitions with private static async fields using certain character sequences such as `#static async''` and `#static async*''`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable JavaScript code as input to the JerryScript interpreter to trigger the vulnerability.
