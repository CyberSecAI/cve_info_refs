Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an assertion failure within the JerryScript parser, specifically when parsing nested class declarations. The `scope_stack_size` exceeds `PARSER_MAXIMUM_DEPTH_OF_SCOPE_STACK`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** Although not directly stated as a stack overflow, the assertion failure indicates that the parser's scope stack is growing beyond its intended limit. This could be exploited to cause a denial of service.
- **Lack of proper handling for nested classes:** The parser does not correctly handle deeply nested class declarations, leading to the assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the JerryScript interpreter due to a failed assertion, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript code containing nested class declarations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject or provide the malicious JavaScript code to be executed by the JerryScript interpreter.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific location of the assertion failure is at `jerryscript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-expr.c(parser_parse_class):1068`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code is:
```javascript
class v0 {
  v1 = class v2 {  }
}
```
- This triggers the assertion when the parser attempts to handle the nested class declaration.
