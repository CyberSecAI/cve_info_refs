Currently empty epochs are not sealed. This allows an attacker to truncate a sealed log and continue it without any problems showing when verifying the log.

This partially addresses [CVE-2023-31438](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m3qw-f5f6-m6r3 "CVE-2023-31438"). One way to extend this change to address [CVE-2023-31438](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m3qw-f5f6-m6r3 "CVE-2023-31438") completely, would be to verify that there is exactly one seal per epoch (and not sealing when the epoch has not ended yet). I didn't remove the premature sealing, as it is implemented purposefully although I don't understand the purpose.

See <https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf> for more background.

This change adjusts what journald writes into a log file but is compatible in the sense that old `journalctl` versions will successfully verify new journals, but the new `journalctl --verify` will refuse to accept a journal created with old journald if there are gaps in the sealed epochs.

so this check will fail for old journal files (simply because they weren't sealed once per epoch), which I am not sure how friendly that is...

journal files have this compat feature flag thing (look for HEADER\_COMPATIBLE\_xyz in src/libsystemd/sd-journal/journal-def.h). I think it would make sense to add a new flag there, that marks files with complete epochs. Based on this flag we'd switch between making this logic fatal or just a warning. i.e. if the flag is set (which we'd unconditionally do for all files we write) we'd make any missing epoch seals fatal as your patch currently does. But if the flag is not set we'd instead say "This is an old file, seals have holes, blabla, can't make claims of completeness", or so.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Good idea. I added a draft version of a `SEALED_CONTINOUS`-flag to change the error message to a warning. Thinking more closely about it: We cannot guarantee completeness for old journal files regardless of whether the epochs are continuous or not, due to the fact that journald seals an epoch prematurely when closed. Because that allows an attacker to drop the second seal, when the epoch actually ended, and claim the premature seal is the only correct one.  So I think we should drop premature sealing and then this should be the behavior: When not `SEALED_CONTINOUS` we should issue a warning, that we cannot guarantee consistency, unconditionally. (And for the rest of the verification, fall back to verifying the more loose constraint).  Would you be fine with dropping premature sealing, that is this block:   [systemd/src/journal/managed-journal-file.c](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/1ffa5cfb38b3d30d269259c531300fc629816ea9/src/journal/managed-journal-file.c#L395)  Line 395 in [1ffa5cf](/systemd/systemd/commit/1ffa5cfb38b3d30d269259c531300fc629816ea9)   |  | if (JOURNAL\_HEADER\_SEALED(f->file->header) && journal\_file\_writable(f->file)) { | | --- | --- |     or can you tell my why it is needed? |

Several cosmetic issues.

Please check that it is positive before the decrement, to avoid underflow.

Ooh yes, this is a problem for "legacy" verification. However for continuous verification, the underflow is intended and necessary. Let's see how we can adjust the conditions so we fit all corner cases. Currently the check/access to `last_epoch` are:

* initialized to zero
* when a tag occurs:
  + in "continuous mode", the tag must be the first tag or the epoch must be `last_epoch + 1`
  + in "legacy mode", the epoch must be equal or larger than `last_epoch`
  + in both cases: `last_epoch` is set to the epoch (or one less for continuous mode)

Journals (immediately after key generation) "usually" start with epoch 0, because the tag for the header is duplicated the only valid sequence in continuous mode is: 0, 0, 1, 2, 3; and, if rotation happens now, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the next file.

For "legacy" mode, also 0, 0, 1, 5, 6; rotate; 6, 6, 7, 8 is allowed. So maybe we should keep `last_epoch` untouched (i.e. drop line 1242) and make the check more complex:

`! (n_tags == 0 || (n_tags == 1 && le64toh(o->tag.epoch) == last_epoch) || le64toh(o->tag.epoch) == last_epoch + 1)`

of course that condition could be split up if that makes it easier to digest:

```
if(n_tags == 0) {
    // Pass
} else if (n_tags == 1) {
    if (le64toh(o->tag.epoch) != last_epoch) {
        // log error
        goto fail;
    }
} else if (le64toh(o->tag.epoch) == last_epoch + 1) {
    // log error
    goto fail;
}

```

what's your opinion on those two options?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Sorry, still I am not familiar with details about tagging. I just commented that for general coding nitpicks. Feel free to take a way you think that should be appropriate here. Hopefully [@poettering](https://github.com/poettering) and/or others will take final review later.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Three Vulnerabilities in Journald Forward Secure Log Sealing

This repository contains the accompanying code for the publication "Secure Logging in between Theory and Practice: Security Analysis of the Implementation of Forward Secure Log Sealing in Journald" ([in this repository](/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf) or [on eprint](https://ia.cr/2023/867)). For details on the individual vulnerabilities and theoretical background we refer to the publication.
The three vulnerabilities mentioned are:

## [CVE-2023-31439](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31439)

This vulnerability allows forging arbitrary logs. This vulnerability is caused by a missing check. A patch suggestion is available in [CVE-2023-31439.patch](/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/CVE-2023-31439.patch).

## [CVE-2023-31438](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31438)

This vulnerability allows unnoticed truncation of logs. It can be partly mitigated by [CVE-2023-31438-incomplete.patch](/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/CVE-2023-31438-incomplete.patch).

## [CVE-2023-31437](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31437)

This vulnerability allows hiding some log entries from log output displayed using filters like `journalctl -u "systemd-*.service"`.

This project can be built and imported into an IDE as a regular gradle project.

The attack described in the publication can be reproduced by running [`Attacker.main`](/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/src/main/java/journald/Attacker.java#L23).
To use a different systemd implementation as target, adjust [`JournalSystem#createInstance`](/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/src/main/java/journald/JournalSystem.java#L170) and provide the path to the desired build directory in there.

[systemd v257](/systemd/systemd/releases/tag/v257)

# CHANGES WITH 257:

## Incompatible changes:

```
    * The --purge switch of systemd-tmpfiles (which was added in v256) has
      been reworked: it will now only apply to tmpfiles.d/ lines marked
      with the new "$" flag. This is an incompatible change, and means any
      tmpfiles.d/ files which shall be used together with --purge need to
      be updated accordingly. This change has been made to make it harder
      to accidentally delete too many files when using --purge incorrectly.

    * The systemd-creds 'cat' verb now expects base64-encoded encrypted
      credentials as input, for consistency with the 'decrypt' verb and the
      LoadCredentialEncrypted= service setting. Previously it could only
      read raw, unencoded binary data.

    * Support for automatic flushing of the nscd user/group database caches
      has been dropped.

    * The FileDescriptorName= setting for socket units is now honored by
      Accept=yes sockets too, where it was previously silently ignored and
      "connection" was used unconditionally.

    * systemd-logind now always obeys block inhibitor locks, where previously
      it ignored locks taken by the caller or when the caller was root. A
      privileged caller can always close the other sessions, remove the
      inhibitor locks, or use --force or --check-inhibitors=no to ignore the
      inhibitors. This change thus doesn't affect security, since everything
      that was possible before at a given privilege level is still possible,
      but it should make the inhibitor logic easier to use and understand,
      and also help avoiding accidental reboots and shutdowns. New 'block-weak'
      inhibitor modes were added, if taken they will make the inhibitor lock
      work as in the previous versions. Inhibitor locks can also be taken by
      remote users (subject to polkit policy).

    * systemd-nspawn will now mount the unified cgroup hierarchy into a
      container if no systemd installation is found in a container's root
      filesystem. $SYSTEMD_NSPAWN_UNIFIED_HIERARCHY=0 can be used to override
      this behavior.

    * /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-* block device symlinks without an NVMe
      namespace identifier are now fixed to namespace 1 of the device. If
      no namespace 1 exists for a device no such symlink is
      created. Previously, these symlinks would point to an unspecified
      namespace, and thus not be strictly stable references to
      multi-namespace NVMe devices. These un-namespaced symlinks are mostly
      obsolete, users and applications should always use the ones with
      encoded namespace information instead. This change should not affect
      too many systems, because most NVMe devices only know a namespace 1
      by default.

    * Support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid' hierarchies) is now
      considered obsolete and systemd by default will ignore configuration
      that enables them. To forcibly reenable cgroup v1 support,
      SYSTEMD_CGROUP_ENABLE_LEGACY_FORCE=1 must additionally be set on the
      kernel command line.

```
## Announcements of Future Feature Removals:

```
    * The D-Bus method org.freedesktop.systemd1.StartAuxiliaryScope() is
      deprecated because accounting data and such cannot be reasonably
      migrated between cgroups. It is likely to be fully removed in a
      future release (reach out if you have use cases).

    * The recommended kernel baseline version has been bumped to v5.4
      (released in 2019). Expect limited testing on older kernel versions,
      where "old-kernel" taint flag would also be set. Support for them
      will be phased out in a future release in 2025, i.e. we expect to bump
      the minimum baseline to v5.4 then too.

    * The complete removal of support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid'
      hierarchies) is scheduled for v258.

    * Support for System V service scripts is deprecated and will be
      removed in v258. Please make sure to update your software
      *now* to include a native systemd unit file instead of a legacy
      System V script to retain compatibility with future systemd releases.

    * To work around limitations of X11's keyboard handling systemd's
      keyboard mapping hardware database (hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb) so far
      mapped the microphone mute and touchpad on/off/toggle keys to the
      function keys F20, F21, F22, F23 instead of their correct key codes.
      This key code mangling will be removed in the next systemd release.
      To maintain compatibility with X11 applications that rely on the old
      function key code mappings, this mangling has now been moved to the
      relevant X11 keyboard driver modules. In order to ensure these keys
      continue to work, update to xf86-input-evdev >= 2.11.0 and
      xf86-input-libinput >= 1.5.0 before updating to systemd >= 258.

    * Support for the SystemdOptions EFI variable is deprecated.
      'bootctl systemd-efi-options' will emit a warning when used. It seems
      that this feature is little-used and it is better to use alternative
      approaches like credentials and confexts. The plan is to drop support
      altogether at a later point, but this might be revisited based on
      user feedback.

    * systemd-run's switch --expand-environment= which currently is disabled
      by default when combined with --scope, will be changed in a future
      release to be enabled by default.

```
## libsystemd:

```
    * systemd's JSON API is now available as public interface of
      libsystemd, under the name "sd-json". The purpose of the library is
      to allow structures to be conveniently created in C code and
      serialized to JSON, and for JSON to be conveniently deserialized into
      in-memory structures, using callbacks to handle specific
      keys. Various data types like integers, floats, booleans, strings,
      UUIDs, base64-encoded and hex-encoded binary data, and arrays are
      supported natively. The library has been part of systemd for a while
      as internal component, and is now made publicly available. One major
      user of sd-json is sd-varlink (see below). Note that the
      documentation of sd-json is very much incomplete for now, but the
      systemd codebase provides plenty real-life code examples.

    * systemd's Varlink IPC API is now available as part of libsystemd,
      under the name "sd-varlink". This library is a C implementation of
      the Varlink IPC system (https://varlink.org/) that has been adopted
      by systemd for various interfaces. It relies on the sd-json JSON
      component, see above. Note that the documentation of sd-varlink is
      very much incomplete for now, but the systemd codebase provides
      plenty real-life code examples.

    * sd-bus gained a new call sd_bus_pending_method_calls() which returns
      the number of currently open asynchronous method calls initiated on
      this connection towards peers.

    * sd-device gained a new call sd_device_monitor_is_running() that
      returns whether the specified monitor object is already running. It
      also gained sd_device_monitor_get_fd(),
      sd_device_monitor_get_events(), sd_device_monitor_get_timeout() and
      sd_device_monitor_receive() to permit sd-device to run on top of a
      foreign event loop implementation. It also gained
      sd_device_get_driver_subsystem() which returns the subsystem of
      driver objects. The new sd_device_get_device_id() call returns a
      short string identifying the device record.

```
## System and Service Management:

```
    * The environment variable $REMOTE_ADDR is now set when using
      per-connection socket activation for AF_UNIX stream sockets. It
      contains the AF_UNIX peer address of the connection. (Previously the
      environment variable was only set for IP sockets.)

    * Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is now supported as a socket protocol for
      .socket units.

    * A new /etc/fstab option x-systemd.wants= creates "Wants="
      dependencies.  (This is similar to the previously available
      x-systemd.requires=.)

    * The initialization of the system clock during boot and updates has
      been simplified: both PID 1 or systemd-timesyncd will pick the latest
      minimum time as indicated by the compiled-in epoch,
      /usr/lib/clock-epoch, and /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock. See
      systemd(1) for an detailed updated description.

    * The kernel's Ctrl-Alt-Delete handling is re-enabled during late
      shutdown, so that the user may use it to initiate a reboot if the
      system freezes otherwise.

    * The new value "identity" for the unit setting PrivateUsers= may be
      used to request a user namespace with an identity mapping for the
      first 65536 UIDs/GIDs.  This is analogous to the systemd-nspawn's
      --private-users=identity.

    * The new value "disconnected" for the unit setting PrivateTmp= may be
      used to specify that a separate tmpfs instance should be used for
      /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ for the unit.

    * The server manager (and various other tools too) use pidfds in more
      places to refer to processes.

    * A build option -D link-executor-shared=false can be used to build
      the systemd-executor binary...

# CHANGES WITH 257 in spe:

## Incompatible changes:

```
    * The --purge switch of systemd-tmpfiles (which was added in v256) has
      been reworked: it will now only apply to tmpfiles.d/ lines marked
      with the new "$" flag. This is an incompatible change, and means any
      tmpfiles.d/ files which shall be used together with --purge need to
      be updated accordingly. This change has been made to make it harder
      to accidentally delete too many files when using --purge incorrectly.

    * The systemd-creds 'cat' verb now expects base64-encoded encrypted
      credentials as input, for consistency with the 'decrypt' verb and the
      LoadCredentialEncrypted= service setting. Previously it could only
      read raw, unencoded binary data.

    * Support for automatic flushing of the nscd user/group database caches
      has been dropped.

    * The FileDescriptorName= setting for socket units is now honored by
      Accept=yes sockets too, where it was previously silently ignored and
      "connection" was used unconditionally.

    * systemd-logind now always obeys block inhibitor locks, where previously
      it ignored locks taken by the caller or when the caller was root. A
      privileged caller can always close the other sessions, remove the
      inhibitor locks, or use --force or --check-inhibitors=no to ignore the
      inhibitors. This change thus doesn't affect security, since everything
      that was possible before at a given privilege level is still possible,
      but it should make the inhibitor logic easier to use and understand,
      and also help avoiding accidental reboots and shutdowns. New 'block-weak'
      inhibitor modes were added, if taken they will make the inhibitor lock
      work as in the previous versions. Inhibitor locks can also be taken by
      remote users (subject to polkit policy).

    * systemd-nspawn will now mount the unified cgroup hierarchy into a
      container if no systemd installation is found in a container's root
      filesystem. $SYSTEMD_NSPAWN_UNIFIED_HIERARCHY=0 can be used to override
      this behavior.

    * /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-* block device symlinks without an NVMe
      namespace identifier are now fixed to namespace 1 of the device. If
      no namespace 1 exists for a device no such symlink is
      created. Previously, these symlinks would point to an unspecified
      namespace, and thus not be strictly stable references to
      multi-namespace NVMe devices. These un-namespaced symlinks are mostly
      obsolete, users and applications should always use the ones with
      encoded namespace information instead. This change should not affect
      too many systems, because most NVMe devices only know a namespace 1
      by default.

    * Support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid' hierarchies) is now
      considered obsolete and systemd by default will ignore configuration
      that enables them. To forcibly reenable cgroup v1 support,
      SYSTEMD_CGROUP_ENABLE_LEGACY_FORCE=1 must additionally be set on the
      kernel command line.

```
## Announcements of Future Feature Removals:

```
    * The D-Bus method org.freedesktop.systemd1.StartAuxiliaryScope() is
      deprecated because accounting data and such cannot be reasonably
      migrated between cgroups. It is likely to be fully removed in a
      future release (reach out if you have use cases).

    * The recommended kernel baseline version has been bumped to v5.4
      (released in 2019). Expect limited testing on older kernel versions,
      where "old-kernel" taint flag would also be set. Support for them
      will be phased out in a future release in 2025, i.e. we expect to bump
      the minimum baseline to v5.4 then too.

    * The complete removal of support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid'
      hierarchies) is scheduled for v258.

    * Support for System V service scripts is deprecated and will be
      removed in v258. Please make sure to update your software
      *now* to include a native systemd unit file instead of a legacy
      System V script to retain compatibility with future systemd releases.

    * To work around limitations of X11's keyboard handling systemd's
      keyboard mapping hardware database (hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb) so far
      mapped the microphone mute and touchpad on/off/toggle keys to the
      function keys F20, F21, F22, F23 instead of their correct key codes.
      This key code mangling will be removed in the next systemd release.
      To maintain compatibility with X11 applications that rely on the old
      function key code mappings, this mangling has now been moved to the
      relevant X11 keyboard driver modules. In order to ensure these keys
      continue to work, update to xf86-input-evdev >= 2.11.0 and
      xf86-input-libinput >= 1.5.0 before updating to systemd >= 258.

    * Support for the SystemdOptions EFI variable is deprecated.
      'bootctl systemd-efi-options' will emit a warning when used. It seems
      that this feature is little-used and it is better to use alternative
      approaches like credentials and confexts. The plan is to drop support
      altogether at a later point, but this might be revisited based on
      user feedback.

    * systemd-run's switch --expand-environment= which currently is disabled
      by default when combined with --scope, will be changed in a future
      release to be enabled by default.

```
## libsystemd:

```
    * systemd's JSON API is now available as public interface of
      libsystemd, under the name "sd-json". The purpose of the library is
      to allow structures to be conveniently created in C code and
      serialized to JSON, and for JSON to be conveniently deserialized into
      in-memory structures, using callbacks to handle specific
      keys. Various data types like integers, floats, booleans, strings,
      UUIDs, base64-encoded and hex-encoded binary data, and arrays are
      supported natively. The library has been part of systemd for a while
      as internal component, and is now made publicly available. One major
      user of sd-json is sd-varlink (see below). Note that the
      documentation of sd-json is very much incomplete for now, but the
      systemd codebase provides plenty real-life code examples.

    * systemd's Varlink IPC API is now available as part of libsystemd,
      under the name "sd-varlink". This library is a C implementation of
      the Varlink IPC system (https://varlink.org/) that has been adopted
      by systemd for various interfaces. It relies on the sd-json JSON
      component, see above. Note that the documentation of sd-varlink is
      very much incomplete for now, but the systemd codebase provides
      plenty real-life code examples.

    * sd-bus gained a new call sd_bus_pending_method_calls() which returns
      the number of currently open asynchronous method calls initiated on
      this connection towards peers.

    * sd-device gained a new call sd_device_monitor_is_running() that
      returns whether the specified monitor object is already running. It
      also gained sd_device_monitor_get_fd(),
      sd_device_monitor_get_events(), sd_device_monitor_get_timeout() and
      sd_device_monitor_receive() to permit sd-device to run on top of a
      foreign event loop implementation. It also gained
      sd_device_get_driver_subsystem() which returns the subsystem of
      driver objects. The new sd_device_get_device_id() call returns a
      short string identifying the device record.

```
## System and Service Management:

```
    * The environment variable $REMOTE_ADDR is now set when using
      per-connection socket activation for AF_UNIX stream sockets. It
      contains the AF_UNIX peer address of the connection. (Previously the
      environment variable was only set for IP sockets.)

    * Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is now supported as a socket protocol for
      .socket units.

    * A new /etc/fstab option x-systemd.wants= creates "Wants="
      dependencies.  (This is similar to the previously available
      x-systemd.requires=.)

    * The initialization of the system clock during boot and updates has
      been simplified: both PID 1 or systemd-timesyncd will pick the latest
      minimum time as indicated by the compiled-in epoch,
      /usr/lib/clock-epoch, and /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock. See
      systemd(1) for an detailed updated description.

    * The kernel's Ctrl-Alt-Delete handling is re-enabled during late
      shutdown, so that the user may use it to initiate a reboot if the
      system freezes otherwise.

    * The new value "identity" for the unit setting PrivateUsers= may be
      used to request a user namespace with an identity mapping for the
      first 65536 UIDs/GIDs.  This is analogous to the systemd-nspawn's
      --private-users=identity.

    * The new value "disconnected" for the unit setting PrivateTmp= may be
      used to specify that a separate tmpfs instance should be used for
      /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ for the unit.

    * The server manager (and various other tools too) use pidfds in more
      places to refer to processes.

    * A build option -D link-executor-shared=false can be used to build
      the systemd-execu...

      inhibitors. This change thus doesn't affect security, since everything
      that was possible before at a given privilege level is still possible,
      but it should make the inhibitor logic easier to use and understand,
      and also help avoiding accidental reboots and shutdowns. New 'block-weak'
      inhibitor modes were added, if taken they will make the inhibitor lock
      work as in the previous versions. Inhibitor locks can also be taken by
      remote users (subject to polkit policy).

    * systemd-nspawn will now mount the unified cgroup hierarchy into a
      container if no systemd installation is found in a container's root
      filesystem. $SYSTEMD_NSPAWN_UNIFIED_HIERARCHY=0 can be used to override
      this behavior.

    * /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-* block device symlinks without an NVMe
      namespace identifier are now fixed to namespace 1 of the device. If
      no namespace 1 exists for a device no such symlink is
      created. Previously, these symlinks would point to an unspecified
      namespace, and thus not be strictly stable references to
      multi-namespace NVMe devices. These un-namespaced symlinks are mostly
      obsolete, users and applications should always use the ones with
      encoded namespace information instead. This change should not affect
      too many systems, because most NVMe devices only know a namespace 1
      by default.

    * Support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid' hierarchies) is now
      considered obsolete and systemd by default will ignore configuration
      that enables them. To forcibly reenable cgroup v1 support,
      SYSTEMD_CGROUP_ENABLE_LEGACY_FORCE=1 must additionally be set on the
      kernel command line.

```
## Announcements of Future Feature Removals:

```
    * The D-Bus method org.freedesktop.systemd1.StartAuxiliaryScope() is
      deprecated because accounting data and such cannot be reasonably
      migrated between cgroups. It is likely to be fully removed in a
      future release (reach out if you have use cases).

    * The recommended kernel baseline version has been bumped to v5.4
      (released in 2019). Expect limited testing on older kernel versions,
      where "old-kernel" taint flag would also be set. Support for them
      will be phased out in a future release in 2025, i.e. we expect to bump
      the minimum baseline to v5.4 then too.

    * The complete removal of support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid'
      hierarchies) is scheduled for v258.

    * Support for System V service scripts is deprecated and will be
      removed in v258. Please make sure to update your software
      *now* to include a native systemd unit file instead of a legacy
      System V script to retain compatibility with future systemd releases.

    * To work around limitations of X11's keyboard handling systemd's
      keyboard mapping hardware database (hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb) so far
      mapped the microphone mute and touchpad on/off/toggle keys to the
      function keys F20, F21, F22, F23 instead of their correct key
      codes. This key code mangling will be removed in the next systemd
      release v258. To maintain compatibility with X11 applications that
      rely on the old function key code mappings, this mangling has now
      been moved to the relevant X11 keyboard driver modules instead. Thus,
      in order to ensure these keys continue to work as before, make sure
      to update the xf86-input-evdev and xf86-input-libinput packages to
      the newest version before updating systemd to v258.

    * Support for the SystemdOptions EFI variable is deprecated.
      'bootctl systemd-efi-options' will emit a warning when used. It seems
      that this feature is little-used and it is better to use alternative
      approaches like credentials and confexts. The plan is to drop support
      altogether at a later point, but this might be revisited based on
      user feedback.

    * systemd-run's switch --expand-environment= which currently is disabled
      by default when combined with --scope, will be changed in a future
      release to be enabled by default.

```
## libsystemd:

```
    * systemd's JSON API is now available as public interface of
      libsystemd, under the name "sd-json". The purpose of the library is
      to allow structures to be conveniently created in C code and
      serialized to JSON, and for JSON to be conveniently deserialized into
      in-memory structures, using callbacks to handle specific
      keys. Various data types like integers, floats, booleans, strings,
      UUIDs, base64-encoded and hex-encoded binary data, and arrays are
      supported natively. The library has been part of systemd for a while
      as internal component, and is now made publicly available. One major
      user of sd-json is sd-varlink (see below). Note that the
      documentation of sd-json is very much incomplete for now, but the
      systemd codebase provides plenty real-life code examples.

    * systemd's Varlink IPC API is now available as part of libsystemd,
      under the name "sd-varlink". This library is a C implementation of
      the Varlink IPC system (https://varlink.org/) that has been adopted
      by systemd for various interfaces. It relies on the sd-json JSON
      component, see above. Note that the documentation of sd-varlink is
      very much incomplete for now, but the systemd codebase provides
      plenty real-life code examples.

    * sd-bus gained a new call sd_bus_pending_method_calls() which returns
      the number of currently open asynchronous method calls initiated on
      this connection towards peers.

    * sd-device gained a new call sd_device_monitor_is_running() that
      returns whether the specified monitor object is already running. It
      also gained sd_device_monitor_get_fd(),
      sd_device_monitor_get_events(), sd_device_monitor_get_timeout() and
      sd_device_monitor_receive() to permit sd-device to run on top of a
      foreign event loop implementation. It also gained
      sd_device_get_driver_subsystem() which returns the subsystem of
      driver objects. The new sd_device_get_device_id() call returns a
      short string identifying the device record.

```
## System and Service Management:

```
    * The environment variable $REMOTE_ADDR is now set when using
      per-connection socket activation for AF_UNIX stream sockets. It
      contains the AF_UNIX peer address of the connection. (Previously the
      environment variable was only set for IP sockets.)

    * Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is now supported as a socket protocol for
      .socket units.

    * A new /etc/fstab option x-systemd.wants= creates "Wants="
      dependencies.  (This is similar to the previously available
      x-systemd.requires=.)

    * The initialization of the system clock during boot and updates has
      been simplified: both PID 1 or systemd-timesyncd will pick the latest
      minimum time as indicated by the compiled-in epoch,
      /usr/lib/clock-epoch, and /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock. See
      systemd(1) for an detailed updated description.

    * The kernel's Ctrl-Alt-Delete handling is re-enabled during late
      shutdown, so that the user may use it to initiate a reboot if the
      system freezes otherwise.

    * The new value "identity" for the unit setting PrivateUsers= may be
      used to request a user namespace with an identity mapping for the
      first 65536 UIDs/GIDs.  This is analogous to the systemd-nspawn's
      --private-users=identity.

    * The new value "disconnected" for the unit setting PrivateTmp= may be
      used to specify that a separate tmpfs instance should be used for
      /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ for the unit.

    * The server manager (and various other tools too) use pidfds in more
      places to refer to processes.

    * A build option -D link-executor...
