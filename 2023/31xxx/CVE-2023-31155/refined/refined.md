Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31155

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation". This is also known as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a classic XSS flaw. The web interface of the SEL RTAC does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it in the webpage. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary script code in the web browser of a user accessing the vulnerable interface.
- The impact of this is dependent on the context. The injected script could:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site
    - Potentially cause further damage to the system if the user has elevated privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and requires a valid authenticated session to the SEL RTAC web interface.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL or manipulate other parts of the webpage that are reflecting user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the SEL RTAC web interface with valid credentials.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send requests that will be reflected unsanitized on the webpage.
-   The attacker does not need physical access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is one of several XSS vulnerabilities reported against the SEL RTAC web interface by Nozomi Networks.
- A service bulletin has been issued by SEL dated 2022-11-15 to address this issue.
- The description mentions that the attacker is "remote authenticated" implying that the attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the web interface.
