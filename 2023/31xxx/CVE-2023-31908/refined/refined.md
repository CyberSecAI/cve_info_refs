- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `ecma_builtin_typedarray_prototype_sort` function within JerryScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-buffer-overflow due to improper handling of typed array sorting. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write occurs during the sorting process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided output shows a crash due to the address sanitizer detecting a heap-buffer-overflow. The program aborts as a result of the memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `sort()` method on a specially crafted `Int16Array` object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable JerryScript environment to trigger this issue. The attacker must be able to supply a large typed array, specifically `Int16Array`.
