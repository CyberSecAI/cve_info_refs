Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with Repetier Server, as described by Cybir.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation allows an attacker to include arbitrary files on the web server by manipulating the input.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing file paths.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files (SQL databases), and potentially executable files. In this case, it was used to access a SQL file containing password hashes, API keys, and usernames.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with manipulated file paths in the URL.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Excessive Privileges:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Repetier Server service runs with SYSTEM privileges.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The web server has too many rights, allowing access to protected content.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read any sensitive content from the operating system, leading to full system compromise after the LFI vulnerability is exploited.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Combination with LFI
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to exploit LFI.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) & Host Header Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing CSRF controls and host header validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of anti-CSRF tokens or origin checks, allowing attackers to trick users into performing unwanted actions; the application is also vulnerable to Host header injection, allowing manipulation of the host header in the HTTP request.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can send specially crafted requests on behalf of a user, leading to unintended actions; also host header injection can be used for phishing, cookie theft, and bypassing security controls.
    *    **Attack Vector:**  Sending malicious requests to the server that appears to be from a legitimate user. Manipulating the host header in HTTP requests.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to send malicious HTTP requests.
*    **Plaintext Transmission of Passwords via HTTP GET:**
     *   **Root Cause**: Sending passwords through HTTP GET requests.
     *   **Weaknesses**: Passwords are exposed in clear text within the URL.
     *   **Impact**: Passwords can be intercepted and read, leading to account compromise.
     *   **Attack Vector**: Man-in-the-middle attack.
     *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic.
*    **Missing XSS Filtering Headers & Sanitization Controls**
     *   **Root Cause**: Lack of XSS filter headers
     *   **Weaknesses**: The lack of XSS filtering and sanitization controls in the application
     *   **Impact**: The application is vulnerable to XSS and arbitrary content injection
     *   **Attack Vector**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages
     *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious scripts

**Summary of the information provided by the Cybir article:**
The article provides significantly more details than a typical CVE description, including a proof of concept LFI exploit and explanation of other vulnerabilities like CSRF, host header injection, insecure password transmission, and missing XSS protection. The combination of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to completely compromise the Repetier Server application and potentially the underlying operating system due to the SYSTEM privileges under which the application runs.
