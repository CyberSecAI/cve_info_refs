The AirVantage platform is vulnerable to an unauthorized attacker registering previously unregistered 
devices on the AirVantage platform when the owner has not disabled the AirVantage Management 
Service on the devices or registered the device. This could enable an attacker to configure, manage, 
and execute AT commands on an unsuspecting userâ€™s devices.
