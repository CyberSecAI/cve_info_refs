•  Dynamic health check - Previous versions of the Pro Agent performed a health check every 5

minutes, regardless of the network size. As a result, small networks had a delay when notifying
when the connected state changed. For larger networks, the health check scan may not have
been completed before the next was triggered. This resulted in devices showing as disconnected
when they were functioning as expected. OvrC Pro App version 7.4.0 now waits for the previous
health check to complete before triggering the next one, for a more accurate connected state
reading.

•  MAC address validation — OvrC now validates the MAC address of discovered devices by

matching the device list in the OvrC Pro agent. This provides more accurate monitoring on sites
with frequently changing IP addresses.

•  Removed the OvrC Pro local UI that was previously available on port 60000. All of this

functionality is now available in the OvrC app.

•  Ookla speed tests now allow multiple threads to run simultaneously to achieve faster results.

Fixes

•  Fixed an issue where WebConnect would not work on Onkyo, Integra, Pioneer AVRs
•  Fixed an issue where login credentials and SNMP community names were not being stored.
•  Improved the scan time on the AN-520 router. This is now comparable to the 310 router.
•  Fixed an issue where open files were creating a memory leak on the OvrC Pro agent.

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v4 9.2**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor**: Snap One
* **Equipment**: OvrC Cloud, OvrC Pro Devices
* **Vulnerabilities**: Improper Resource Locking, Observable Response Discrepancy, Unprotected Alternate Channel, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value, Open Redirect, Use of Weak Credentials, Hidden Functionality, Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, Missing Authentication for Critical Function

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate and claim devices, execute arbitrary code, and disclose information about the affected device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Snap One component is affected:

* OvrC Pro: All versions prior to 7.3

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**IMPROPER RESOURCE LOCKING CWE-413**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/413.html)

In Snap One OVRC cloud platform, the Hub is a device that is used to centralize and manage nested devices connected to it. A vulnerability exists where an attacker can impersonate a hub and send device requests to claim already claimed devices. The OVRC cloud platform receives the requests but does not validate if the found devices are already managed by another user.

[CVE-2023-28649](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28649) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2023-28649](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28649). A base score of 9.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H)).

#### **3.2.2** [**OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE-204**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)

When supplying Snap One OVRC cloud servers with a random MAC address, it will return information about the device. The MAC address of devices can be enumerated in an attack and their information will be disclosed by the OVRC cloud.

[CVE-2023-28412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28412) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Uri Katz of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Snap One has released the following updates/fixes for the affected products:

* OvrC Pro v7.2 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.
* OvrC Pro v7.3 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.
* Disable UPnP.

For more information, see Snap One's [Release Notes](https://www.control4.com/docs/product/ovrc-software/release-notes/english/latest/ovrc-software-release-notes-rev-p.pdf).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.
