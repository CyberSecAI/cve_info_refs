The provided content includes information about CVE-2023-31245.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a URL redirection vulnerability, where devices using Snap One OVRC cloud are redirected to a web address using HTTP when accessing a web management interface. Attackers can impersonate a device and supply malicious information, which can then redirect users to arbitrary and potentially dangerous web locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirect: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation or sanitization of the URL parameters used when redirecting users to the web management interface of a device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Redirect users to arbitrary and dangerous locations on the web.
- Possibly facilitate phishing attacks by directing users to fake login pages, or to malicious sites that could infect the user machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can impersonate an OVRC device.
- By supplying malicious URL parameters when the device is accessed, the attacker can redirect the user's browser to an arbitrary URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate the communication between the OVRC device and the user's browser.
- The attacker must also have knowledge of the expected format of the URL parameters and the ability to inject malicious URLs.
- The user needs to be using an HTTP connection for the redirect.

**Additional Details:**

- The CISA advisory assigns CVE-2023-31245 to this vulnerability, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.1 and a CVSS v4 base score of 5.1
- The vulnerability is present in Snap One OVRC cloud, and exploitation requires user interaction.
- It highlights that the devices use HTTP connections to access the web management interfaces, which creates the possibility to conduct this redirect exploit.
