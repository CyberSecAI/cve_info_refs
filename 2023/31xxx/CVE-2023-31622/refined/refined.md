Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A missing check for a table in positioned delete operations within Virtuoso's SQL processing logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code did not properly validate the presence of a table when performing a "DELETE ... WHERE CURRENT OF cursor" operation.
- This missing check allows for a crash when a positioned delete is attempted on a cursor that is not associated with a valid table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a crash of the Virtuoso server, indicating a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a specific SQL query using "DELETE ... WHERE CURRENT OF cursor" against a cursor not related to a table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL queries on the Virtuoso database, which typically requires valid credentials.
- The attacker can execute the crafted SQL query using `isql`, the Virtuoso interactive SQL tool.
- The attacker could potentially be an authenticated user or someone who can inject SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs during the execution of `sqlc_make_policy_trig`, which appears to be a function related to creating triggers based on the policy of the operation. This suggests that the missing table check impacts policy enforcement as well.
- The backtrace provided in the issue comments provides a call stack:
    - `sqlc_make_policy_trig`
    - `sqlc_delete_pos`
    - `sql_stmt_comp`
    - `sql_compile_1`
    - `stmt_set_query`
    - `sf_sql_execute`
    - `sf_sql_execute_w`
    - `sf_sql_execute_wrapper`
    - `future_wrapper`
    - `_thread_boot`
    - `start_thread`
    - `clone`
- The fix for the issue was to add the missing table check within the positioned delete operation, specifically in commit `38e3635`.
- The vulnerability is present in version 7.2.9 of Virtuoso and was found using a DBMS fuzzer.
- The provided PoC uses a query `DELETE FROM ucview WHERE CURRENT OF c1;`, which triggers the crash.
