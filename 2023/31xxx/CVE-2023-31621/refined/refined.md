The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31621.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered when adding a new non-null column to an existing table using `ALTER TABLE` and then performing an `UPDATE` operation on the same table. This operation causes the Virtuoso database to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue lies in how the database handles updates after a non-null column is added to a table with existing data. The `kc_var_col` function appears to be involved in the crash, suggesting a problem with handling variable-length columns after the schema change. The backtrace points to issues in functions involved in row copying, page management, and query execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). Exploiting this vulnerability crashes the Virtuoso database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through SQL queries. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a sequence of SQL statements:
1. Create a table
2. Insert data into the table.
3. Add a new non-null column to the table.
4. Update existing rows in the table after adding the new column.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a Virtuoso database. This likely requires some form of authenticated access or the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries (e.g., SQL injection).
