- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, user-supplied input to the **Barcode** field is not sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage which would be executed when a user interacts with it. This could lead to various attacks including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying content within the affected web application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the **Barcode** field of a container in the CPTO application. An attacker would insert the malicious script into this field. When the **Send** button is pressed, the injected script gets executed in the userâ€™s browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the **Barcode** field within the CPTO application. This likely implies the attacker has access to the CPTO interface as a valid user.
