The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `scanner_literal_is_created` function within the JerryScript parser, triggered when parsing specific JavaScript code involving class definitions and static members.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A write operation occurs beyond the allocated buffer.
- Assertion failure: The code also triggers an assertion failure when run with debugging enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash (as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer error) and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted JavaScript code, the vulnerable `scanner_literal_is_created` function can be triggered leading to the heap-buffer-overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input to the JerryScript engine to parse and execute. This could be through a web page that uses JerryScript, or by directly executing the provided script using the `jerry` binary.
- No special privileges or network access is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
