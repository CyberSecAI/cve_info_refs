The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31568.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in `PoDoFo::PdfEncryptRC4::PdfEncryptRC4` due to an uncontrolled copy of data using `memcpy`. Specifically, the code attempts to copy 32 bytes into `m_oValue` regardless of the actual size of source data `oValue`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `PoDoFo::PdfEncryptRC4::PdfEncryptRC4`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted PDF file with a malformed or invalid `/Encrypt` dictionary that causes the `oValue` to be larger than expected. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the `podofopdfinfo` tool, through `podofopdfinfo poc_file`. The attacker must provide a crafted PDF file as input to `podofopdfinfo`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable software.
The attacker needs to be able to execute the `podofopdfinfo` tool on the malicious file.
