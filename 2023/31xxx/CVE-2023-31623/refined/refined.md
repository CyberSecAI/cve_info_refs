{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The crash occurs due to an issue in the `mp_box_copy` function, which is related to how the system handles updates to views involving expressions, specifically when a view is derived from a table and an UPDATE operation modifies the view using a self-referential column.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The software does not properly handle recursive calls in `sqlc_exp_to_view_scope`, leading to a stack overflow or memory corruption during the execution of the UPDATE statement.",
      "The `mp_box_copy` function might not correctly handle deep copy operations."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability results in a crash of the Virtuoso server, leading to a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted SQL query that includes an UPDATE statement on a view which involves self-referential column operations that triggers a recursion within `sqlc_exp_to_view_scope` function.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the Virtuoso database to trigger this vulnerability."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The issue is resolved by the patch that also addresses issue #1118, with commit ID 2ed10333e6e973c2b3e1e60ba854ef0dd12afe07."
