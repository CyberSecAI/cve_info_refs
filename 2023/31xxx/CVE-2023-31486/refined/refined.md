{
  "CVE-2023-31486": {
    "description": "HTTP::Tiny 0.082, a Perl core module since 5.13.9 and available standalone on CPAN, has an insecure default TLS configuration where users must opt in to verify certificates.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the HTTP::Tiny module in Perl does not verify TLS/SSL connections by default. This means that by default, the module will accept connections to any host, even if the server's certificate is invalid, expired or self-signed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default TLS configuration where users must opt in to verify certificates."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible if the user connects to a malicious server that has an invalid, self-signed or expired certificate. An attacker could intercept and modify traffic between client and server.",
       "A hostile actor on the local network could also perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify traffic."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack on the local network or by compromising a network device."
