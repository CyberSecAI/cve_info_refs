|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | OpenText Documentum Content Server before 23.2 has a flaw that allows |
|  | for privilege escalation from a non-privileged Documentum user to root. |
|  | The software comes prepackaged with a root owned SUID binary |
|  | dm\_secure\_writer. The binary has security controls in place preventing |
|  | creation of a file in a non-owned directory, or as the root user. |
|  | However, these controls can be carefully bypassed to allow for an |
|  | arbitrary file write as root. |
