{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The software comes prepackaged with a root owned SUID binary `dm_secure_writer`. The binary has security controls in place preventing creation of a file in a non-owned directory, or as the root user. However, these controls can be carefully bypassed to allow for an arbitrary file write as root.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecurely implemented security controls within the `dm_secure_writer` SUID binary, allowing for bypass and arbitrary file write as root.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local Privilege Escalation from a non-privileged Documentum user to root, leading to code execution as root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access as the Documentum Content Server user to the machine with the affected software.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs local access as a non-privileged Documentum user on the machine where the affected software is installed."
