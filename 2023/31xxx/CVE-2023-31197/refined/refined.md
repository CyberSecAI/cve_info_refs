- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in the IntelÂ® Trace Analyzer and Collector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the paths it uses to search for resources, which can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, requiring the attacker to have an existing account on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have local access to the system and be an authenticated user. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the search paths that the software uses. The attack requires user interaction.
