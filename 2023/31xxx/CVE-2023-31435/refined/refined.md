Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improperly implemented authorization scheme within the Evasys application, allowing users to bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Inconsistent Authorization Checks:** The application's authorization logic is flawed, permitting users to access URLs and functions beyond their designated roles. Specifically, the application uses a token for authentication, but fails to properly validate the user's permissions when accessing specific URLs.
*   **Direct Object Reference:**  The application allows direct access to objects (e.g., online templates, user attributes) by manipulating parameters in the URL (e.g., `frmid`, `userid`) without proper authorization checks.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can modify URL parameters to access and modify resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized read access to sensitive information like lists of sub-areas, survey data, user information, performance overviews, and documents, which are normally restricted to users with higher privileges.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify online templates and potentially other user data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with lower privileges (e.g., "Teilbereichsadmin") can access functions and data that should be restricted to higher-level users or administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly craft URLs with a valid token and access functions not exposed in the GUI.
*   **Parameter Tampering:** Attackers can modify parameters like `frmid` and `userid` in URLs to access or modify data that is not normally accessible to them.
*  **HTTP Proxy Interception:** Attackers can intercept valid requests using an HTTP proxy and manipulate parameters to access unintended resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Evasys system.
*   **Knowledge of URL Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the application's URL structure and parameters.
*   **Token Access:** The attacker needs a valid authentication token.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Evasys application.
