Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of the 'client secret' within the response of the API request `https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info` made by the Line mini-app 'Shizutetsu Store'. This secret should be kept confidential and server-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Secret:** The 'client secret' is embedded in the client-side response, making it accessible to anyone with access to the network traffic.
- **Insecure Storage:** The client-side storage or handling of the secret, as it's not meant to be exposed in the client.
- **Broken Authentication:** The client secret is meant to authenticate and authorize the app, by leaking it, the entire system authentication and authorization is broken.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** An attacker can use the leaked 'client secret' to obtain a 'channel access token'.
- **Malicious Broadcasts:** The 'channel access token' can be used to send malicious broadcast messages to all users of the 'Shizutetsu Store' mini-app on Line. This could include phishing links, fraudulent information, or other malicious content.
- **Compromised Communication Channel:** The core of the communication channel is compromised, as the channel access token is meant to secure it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** The attacker needs to intercept the network traffic from the Line app making the `https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info` request.
- **Client-Side Inspection:** The attacker can possibly get the secret by directly inspecting the app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept or monitor the network traffic of the Line app when the user accesses the 'Shizutetsu Store' mini-app.
- The attacker does not need any special permissions or privileges, simply a standard user with the ability to sniff network traffic or possibly inspect the client-side application.
- Knowledge of the API endpoint (`https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info`) is required for the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected version is Line 13.6.1.
- The vulnerability affects all users of the 'Shizutetsu Store' mini-app on Line.
- The provided documentation contains images of the vulnerable response and the tool used to verify the exploit.
