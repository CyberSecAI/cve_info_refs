```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient verification of firmware integrity during the update process. The system blindly executes uploaded files without verifying their authenticity or integrity.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Unrestricted file upload: The application allows users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation.
    - Lack of input sanitization: The uploaded file name is directly used in the `exec` commands, leading to potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    - Insecure file extraction: The application extracts the uploaded archive to a temporary directory without proper verification.
    - Uncontrolled execution: The extracted file `assist` is executed directly without any checks.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a malicious archive containing executable code, which will then be executed on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
- Attack vectors:
    - Uploading a malicious file through the `/index.php/management/upgrade_ecu` endpoint.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to access the vulnerable endpoint.
    - Ability to craft a malicious tar archive containing an executable file.
