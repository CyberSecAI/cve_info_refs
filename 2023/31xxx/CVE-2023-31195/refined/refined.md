Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31195:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ASUS Router RT-AX3000 uses sensitive cookies without the 'Secure' attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing 'Secure' attribute on sensitive cookies (CWE-614). The 'Secure' attribute ensures that cookies are only transmitted over encrypted (HTTPS) connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking. If an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and trick a user into logging into the router via an unencrypted HTTP connection, the attacker can potentially steal the user's session cookie and gain unauthorized access to the router's management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- The user must be tricked into logging into the device through an unencrypted (HTTP) connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user and the router (MITM attack).
- The attacker needs to trick the user into logging in through an unencrypted connection.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects ASUS Router RT-AX3000 firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.4.388.23403.
- The vendor has released firmware updates to address the issue.
- JPCERT/CC has assigned the vulnerability a CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 and a CVSS v2 base score of 2.6, which indicates a low to medium severity.
