An AirVantage online Warranty Checker tool vulnerability could allow an attacker to 
perform bulk enumeration of IMEI and Serial Numbers pairs. The AirVantage Warranty Checker is updated to no longer return the IMEI and Serial 
Number in addition to the warranty status when the Serial Number or IMEI is used to look up 
warranty status.
