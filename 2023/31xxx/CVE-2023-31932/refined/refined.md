Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct inclusion of the `viewid` GET parameter into an SQL query without any sanitization or input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation. By manipulating the `viewid` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive information such as user data, passwords, or financial records.
- **Authentication Bypass:** With a successful SQL injection, the attacker might bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to disrupt the normal operation of the database, leading to a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use SQL injection to extract information from the database tables and schema.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `viewid` parameter in the URL of an HTTP GET request. For example, `http://localhost/rpms/admin/view-enquiry.php?viewid=1%20and%201=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests, specifically GET requests, and how to modify parameters.
- **SQL Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to construct and inject SQL payloads.

**Additional Information:**

The provided document also includes testing methods:

1.  **Manual Testing:** Demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting `1 and 1=1` and `1 and 1=2` into the viewid parameter, showing that different page responses can be achieved by manipulating the SQL query.
2.  **Automated Testing:** Demonstrates using `sqlmap` to identify and exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. The command used is `python sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost/rpms/admin/view-enquiry.php?viewid=1" --cookie="PHPSESSID=4acbjc61q1opnkih7qmkd6g9t7" -D rpmsdb --tables --batch`.

The vulnerable code snippet is also provided:

```php
<?php
$vid=$_GET['viewid'];
$sql="SELECT * from  tblpass where ID=$vid";
$query = $dbh -> prepare($sql);
$query->execute();
$results=$query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
$cnt=1;
if($query->rowCount() > 0)
{
foreach($results as $row)
{               ?>
```
This shows that the `viewid` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization.
