Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31723:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly mentions CVE-2023-31723 and provides a link to its NVD entry.
   - The provided details, including the affected software (yasm), vulnerable function (`expand_mmac_params`), and the crash details (segmentation fault), align with the official description of the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability lies within the `expand_mmac_params` function in `nasm-pp.c` of the yasm assembler.
   - Specifically, the issue occurs when accessing `mac->params[n]` where `mac->params` appears to be an array of macro parameters.
   - The crash suggests an out-of-bounds read or access to an invalid memory location when accessing the `params` array.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This means the code is trying to access a memory location within the `mac->params` array that is outside the valid bounds of allocated memory for the array. This can occur if the code doesn't correctly validate the index `n`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Segmentation Fault (SEGV):** Successful exploitation leads to a segmentation fault, causing the yasm assembler to crash.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash effectively results in a denial-of-service, preventing the assembler from functioning correctly.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Crafted Assembly File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted assembly file.
   - **Input to Assembler:** The malicious input is provided as a command-line argument to the `yasm` assembler.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `yasm` assembler with the malicious input file. This generally means the attacker needs local access to the system or the ability to provide the crafted input file to a process that uses `yasm`.
   - **Ability to provide a crafted input:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specific input file that contains the vulnerable code path which will trigger out of bounds read.
   - **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability does not require special user privileges to exploit.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The provided AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output confirms the memory access violation. It pinpoints the exact line in the `expand_mmac_params` function.
- The GDB result also indicates that `mac->params[n]` access is causing a segmentation fault.

**In summary,** the vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when expanding macro parameters in `yasm`. An attacker can provide a crafted assembly file to trigger a segmentation fault in `yasm`, resulting in a denial-of-service. The attacker needs to be able to execute `yasm` locally with the malicious input.
