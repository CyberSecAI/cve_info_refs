Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the improper neutralization of an SQL parameter in the `ailinear` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `others` and `more` variables, submitted via POST or GET, were not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). The module was vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
* **Impact of exploitation**:
    * Obtaining admin access
    * Removing data from the PrestaShop database
    * Copying sensitive data (including tokens) from the database to the front end, potentially unlocking admin ajax scripts.
    * Rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails.
* **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests using POST or GET parameters.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability, and can perform the attack remotely.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerable code was located in `includes/ajax.php` of the `ailinear` module.
* The vulnerability existed in versions prior to 2.4.3.
* The fix involved sanitizing the `others` variable and ensuring that values in `more` variable are integers
* The advisory also includes general recommendations for PrestaShop security, such as upgrading to the latest version, changing the default database prefix, and activating OWASP rules on a WAF.
