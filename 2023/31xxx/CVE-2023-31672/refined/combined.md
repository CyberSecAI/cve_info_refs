[Cybersecurity Glossary](/glossary/)[About](/about/)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “Length, weight or volume sell” (ailinear) for PrestaShop, an attacker can perform SQL injection up to 2.4.3. Release 2.4.3 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-31672](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31672)
* **Published at**: 2023-06-15
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: ailinear
* **Impacted release**: < 2.4.3 (2.4.3 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: ai-dev
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Up to 2.4.3, a sensitive SQL call in file `includes/ajax.php` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted `others` and `more` variables.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to exposed tokens and unlock admins’ ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Other recommendations

* + To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
