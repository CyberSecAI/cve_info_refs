Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31287:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses password reset tokens that remain valid even after the password has been changed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reusable Password Reset Tokens:** Password reset links, sent via email, include a user-specific token that can be used to change the user's password. This token remains valid for 3 hours, even after the password has been successfully changed using the link.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the user's browser history (or email if the email was not deleted) within the 3-hour window could use the password reset link to change the user's password again, thus gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Browser History Access:** An attacker could gain access to the user's browser history to obtain the password reset link if the user doesn't clear their history.
- **Email Access:** An attacker who gains access to the user's email could also find the password reset link if the user did not delete the reset email.
- **Eavesdropping:** An attacker who is able to eavesdrop on network traffic could potentially intercept the reset link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to gain access to the user's browser history or the user's email containing the reset link.
- The attacker must act within the 3-hour window the reset token remains valid.
