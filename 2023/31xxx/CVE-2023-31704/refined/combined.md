This project is entitled **Online Computer and Laptop Store**. This web application was developed to provide an online platform for a certain computer store or business possible customers for exploring and ordering the products. The project is written in **PHP Language** and **MySQL DB**. It has a pleasant user interface using **Bootstrap Framework** and **AdminLTE Template**. It consists of multiple user-friendly features and functionalities.

## **How do the **Online Computer and Laptop Store work?****

The **Online Computer and Laptop Store** contains 2 modules or is composed of 2 sites which are the **Management** and the [**Client**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15027/simple-client-management-system-php-source-code.html) Site. Public Visitors can also explore the different products that are available in the store.

The project **Management Site** is the side of the system that is only accessible to the store management. The management can manage the list of products, product categories, product sub-categories, inventory, and orders, and generate sales reports. Each management features contains [**CRUD**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorial/php/15842/json-crud-operation-php-tutorial) (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). Here, management can manage the client orders such updating the status of the order and the payment status.

The **Client Site** is the side of the system where they can explore the different products of the store. They can search for their desired product to if it is available in the store. The product list can be filtered by category and subcategory. On the product details page, they can read the full details about the product including the price and availability of the product. They can also add products to the [shopping cart](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15712/advance-shopping-cart-using-php-free-source-code.html) for checking out later or along with other products.

Furthermore, this project is integrated with the **PayPal** sandbox **API** as the cashless or online payment method. The management can also update the site information dynamically such as the site name, icon/logo, and banners.

### [Login and Edit Account Resolved.](/comment/103272#comment-103272)

Hi, I resolved by replacing the lines 383 and 593 in the Master (you can locate it on /classes/Master.php) with this:
`$_POST['password'] = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);`
The issue was that it was saving as a
> MD5

and not as the main
> Password Hash

of PHP, so when wanted to make a look up it doesn't work 'cause it has a different hash.
I hope you can get this and can resolve this as I do.
God bless you All
