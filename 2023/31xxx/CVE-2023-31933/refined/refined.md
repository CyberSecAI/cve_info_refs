Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `editid` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation or sanitization of the `editid` parameter before being used in the SQL query. Specifically, the code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query: `$sql="SELECT * from  tblpass where ID=$eid";` where `$eid` is directly obtained from user input via the GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- The attacker could also modify or delete data in the database.
- The provided content demonstrates that an attacker can use SQL injection to enumerate database tables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `editid` in the URL `http://localhost/rpms/admin/edit-pass-detail.php?editid=1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is in the public-facing portion of the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes test cases demonstrating that the SQL injection is present by using `1 and 1=1` which returns data, and `1 and 1=2` which returns no data.
- The content demonstrates successful exploitation with sqlmap.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$eid=$_GET['editid'];
$sql="SELECT * from  tblpass where ID=$eid";
$query = $dbh -> prepare($sql);
$query->execute();
$results=$query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
```
