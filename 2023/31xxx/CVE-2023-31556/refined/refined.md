Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by excessive recursion in the `PoDoFo::PdfDictionary::findKeyParent` function. This function is called recursively when searching for a key within a PDF dictionary and its parent dictionaries. A specially crafted PDF file can trigger a large number of recursive calls, exceeding the stack's capacity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unbounded recursion in `PoDoFo::PdfDictionary::findKeyParent`.
- Lack of proper checks or limits to prevent deep recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow leading to program crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a malicious PDF file as input to the `podofopdfinfo` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious PDF file.
- Ability to run `podofopdfinfo` tool against the crafted PDF.
- No specific privileges required.

**Technical Details:**

- The stack overflow occurs within the `__asan_memcpy` function which indicates that the stack is being corrupted by excessive memory copying or allocation during the recursive calls.
- The crash occurs due to excessive calls of `PoDoFo::PdfDictionary::findKeyParent`.
- The issue was located in `src/podofo/main/PdfDictionary.cpp:159`.
- The provided sanitizer output shows the call stack leading to the crash, confirming that the `findKeyParent` function is indeed the source of the issue.
- The issue has been closed with commit `8d3e910`.
