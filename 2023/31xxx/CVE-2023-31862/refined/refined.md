Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of server-side sanitization of user-supplied content in article posts within jizhicms v2.4.6. The frontend filters user input but the backend does not, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by directly modifying the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into article content and stored in the database.
*   **Lack of Backend Input Sanitization:** The backend does not properly sanitize or validate user inputs, relying solely on client-side filtering, which can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript code can be executed when a user views the article, specifically during the preview.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, such as administrator passwords, if the administrator uses the browser's autofill feature since the password field was not filtered.
*   **Account Takeover:** By obtaining the administrator's password, the attacker could gain full control over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the HTTP request to include malicious JavaScript within the article content. This bypasses the front-end filtering mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit articles:** The attacker needs to be able to submit content to the system.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint:** The attacker must know the API endpoint used for submitting article content.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests to insert the malicious script.
*   **Administrator Interaction**: The malicious payload is triggered upon administrator preview of the article

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by a user named `1y0ng`.
*   The attacker crafts a specific JavaScript payload to extract and alert the administrator's password by injecting a login form and reading from the password field which was automatically filled by the browser.
*   The jizhicms developer, `Cherry-toto`, initially did not believe the vulnerability existed but later confirmed and fixed it.
* The reported issue mentions that the system's cookies are set to HttpOnly. While this prevents some forms of XSS attacks, the vulnerability described in the report can bypass this protection by obtaining passwords using the browser's auto-fill function.

This information provides a good overview of the security vulnerability.
