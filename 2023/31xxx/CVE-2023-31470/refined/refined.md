Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-31470.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `_dns_encode_domain` function within the `dns.c` file. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when writing to the `packet_buff` variable. The overflow can be triggered by crafting a specific DNS request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `_dns_encode_domain` function writes beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- Insufficient bounds checking: The code lacks proper validation of the length of data being written to the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can cause the SmartDNS server to crash.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted DNS request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious DNS request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the SmartDNS server to send crafted DNS packets.
- No specific authentication is needed, as the vulnerability occurs during the processing of a received DNS packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASAN output clearly shows a stack buffer overflow at `dns.c:298:11` in the `_dns_encode_domain` function.
- The GDB backtrace demonstrates the crash occurring during the processing of a DNS packet.
- The fix provided by the user `htejeda` involves checking if there is enough space left in the buffer before writing to it.
- The maintainer implemented the suggested fix by adding checks for remaining buffer length using the `_dns_left_len` function in multiple places (such as in the `_dns_encode_domain` function, and in the `dns_add_HTTPS_start` function) to prevent writing beyond buffer limits. The commit also modifies functions such as `dns_add_rr_nested_memcpy`, `dns_HTTPS_add_alpn`, `dns_HTTPS_add_ech`, `dns_HTTPS_add_ipv4hint`, `dns_HTTPS_add_ipv6hint` to check for remaining buffer length. There were also other changes including the correction of function parameters, addition of safety checks for null pointers, and some formatting.
