The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DedeCMS up to version 5.7.108.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `sys_info.php` file, specifically the parameters `edit___cfg_powerby` and `edit___cfg_beian`. These parameters, which are intended to store copyright and licensing information, do not properly encode or sanitize HTML special characters when being saved into the system configuration, and subsequently rendered in admin panels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code is stored within the system configuration, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when viewing certain admin panels.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various impacts including but not limited to:
  - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
  - Defacement of the admin panel
  - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
- Complete system takeover is possible if the administrator session is hijacked.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attacker sends a POST request to `sys_info.php` with malicious payloads in the `edit___cfg_powerby` and `edit___cfg_beian` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or user with access to modify the website configuration in order to exploit this vulnerability.
