  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-buffer-overflow in the `expand_mmacro` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The heap buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
   "Attack vectors": "Crafted NASM assembly file that triggers the vulnerable `expand_mmacro` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious assembly file to be processed by NASM."
