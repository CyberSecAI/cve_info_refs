The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31627. The information from the github issue #1140 indicates a crash vulnerability in Virtuoso 7.2.9.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered by using `CONTAINS(*, ...)` in a SQL query, where the first argument of the `CONTAINS()` function is a wildcard `*`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code handling the `CONTAINS` function with a wildcard as the first argument leads to a crash. Specifically, the crash occurs within the `strhash` function, indicating a likely issue related to how string hashing is handled within the context of the wildcard usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Virtuoso server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted SQL query using the `CONTAINS` function with the wildcard `*` as the first argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against the Virtuoso server.

The provided content gives detailed information, including the PoC SQL query and the backtrace, which is not provided in the CVE description. It also includes how to reproduce the crash using a docker container.
