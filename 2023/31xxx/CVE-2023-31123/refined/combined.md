# Improper password verification on POST `/api/v1/account/login`

Critical

[5HT2](/5HT2)
published
GHSA-356r-rwp8-h6m6
Apr 30, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/effectindex/tripreporter
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b

## Patched versions

bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, eg <https://subjective.report>.

The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to login as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Patched in [bd80ba8](https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/commit/bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b).

**No action necessary for users on <https://subjective.report>**, anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer, as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Apply this patch:

```
diff --git a/api/account.go b/api/account.go
index be89603..b9c08a0 100644
--- a/api/account.go
+++ b/api/account.go
@@ -84,7 +84,7 @@ func AccountPostLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
 		return
 	}

-	account, err = a1.ValidatePassword(account.Password, "Password")
+	account, err = a1.VerifyPassword(account.Password)
 	if err != nil {
 		ctx.HandleStatus(w, r, "Invalid username or password!", http.StatusForbidden)
 		return

```
### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

Not at the moment.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
