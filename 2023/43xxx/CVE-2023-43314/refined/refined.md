The provided content details a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in ZYXEL PMG2005-T20B devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cgi-bin/login.asp` component of the ZYXEL PMG2005-T20B device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Buffer overflow in the handling of the `uid` parameter within the `cgi-bin/login.asp` component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable component, leading to browser crashes and potentially disrupting the functionality of the device. The backend parsing of the crafted request causes any web application of the product ZYXEL-PMG2005-T20B to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `cgi-bin/index.asp` endpoint.
* The malicious request includes a long string of "admin" values in the uid parameter within the cookie.
* A valid SESSIONID is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker must have a valid session ID.
