{
  "CVE-2023-43804": {
    "root_cause": "The `Cookie` request header is not stripped during cross-origin redirects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The urllib3 library does not treat the `Cookie` HTTP header as sensitive during redirects.",
      "The library does not provide explicit helpers for managing cookies, relying on the user to handle this."
    ],
    "impact": "A user specifying a `Cookie` header can unknowingly leak this information via HTTP redirects to a different origin. This could lead to unauthorized access or information disclosure.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A user makes an HTTP request including a `Cookie` header.",
        "The initial server redirects to a different origin.",
        "The `Cookie` header is sent to the redirected origin, potentially exposing sensitive information."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious origin that the vulnerable application redirects to. The attacker does not need to control the initial server sending the redirect."
