The provided content relates to CVE-2023-43640.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `find_for_autocomplete` method across multiple models (`CollectionObjectObservation`, `Content`, `Language`, and `Topic`) within the TaxonWorks application. The method constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input (`params[:term]`) without proper sanitization, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application directly incorporates user-controlled input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the TaxonWorks database, including user credentials stored in the users table.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker would need to make a request to an endpoint that utilizes the vulnerable `find_for_autocomplete` method and supply malicious SQL code through the `term` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability.
