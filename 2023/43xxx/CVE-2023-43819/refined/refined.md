- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when parsing the `InitialMacroLen` field of a DPS file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious DPS file and lure a user into opening it.
