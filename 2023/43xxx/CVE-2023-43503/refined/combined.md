SUMMARY

COMOS is affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or
cause denial of service condition, data infiltration or perform access control violations.

Siemens has released an update for COMOS and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens
recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

Update to V10.4.4 or later version
For CVE-2023-43503, update to V10.4.4 or later
version and update the COMOS database to ver-
sion 25. (See “Data maintenance: Modifying the
version” in the user manual. Warning: After the
update, the database cannot be used by older
COMOS versions)

Currently no fix is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Ensure all files imported into COMOS originate from a trusted source and transmitted are over

secure channels

• CVE-2023-43505, CVE-2023-46601: Use an application server like Citrix which builds an additional
layer of access control around COMOS. The file share with the documents folder and the database
should be only accessible by the application server. You can find further recommendations in the
COMOS manual “Securityrelevant configuration” in COMOS documentation (https://support.industry.
siemens.com/cs/document/109823629/)

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

COMOS is a unified data platform for collaborative plant design, operation and management that supports
collecting, processing, saving, and distributing of information throughout the entire plant lifecycle.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
