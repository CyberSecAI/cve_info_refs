- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document doesn't detail the impact, but XSS vulnerabilities typically allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, suggesting the attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The specific capabilities or position of an attacker aren't detailed, but typically, an attacker would need to find an injection point in the web application to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

The document provides a high-level overview of the XSS vulnerability and its remediation.
