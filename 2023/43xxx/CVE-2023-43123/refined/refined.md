Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of `File.createTempFile` in Apache Storm on Unix-like systems. This method, by default, creates temporary files with permissions `-rw-r--r--`, making them readable by other local users. This occurs because temporary files are created in a shared directory and permissions are not explicitly set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:**  The `File.createTempFile` method creates temporary files with overly permissive default permissions (world-readable).
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information written to these temporary files can be accessed by other local users.
- **Shared Temporary Directory:** The reliance on the shared system temporary directory on Unix-like systems without setting appropriate file permissions is a core weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  Other users on the same system can potentially read sensitive information written to the temporary files created by the vulnerable code.
- However, the impact is limited because the vulnerable code is only executed under specific circumstances. In this case, when the `ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring` property is set to false (defaults to true). And, the temporary files are deleted soon after their creation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the same system as the vulnerable Apache Storm instance.
- **File System Access:** The attacker exploits the default file permissions of temporary files created by `File.createTempFile`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the same Unix-like system where Apache Storm is running with the affected configuration (`ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring` set to false).
- They need to be able to access and read files in the system's temporary directory.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `TopologySpoutLag.java` class.
- The vulnerability was introduced by a change related to `STORM-3123`.
- The fix involves using `Files.createTempFile` to create temporary files with secure permissions (setting specific permissions)
- The issue is specific to Unix-like systems and does not affect modern macOS.
