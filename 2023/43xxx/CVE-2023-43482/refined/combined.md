##### February 6, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-43482

##### SUMMARY

A command execution vulnerability exists in the guest resource functionality of Tp-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router 1.3.0 build 20230322 Rel.70591. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Tp-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router 1.3.0 build 20230322 Rel.70591

##### PRODUCT URLS

ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router - <https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/vpn-router/er7206/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router is a high-performance networking solution that supports gigabit connectivity, highly secure VPN and integration with Omada SDN for centralized cloud management and zero-touch provisioning.

The ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router runs various services to manage the router or devices connected to the router. One such service is `uhttpd` which runs on port 80/443. It gives users a web interface to configure and manage the router. By default, the service runs as a root user. An attacker can gain root access to the device by exploiting this service.

A command injection vulnerability exists in the `uhttpd` service when a guest resource is added to the device. In the web interface, the guest resource page can be accessed by navigating to `Authentication` -> `Authentication Settings` -> `Guest Resources`. It contains features to add, edit, and delete guest resources. When a guest resource is added, it triggers the following the HTTP Post request:

```
POST /cgi-bin/luci/;stok=b53d9dc12fe8aa66f4fdc273e6eaa534/admin/freeStrategy?form=strategy_list HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: python-requests/2.31.0

```

The name of the guest resource is vulnerable to the command injection vulnerbaility. It is used as an argument to a shell command without any sanitization. An attacker, by including shell metacharacters in the `name` parameter, can manipulate the executed command and introduce unauthorized commands, which leads to the command injection vulnerability.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor released a new firmware available at:
