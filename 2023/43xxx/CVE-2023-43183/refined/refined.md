{
  "CVE-2023-43183": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect access control.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control allows low-level users (e.g., read-only users) to perform privileged actions."
    ],
    "Impact": "Low-level users can change the password of an admin account, leading to account compromise and privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/change_password_process` endpoint and modifying the `user` parameter with the username of the target account.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Reprise License Manager server and a low-level user account (e.g., read-only)."
  }
