Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-43505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper access controls in SMB shares within the affected application (COMOS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The application does not adequately restrict access to files via SMB shares, allowing users to potentially access files they should not have permissions for.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files that they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Violation:** Unauthorized access can lead to a breach of confidentiality (reading sensitive data) and potentially a violation of integrity (modification of files).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through the network, exploiting the improperly secured SMB shares.
*   **SMB Shares:** The vulnerability is specifically related to how the application handles access controls to shared files via SMB protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the system running the vulnerable COMOS application.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges on the network or system. They only need to be able to connect to the SMB share to exploit the issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Fix Planned:** The advisory states that there is currently no fix planned for this vulnerability.
*   **Workaround:** The suggested workaround involves using an application server like Citrix to create an additional layer of access control around COMOS and restrict direct access to the file share and database.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a high CVSS base score of 9.6, indicating a critical severity.
