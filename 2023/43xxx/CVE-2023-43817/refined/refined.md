- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs in Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft when parsing the `wMailContentLen` field of a DPS file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious DPS file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable software. The attacker is remote and does not require authentication.
