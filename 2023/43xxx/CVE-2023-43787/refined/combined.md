### Avoid CVE-2023-43786: stack exhaustion in XPutImage()

```

This doesn't fix the CVE - that has to happen in libX11, this
just tries to avoid triggering it from libXpm, and saves time
in not pretending we can successfully create an X11 pixmap with
dimensions larger than the unsigned 16-bit integers used in the
X11 protocol for the dimensions.

### CVE-2023-43787: Integer overflow in XCreateImage() leading to a heap overflow

```

When the format is `Pixmap` it calculates the size of the image data as:
    ROUNDUP((bits_per_pixel * width), image->bitmap_pad);
There is no validation on the `width` of the image, and so this
calculation exceeds the capacity of a 4-byte integer, causing an overflow.

X.Org Security Advisory:  October 3, 2023

Issues in libX11 prior to 1.8.7 & libXpm prior to 3.5.17
========================================================

Multiple issues have been found in the libX11 & libXpm libraries published
by X.Org for which we are releasing security fixes in libX11 1.8.7 &
libXpm 3.5.17.

The first issue (CVE-2023-43785) can be triggered by connecting to an
X server that sends specially crafted replies to X11 protocol requests.

The other 4 issues can be triggered by opening specially crafted XPM format
image files via libXpm.  Two of the four issues have root causes in the
libX11 library and are fixed there, but patches have also been applied
to libXpm to avoid passing the invalid data to libX11 in the first place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) CVE-2023-43785 libX11: out-of-bounds memory access in _XkbReadKeySyms()

Introduced in: X11R6.1 [released March 1996]
Fixed in: libX11 1.8.7
Found by: Gregory James DUCK
Fixed by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering

When libX11 is processing the reply from the X server to the XkbGetMap
request, if it detected the number of symbols in the new map was less
than the size of the buffer it had allocated, it always added room for
128 more symbols, instead of the actual size needed. While the
_XkbReadBufferCopyKeySyms() helper function returned an error if asked
to copy more keysyms into the buffer than there was space allocated for,
the caller never checked for an error and assumed the full set of keysyms
was copied into the buffer and could then try to read out of bounds when
accessing the buffer.  libX11 1.8.7 has been patched to both fix the size
allocated and check for error returns from _XkbReadBufferCopyKeySyms().

2) CVE-2023-43786 libX11: stack exhaustion from infinite recursion
   in PutSubImage()

Introduced in: X11R2 [released Feb. 1988]
Fixed in: libX11 1.8.7
Found by: Yair Mizrahi of the JFrog Vulnerability Research team
Fixed by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering

When splitting a single line of pixels into chunks that fit in a single
request (not using the BIG-REQUESTS extension) to send to the X server,
the code did not take into account the number of bits per pixel, so would
just loop forever finding it needed to send more pixels than fit in the
given request size and not breaking them down into a small enough chunk to
fit.  An XPM file was provided that triggered this bug when loaded via
libXpm's XpmReadFileToPixmap() function, which in turn calls XPutImage()
and hit this bug.

Further hardening to prevent similar bugs was done in libX11 by making
XPutImage() clip images to the maximum X protocol pixmap size (limited
by the use of unsigned 16-bit integers for height & width) when writing
to X pixmaps, and by making XCreatePixmap() generate X errors if a
height or width was specified that did not fit into an unsigned 16-bit
integer.  In libXpm, hardening was done to return error codes for any
call that would have passed out-of-bounds width or height values to
XCreatePixmap().

3) CVE-2023-43787 libX11: integer overflow in XCreateImage() leading to
   a heap overflow

Introduced in: X11R2 [released Feb. 1988]
Fixed in: libX11 1.8.7
Found by: Yair Mizrahi of the JFrog Vulnerability Research team
Fixed by: Yair Mizrahi of the JFrog Vulnerability Research team

When creating an image, there was no validation that the multiplication
of the caller-provided width by the visual's bits_per_pixel did not
overflow and thus result in the allocation of a buffer too small to hold
the data that would be copied into it.  An XPM file was provided that
triggered this bug when loaded via libXpm's XpmReadFileToPixmap() function,
which in turn calls XCreateImage() and hit this bug.

Further hardening to prevent similar bugs was done in libXpm to return
error codes for any call to XCreateImage() that would have resulted in
this calculation overflowing.

Fix:
<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/7916869d16bdd115ac5be30a67c3749907aea6a0>

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxpm/-/commit/91f887b41bf75648df725a4ed3be036da02e911e>

4) CVE-2023-43788 libXpm: out of bounds read in XpmCreateXpmImageFromBuffer()

Introduced in: unknown - prior to xpm-3.4k [released 1998]
Fixed in: libXpm 3.5.17
Found by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering
Fixed by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering

When the test case for CVE-2022-46285 (fixed in libXpm 3.5.15) was run
with the Address Sanitizer enabled, it found an out-of-bounds read in
ParseComment() when reading from a memory buffer instead of a file, as
it continued to look for the closing comment marker past the end of the
buffer.

Fix:
<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxpm/-/commit/2fa554b01ef6079a9b35df9332bdc4f139ed67e0>

5) CVE-2023-43789 libXpm: out of bounds read on XPM with corrupted colormap

Introduced in: unknown - prior to xpm-3.4k [released 1998]
Fixed in: libXpm 3.5.17
Found by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering
Fixed by: Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris Engineering

Fuzzing with clang's -fsanitize/libfuzzer generated an XPM file with a
corrupted colormap section which caused libXpm to read out of bounds.

Fix:

X.Org thanks all of those who reported and fixed these issues, and those
who helped with the review and release of this advisory and these fixes.

The X.Org security team would like to take this opportunity to remind X client
authors that current best practices suggest separating code that requires
privileges from the GUI, to reduce the risk of issues like CVE-2023-43785.

*“Most large companies have multiple sites and it is critical for those companies to manage authentication and permission efficiently across locations. JFrog Enterprise+ will provide us with an ideal setup that will allow us to meet our rigorous requirements from the get go. It's advanced capabilities, like Access Federation, will reduce our overhead by keeping the users, permissions, and and groups in-sync between sites.”*
Siva Mandadi
DevOps - Autonomous Driving, Mercedes

*“JFrog Enterprise+ increases developer productivity and eliminates frustration. JFrog Distribution is basically a CDN On-Prem that enables us to distribute software to remote locations in a reliable way. Whereas, JFrog Access Federation gives us the ability to share credentials, access and group memebers across different locations with ease.”*
Artem Semenov
Senior Manager for DevOps and Tooling,
 Align Technology

*"Instead of a 15-month cycle, today we can release virtually on request.”*
Martin Eggenberger
Chief Architect,
Monster

*“As a long-time DevOps engineer, I know how difficult it can be to keep track of the myriad of package types – legacy and new – that corporations have in their inventory. JFrog has always done a phenomenal job at keeping our team supported, efficient and operational – because if JFrog goes out, we might as well go home. Thankfully, with AWS infrastructure at our backs as well, we know we can develop and deliver with confidence anywhere our business demands today, and in the future.”*
Joel Vasallo
Head of Cloud DevOps,
Redbox

*“The capabilities of Artifactory are what allow us to do what we can do today…With Xray, [security] is a no-brainer – it’s built in, just turn it on, wow! I’ll take that all day long.”*
Larry Grill,
DevSecOps Sr. Manager,
Hitachi Vantara

*“When we had that issue with log4j, it was announced on Friday afternoon and [using JFrog] by Monday at noon we had all cities rolled out with the patch.”*
Hanno Walischewski
Chief System Architect,
Yunex Traffic

*“Among the lessons we learned from this compromise is, in general, you should arrange your system so you never build directly from the internet without any intervening scanning tool in place to validate the dependencies you bring into your builds. To this end, we use an instance of JFrog® Artifactory®, not the cloud service, to host our dependencies, which is the only valid source for any software artifacts bound for staging, production, or on-premises releases.”*

*"Since moving to Artifactory, our team has been able to cut down our maintenance burden significantly…we’re able to move on and be a more in depth DevOps organization."*
Stefan Krause
Software Engineer,
Workiva

*“Over 300,000 users around the world rely on PRTG to monitor vital parts of their different-sized networks. Therefore, it is our obligation to develop and enhance not only our software itself but also the security and release processes around it. JFrog helps us do this in the most efficient manner.”*
Konstantin Wolff
Infrastructure Engineer,
Paessler AG

*“JFrog Connect, for me, is really a scaling tool so I can deploy edge IoT integrations much quicker and manage them at a larger scale. There’s less manual, one-off intervention when connecting to different customer sites with different VPNs and firewall requirements.”*
Ben Fussell
Systems Integration Engineer,
Ndustrial

*"We wanted to figure out what can we really use instead of having five, six different applications. Maintaining them. Is there anything we can use as a single solution? And Artifactory came to the rescue. It really turned out to be a one-stop shop for us. It really provided everything that we need."*

## RCE vulnerability – CVE-2023-43787

CVE-2023-43787 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when parsing a malformed XPM image, which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.

Fix commit:

The vulnerability was fixed in libX11 version 1.8.7, in commit [7916869d](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/7916869d16bdd115ac5be30a67c3749907aea6a0).

### Technical analysis

The root cause of CVE-2023-43787 lies in `XCreateImage`, a libX11 function that is used to create an `XImage` object, representing an off-screen image that can be manipulated and displayed on the screen. With `XCreateImage`, developers can efficiently manage off-screen images in X11 applications, specifying parameters like width, height, depth, and format to customize image attributes.

```
package org.example;

import java.io.IOException;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.LoaderOptions;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.*;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        LoaderOptions options = new LoaderOptions();
        Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new Constructor(options));
        String strYaml = Files.readString(args[0]);
        String parsed = yaml.load(strYaml);
    }
}
```
```
XImage *XCreateImage (
    register Display *dpy,
    register Visual *visual,
    unsigned int depth,
    int format,
    int offset,
    char *data,
    unsigned int width,
    unsigned int height,
    int xpad,
    int image_bytes_per_line)
        /*How many bytes between a pixel on one line and the pixel with the same X coordinate on the next line? 0 means 	  XCreateImage can calculate it.*/
{
    register XImage *image;
    int bits_per_pixel = 1;
    int min_bytes_per_line;

    .......
    if (format == ZPixmap)
    {
       bits_per_pixel = _XGetBitsPerPixel(dpy, (int) depth); [1]
    }

    image->xoffset = offset;
    image->bitmap_pad = xpad;
    image->depth = depth;
    image->data = data;
    /*
     * compute per line accelerator.
     */
    {
    if (format == ZPixmap)
        min_bytes_per_line =                              [2]
           ROUNDUP((bits_per_pixel * width), image->bitmap_pad);
    else
        min_bytes_per_line =
            ROUNDUP((width + offset), image->bitmap_pad);
    }
     if (image_bytes_per_line == 0) {
        image->bytes_per_line = min_bytes_per_line;
    } else if (image_bytes_per_line < min_bytes_per_line) { Xfree(image); return NULL; } else { image->bytes_per_line = image_bytes_per_line;     [3]
    }
    .......
```

When the format is `ZPixmap` it calculates `bits_per_pixel` [1], and then uses the result to calculate the `min_bytes_per_line` [2].

It is then set to the `bytes_per_line` attribute of the XImage [3].

There is no validation on the `width` of the image, and so the calculation [2] exceeds the capacity of `min_bytes_per_line` (a 4-byte integer), causing an overflow.

`XCreateImage` is called from libXpm’s `CreateXImage` function, defined in `create.c`:

```
/*
 * Create an XImage with its data
 */
static int
CreateXImage(
    Display	 *display,
    Visual	 *visual,
    unsigned int  depth,
    int		  format,
    unsigned int  width,
    unsigned int  height,
    XImage	**image_return)
{
    ...

    /* then create the XImage with data = NULL and bytes_per_line = 0 */
    *image_return = XCreateImage(display, visual, depth, format, 0, 0,
                     width, height, bitmap_pad, 0);                       [1]
    if (!*image_return)
    return (XpmNoMemory);

#if !defined(FOR_MSW) && !defined(AMIGA)
    if (height != 0 && (*image_return)->bytes_per_line >= INT_MAX / height) {
        XDestroyImage(*image_return);
        *image_return = NULL;
        return XpmNoMemory;
    }
    /* now that bytes_per_line must have been set properly alloc data */
    if((*image_return)->bytes_per_line == 0 ||  height == 0) {
        XDestroyImage(*image_return);
        *image_return = NULL;
        return XpmNoMemory;
    }
    (*image_return)->data =
        (char *) XpmMalloc((*image_return)->bytes_per_line * height);     [2]

    ...
}
```

On [1] there’s the call to the vulnerable `XCreateImage` function that calculates the size needed to be allocated.

On [2] there’s an allocation that uses the overflown `bytes_per_line` property of the XImage, which will then proceed to allocate a smaller buffer than needed.

`CreateXImage` is called from the `xpmParseDataAndCreate` function [1], triggered when libXPM is asked to parse an XPM file:

```
/*
 * This function parses an Xpm file or data and directly create an XImage
 */
int
xpmParseDataAndCreate(
    Display		 *display,
    xpmData		 *data,
    XImage		**image_return,
    XImage		**shapeimage_return,
    XpmImage		 *image,
    XpmInfo		 *info,
    XpmAttributes	 *attributes)
{

   .....

    /*
     * parse the header
     */
    ErrorStatus = xpmParseHeader(data);
    if (ErrorStatus != XpmSuccess)
        return (ErrorStatus);

    /*
     * read values
     */
    ErrorStatus = xpmParseValues(data, &width, &height, &ncolors, &cpp,
                 &x_hotspot, &y_hotspot, &hotspot,
                 &extensions);
    if (ErrorStatus != XpmSuccess)
        return (ErrorStatus);

   .........

    /* now create the ximage */
    if (image_return) {
        ErrorStatus = CreateXImage(display, visual, depth,
                       (depth == 1 ? bitmap_format : ZPixmap),
                       width, height, &ximage);                       [1]
    if (ErrorStatus != XpmSuccess)
        RETURN(ErrorStatus);
        .........
```
## Exploiting CVE-2023-43787 to achieve code execution

Let’s discuss all the basic exploitation pieces before moving on to code execution.

### Piece 1 – Controlling the allocation size

The size of the allocation that is overflown, is decided from the width of the Xpm image.

As we discussed in the previous blog post, the width can be easily manipulated by modifying this information in the Xpm header.

So, we have control over the allocation size (heap bin size).

We now want to find out how to control the overflown data.

### Piece 2 – Controlling the overflowed buffer data

The overflown data is `ximage->data`, which is the pointer to the image data.

### Piece 3 – Controlling the overflow size

Controlling the size of the overflow itself (anything that comes after the allocated buffer).

This is easily achieved as Xpm reads the image pixels from the file as long as there are pixels to read.

The `xpmParseDataAndCreate` function calls the `ParseAndPutPixels` function with the ximage object [1]:

```
.....
    /*
     * read pixels and put them in the XImage
     */
    ErrorStatus = ParseAndPutPixels(
#ifdef FOR_MSW
                    display,
#endif
                    data, width, height, ncolors, cpp,
                    colorTable, &hashtable,
                    ximage, image_pixels,                      [1]
                    shapeimage, mask_pixels);
.....
```

The ParseAndPutPixels function loops over the image pixels and fills the ximage->data:

```
.....
        for (x = 0; x < width; x++) {                                  [1]
            int c = xpmGetC(data);                                      [2]
.....

```

On [1], we can see the loop reads data according to `width`, which is very big (as we needed to overflow the size). On [2], a call to the `xpmGetC` macro is made:

```
#define xpmGetC(mdata) \
    ((!mdata->type || mdata->type == XPMBUFFER) ? \
    (*mdata->cptr++) : (getc(mdata->stream.file)))
```
## Multiple Avenues of Exploitation

After going over the basic exploitation pieces, let’s see which primitives can be triggered by overwriting different heap chunks. Specifically, we will examine the case of exploitation when the vulnerability is triggered through the `sxpm` CLI utility (for example, using the simple command-line `sxpm attacker_image.xpm)`. These exploitation avenues can be extrapolated to other vulnerable cases as well (ex. exploiting code that uses the library’s vulnerable functions) –

* [Option #1 – Function pointer overwrite – Code Execution #1](#option-1)
* [Option #2 – Limited Write-What-Where](#option-2)
* [Option #3 – Code Execution #2](#option-3)
* [Option #4 – Another Write-What-Where (dead end in the case of sxpm)](#option-4)

### Option #1 – Function pointer overwrite – Code Execution #1

Due to time constraints, we opted to switch from a 64-bit binary to 32-bit for this exploitation (which would have required more research into the pixel data). Exploitation with Option #1 will focus on Debian 12 32-bit, but the ideas apply similarly to 64-bit.

If we set our overflown bin to 428 bytes (`0x1b0` bin), something interesting happens.

**We manage to overwrite the `dpy` (Display) pointer**, which is later used when freeing the XPM colors.

The `Display` structure size is 2,412 bytes – allocated on the `0x970` large bin.

Specifically, we overwrite the `lock_fns` pointer in this structure:

```
struct _XLockPtrs *lock_fns; /* pointers to threads functions */
```

The libX11 code dereferences this pointer and jumps to the address inside it –

```
int
XFreeColors(
    register Display *dpy,
    Colormap cmap,
    unsigned long *pixels, /* LISTofCARD32 */
    int npixels,
    unsigned long planes) /* CARD32 */
{
    register xFreeColorsReq *req;
    register long nbytes;

    LockDisplay(dpy);                                                          [1]
    GetReq(FreeColors, req);
    req->cmap = cmap;
    req->planeMask = planes;

    /* on the VAX, each pixel is a 32-bit (unsigned) integer */
    req->length += npixels;

    nbytes = npixels << 2;		/* watch out for macros... */
    Data32 (dpy, (long *) pixels, nbytes);
    UnlockDisplay(dpy);
    SyncHandle();
    return 1;
}

```

`LockDisplay` on [1] is a macro:

```
/* used everywhere, so must be fast if not using threads */
#define LockDisplay(d)	     if ((d)->lock_fns) (*(d)->lock_fns->lock_display)(d)
```

As can be seen from the macro, when we overwrite the `dpy` pointer, it will be dereferenced twice and run the resulting pointer, leading to code execution.

After checking the offset of `dpy->lock_fns` in our payload, and setting its pointer to a predictable address in the 32-bit memory space of `sxpm` (e.g. `0x409774`), we have total control over EIP.

![Control over EIP in Debian 12 32-bit](data:image/svg+xml...)![Control over EIP in Debian 12 32-bit](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24163529/1_Control-over-EIP-in-Debian-12-32-bit.png)*Control over EIP in Debian 12 32-bit*

### Option #2 – Limited Write-What-Where

Another possible primitive is to overwrite a pointer to the File Descriptor (in an `xpmData` structure). This happens when we allocate 136 bytes (on the `0x90` fastbin).

Inside the loop that reads each character from the XMP file, it uses it and reads a character.

The `xpmData` structure:

![xpmData structure](data:image/svg+xml...)![xpmData structure](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24163701/2_xpmData-structure.png)

This is a limited relative write-what-where.

We can write 4 bytes (3 controlled bytes + 1 byte fixed ’00’), into a relative address like 0x5555{00414243}.

This can be seen here in [1] and [2]:

### Option #3 – Code Execution Alternative

When allocating a chunk of 136 bytes (which gets allocated on the 0x90 heap fastbin), we can overwrite an `_XLockInfo` object:

![Code Execution Alternative](data:image/svg+xml...)![Code Execution Alternative](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24164059/4_Code-Execution-Alternative.png)

The `_XLockInfo` object: `dpy->lock` structure is 192 bytes long, so it gets allocated on the `0xd0` bin.

![XLockInfo](data:image/svg+xml...)![XLockInfo](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24164325/5_XLockInfo.png)

As can be seen from the backtrace, we overwrote the `mutex` that gets used in the `__pthread_mutex_lock` function, which then gets accessed at the start of the function (using the `rdi` register):

```
int
__pthread_mutex_lock (pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
{
  unsigned int type = PTHREAD_MUTEX_TYPE_ELISION (mutex);
  .....
}

#define PTHREAD_MUTEX_TYPE_ELISION(m) \
  ((m)->__data.__kind & (127|PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP))
```

This is called when freeing the colors structure in `xpmParseDataAndCreate`, which calls the `XFreeColors` function.

After the Mutex is accessed, the data is then used in the `_XDisplayLockWait` function:

```
static void _XDisplayLockWait(
    Display *dpy)
{
    xthread_t self;

    while (dpy->lock->locking_level > 0) {
        self = xthread_self();
        if (xthread_equal(dpy->lock->locking_thread, self))
            break;
        ConditionWait(dpy, dpy->lock->cv);
    }
}
```

The `ConditionWait` is a macro:

```
#define ConditionWait(d,c) if ((d)->lock) \
    (*(d)->lock->condition_wait)(c, (d)->lock->mutex)
```

It dereferences the lock object and then **executes it as a function**.

This can be used as another code execution primitive.

![Code Execution using the Mutex Object](data:image/svg+xml...)![Code Execution using the Mutex Object](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24164716/6_Code-Execution-using-the-Mutex-Object.png)*Code Execution using the Mutex Object*

### Option #4 – Another Write-What-Where (dead end in the case of sxpm)

Another primitive will overwrite the `XImage` structure (which is 136 bytes long – `0x90` bin).

This is when allocating a chunk of 16 bytes (on the `0x20` fastbin).

![absolute write-what-where primitive](data:image/svg+xml...)![absolute write-what-where primitive](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24164903/7_absolute-write-what-where-primitive.png)

Our image data (`ximage->data`) is allocated just before the `XImage` contents, and so we overwrite the `ximage->data` pointer with our data to create this primitive.

This can be an absolute write-what-where primitive.

Again, switching from a 64-bit binary to 32-bit. The rest of the exploitation will focus on Debian 12 32-bit.

The `XImage` structure on 32-bit is 88 bytes long. Let’s try changing the size of our overflowing buffer to 88: Contrary to the 64-bit primitive, on 32-bit our overflowing buffer is allocated after the target `XImage` object.

The `ximage->data` allocation will be adjacent to the `XImage` structure, but in the reverse order (a bit after the `XImage` address).

Therefore – our overflown buffer will not be behind our target XImage structure, and our exploitation won’t work.

Using debug prints:

![Using debug prints](data:image/svg+xml...)![Using debug prints](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24165102/8_Using-debug-prints.png)

Now, let’s groom the heap using an allocation primitive.

There are 4 pixel allocations using the following calculation:

```
sizeof(Pixel) * ncolors
```

On 32-bit, `sizeof(Pixel)` equals 4.

Let’s change the file to have only 22 colors, to achieve our needed 88 bytes (22\*4).

Changing to 22 colors will still not help us overwrite the XImage object.

Using debug prints:

![Using debug prints](data:image/svg+xml...)![Using debug prints](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24165219/9_Using-debug-prints.png)

In the case of `sxpm`, this led us to a dead-end (It would be better to create a new exploitation primitive) however this chain of primitives might be relevant in different exploitation scenarios.

## In which cases can CVE-2023-43787 be triggered?

Any application or library that uses libXPM to parse externally-supplied XPM images, can trigger CVE-2023-43787 with the use of the following vulnerable libXPM exported functions:

```
XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage
XpmCreateImageFromBuffer
XpmCreateImageFromData
XpmCreatePixmapFromXpmImage
XpmCreatePixmapFromBuffer
XpmCreatePixmapFromData
XpmReadFileToImage
XpmReadFileToPixmap
```

For example, `sxpm` is a CLI utility that is used to display XPM images on the screen. The vulnerability can be triggered via `sxpm` with a simple command line –

```
sxpm attacker_image.xpm
```

This utility calls the vulnerable `xpmCreatePixmapFromImage` libXpm function, which then calls the vulnerable libX11 functions `XPutImage` then `PutSubImage`.

## Is the JFrog Platform Vulnerable to CVE-2023-43786 or CVE-2023-43787?

After conducting an internal analysis, we can confirm that the [JFrog Platform](https://jfrog.com/platform/) is not vulnerable to CVE-2023-43786 or CVE-2023-43787.

## Contextual Analysis With JFrog Advanced Security

The [Contextual Analysis](https://jfrog.com/xray/contextual-vulnerabilities/) feature, included in the [JFrog Advanced Security](https://jfrog.com/xray/#xray-advanced) set of capabilities for JFrog Xray, enables users to automatically detect whether these vulnerabilities are applicable in the user’s code base. This process involves running automated contextual scanners on the container image to determine reachable paths and the configuration settings for the analyzed vulnerabilities. Xray automatically validates CVEs that have exploitation prerequisites and provides a contextual analysis report that determines which vulnerabilities are applicable or not. This saves developers a lot of wasted time and effort.

* Save developer time by only remediating vulnerabilities that are applicable
* Analyze the finished code (binary) the same way an attacker would
* Know which CVEs are exploitable and their potential impact
* Test a vulnerability in the context of the complete artifact, build or Release Bundle​
* Enable action and remediation in the context of the artifact, build or Release Bundle

## What is libX11?

Xorg X11, often referred to as X Window System, is an open-source graphical server protocol that enables the creation and management of graphical user interfaces in Unix-like operating systems. It provides a framework for running graphical applications, managing windows, and handling user input in a networked environment.

The libx11 package offers the essential shared libraries that client applications require to render and present data on your desktop.

## What is libXpm?

libXpm provides functions to read, write, and display images in the [X Pixmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap) (XPM) format.

XPM primarily aims to generate icon pixmaps with support for transparent pixels. It is based on the XBM syntax, and it can be either a plain text file in the XPM2 format or utilize a C programming language syntax, making it suitable for inclusion within a C program file.

## XPM image format – versions

### Predecessor – XBM

Before XPM (X PixMap) came to be in 1989, there was the XBM format (X BitMap).

A plain-text binary image format, used for storing icon and cursor bitmaps that were used in the X GUI.

XBM files are structured as C source files. This is their main distinction from most image formats around today. That way, they can be incorporated into applications directly. However, due to this and the fact no compression can be employed (1 character to 1-byte mapping), they are also far larger than their raw pixel data.

X BitMap (XBM) data comprises a sequence of static unsigned char arrays that store the raw monochrome pixel information.

For example, the following C code is the XBM file for `hello` in the image:

![3_hello Xbm image shown in XnView](data:image/svg+xml...)![3_hello Xbm image shown in XnView](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/16182814/3_hello-Xbm-image-shown-in-XnView.png)*‘hello’ Xbm image shown in XnView*

```
#define hello_width 35
#define hello_height 25
static char hello_bits[] = {
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10,
  0x00, 0x88, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x88, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x88,
  0x00, 0x00, 0xD0, 0xE1, 0x88, 0x78, 0x00, 0x30, 0x13, 0x89, 0xC4, 0x00,
  0x10, 0x12, 0x89, 0x84, 0x00, 0x10, 0xF2, 0x89, 0x84, 0x00, 0x10, 0x12,
  0x88, 0x84, 0x00, 0x10, 0x12, 0x88, 0x44, 0x00, 0x10, 0xE2, 0x89, 0x38,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
};
```

Instead of the usual image file-format headers, XBM files have `#define` statements. The first pair of values defines the pixel dimensions of the bitmap, indicating its height and width.

X BitMap (XBM) image data is structured as a continuous sequence of pixel values, which are stored within a static array. Given that each pixel is symbolized by a single bit (with 0 indicating white and 1 representing black), each byte in the array encompasses the data for eight individual pixels. Notably, the first byte’s least significant bit serves as the anchor for the upper-left pixel within the bitmap.

### XPM1

Meet XPM version 1.

First released in 1989, it shares a lot of similarities with the XBM format outlined above. While XBM was monochrome, XPM1 introduced colors to the images.

It uses additional macros and variables for colors and replaces bytes with characters for pixel data.

For example, here is the same `hello` black-and-white picture in the XPM1 format:

```
/* XPM */
static char *_hello[] = {
/* columns rows colors chars-per-pixel */
"35 25 2 1 ",
"  c white",
"b c black",
/* pixels */
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"    b              b   b           ",
"    b              b   b           ",
"    b              b   b           ",
"    b bbb    bbb   b   b   bbbb    ",
"    bb  bb  b   b  b   b  b   bb   ",
"    b    b  b   b  b   b  b    b   ",
"    b    b  bbbbb  b   b  b    b   ",
"    b    b  b      b   b  b    b   ",
"    b    b  b      b   b  b   b    ",
"    b    b   bbbb  b   b   bbb     ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   "
};
```

`XFACE_ncolors` here denotes the number of colors in the image, and `XFACE_chars_per_pixel`  denotes the number of characters per pixel.

Each `a` will be replaced by the white color “#ffffff”, and each `b` will be replaced by the black color “#000000”.

### XPM2

A year later, in 1990, the second version of the format was set to improve things. It simplified things and removed all C code from the image format.

The simplified structure:

```
! XPM2
<Header>
<Colors>
<Pixels>

```

The header line denotes the image dimensions similar to XPM1’s #define statements.

The colors section defines the character values.

A new type concept was introduced:

`c` – is for color pixel

`m` – is for monochrome

`g` – is for grayscale

`s` – is for symbolic

The symbolic feature is used to assign colors by context, and to create variable names for them for easier reading.

Example of an XPM2 image, with the same `hello` as shown in the previous examples:

```
! XPM2
35 25 2 1
a c #000000
b c #ffffff
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaabaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaabaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaabaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaababbbaaaabbbaaabaaabaaabbbbaaaa
aaaabbaabbaabaaabaabaaabaabaaabbaaa
aaaabaaaabaabaaabaabaaabaabaaaabaaa
aaaabaaaabaabbbbbaabaaabaabaaaabaaa
aaaabaaaabaabaaaaaabaaabaabaaaabaaa
aaaabaaaabaabaaaaaabaaabaabaaabaaaa
aaaabaaaabaaabbbbaabaaabaaabbbaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Apart from hexadecimal color codes, the colors can also be specified using any of the X11 color names (e.g. `red`), with `None` indicating transparency.

### XPM3

This is the current version of the XPM format.

The version, released in 1991, brought back the C code, but instead of using a pure C code style, the values inside are essentially the same as in the XPM2 format.

Example:

```
/* XPM */
static char *_hello[] = {
/* columns rows colors chars-per-pixel */
"35 25 2 1 ",
"  c white",
"b c black",
/* pixels */
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"                                   ",
"    b              b   b           ",
"    b              b   b           ",
"    b              b   b           ",

As discussed, the XPM format can also represent more sophisticated images, like the JFrog logo:

## DoS vulnerability – CVE-2023-43786

The CVE-2023-43786 vulnerability is essentially an endless loop resulting from an incorrect recursion stop condition calculation.

Fix commit: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/204c3393c4c90a29ed6bef64e43849536e863a86>

`XPutImage` is a function in libX11 that lets you place images onto an X Drawable, usually an X Window. With this function, one can transfer pixel information from an XImage structure to a designated drawable, like a window or a pixmap, and position it as needed.

### xpmCreatePixmapFromImage

The `xpmCreatePixmapFromImage` libXpm function calls for this `XPutImage` function:

```
void
xpmCreatePixmapFromImage(
    Display	*display,
    Drawable	 d,
    XImage	*ximage,
    Pixmap	*pixmap_return)
{
    GC gc;
    XGCValues values;

    *pixmap_return = XCreatePixmap(display, d, ximage->width,
				   ximage->height, ximage->depth);
    /* set fg and bg in case we have an XYBitmap */
    values.foreground = 1;
    values.background = 0;
    gc = XCreateGC(display, *pixmap_return,
		   GCForeground | GCBackground, &values);

    XPutImage(display, *pixmap_return, gc, ximage, 0, 0, 0, 0,
	      ximage->width, ximage->height);

    XFreeGC(display, gc);
}
```

In this function, `ximage` is the source image pixel data to be displayed and is copied to the `X Drawable` object (in this case `pixmap_return`).

### XPutImage

Here is the `XPutImage` libX11 function:

```
int
XPutImage (
    register Display *dpy,
    Drawable d,
    GC gc,
    register XImage *image,
    int req_xoffset,
    int req_yoffset,
    int x,
    int y,
    unsigned int req_width,
    unsigned int req_height)

{
                 .....
	    PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, &img, 0, 0, x, y,
			(unsigned int) width, (unsigned int) height,
			dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);
	    UnlockDisplay(dpy);
	    SyncHandle();
	    Xfree(img.data);
	    return 0;
	}
    }

    LockDisplay(dpy);
    FlushGC(dpy, gc);

    PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset, req_yoffset, x, y,
		(unsigned int) width, (unsigned int) height,
		dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);

   .........
}
```

It calls to the `PutSubImage` function:

```
static void
PutSubImage (
    register Display *dpy,
    Drawable d,
    GC gc,
    register XImage *image,
    int req_xoffset,
    int req_yoffset,
    int x, int y,
    unsigned int req_width,
    unsigned int req_height,
    int dest_bits_per_pixel,
    int dest_scanline_pad)
{
    int left_pad, BytesPerRow, Available;

    if ((req_width == 0) || (req_height == 0))
	return;

    Available = ((65536 < dpy->max_request_size) ? (65536 << 2)
                        : (dpy->max_request_size << 2)) - SIZEOF(xPutImageReq);
    if ((image->bits_per_pixel == 1) || (image->format != ZPixmap)) {               [1]
        left_pad = (image->xoffset + req_xoffset) & (dpy->bitmap_unit - 1);
        BytesPerRow = (ROUNDUP((long)req_width + left_pad,
                                dpy->bitmap_pad) >> 3) * image->depth;
    } else {                                                                        [2]
        left_pad = 0;
        BytesPerRow = ROUNDUP((long)req_width * dest_bits_per_pixel,                [3]
                                dest_scanline_pad) >> 3;
    }

    if ((BytesPerRow * req_height) <= Available) {                                  [4]
        PutImageRequest(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset, req_yoffset, x, y,
                        req_width, req_height,
                        dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);
    } else if (req_height > 1) {
        int SubImageHeight = Available / BytesPerRow;

        if (SubImageHeight == 0)
            SubImageHeight = 1;

        PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset, req_yoffset, x, y,
                    req_width, (unsigned int) SubImageHeight,
                    dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);

        PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset,
                    req_yoffset + SubImageHeight, x, y + SubImageHeight,
                    req_width, req_height - SubImageHeight,
                    dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);
    } else {                                                                        [5]
        int SubImageWidth = (((Available << 3) / dest_scanline_pad)                 [6]
                                * dest_scanline_pad) - left_pad;

        PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset, req_yoffset, x, y,
                    (unsigned int) SubImageWidth, 1,
                    dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);

        PutSubImage(dpy, d, gc, image, req_xoffset + SubImageWidth,
                    req_yoffset, x + SubImageWidth, y,
                    req_width - SubImageWidth, 1,
                    dest_bits_per_pixel, dest_scanline_pad);
    }
}

```
### Technical Vulnerability Details

Let’s take the following example image:

```
Available [the requested size] = (65,536 * 4) - 28 = 262,116
bits_per_pixel = 32
width = 90,000 pixels
height = 1 pixel
```

Since the image `bits_per_pixel` is 32, the conditional statement at [1] will not pass, leading us to enter the alternative code block defined in [2].

It then calculates the `BytesPerRow` on [3] then divides it by 8. In our example: BytesPerRow  = 90000 \* 32 / 8 = 360,000

In the example, the check on [4] would not pass, as 360000 is not less than the requested size 262116, and is not able to fit a single line of the requested width into a single request – this initiates the `else` on [5].

This determines the number of pixels that can be included in a single request. It then initiates a recursive call to the `PutSubImage` function to pass just that subset, followed by a subsequent recursive call to manage the remaining portion of the line. If needed, this remaining part may also be divided further through additional recursive calls.

However, the calculation on [6] fails to take into account the bits per pixel, and the recursive call makes requests sending 2096928 pixels instead of 2096928 bits – which is larger than can be fit in a single request.

This leads to **an endless loop of attempting to split the line of pixels**, consistently resulting in a number too large to fit and trying again the process to retry with the same values. This recursion persists until the call stack is exhausted.

The [bug fix](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/204c3393c4c90a29ed6bef64e43849536e863a86) changed the calculation on [6] and took into account the `bits_per_pixel`. In the example, it would result in a recursive call requesting to send just 65529 pixels, resulting in a BytesPerRow of 262116 that perfectly fits inside the available space, thus allowing the recursion to make forward progress and finish in just 2 calls.

Example proof-of-concept image to trigger the bug: <https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-CVE-2023-43786-libX11_DoS/blob/main/cve-2023-43786.xpm>

### How the bug can be triggered

An example of an app that calls the vulnerable libXpm library function is the CLI utility `sxpm`, which is used to display Xpm images on the screen.

It calls the vulnerable `xpmCreatePixmapFromImage` Xpm function, which then calls the vulnerable libX11 functions `XPutImage` then `PutSubImage`.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
