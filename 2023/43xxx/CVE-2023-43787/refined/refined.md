  "CVE-2023-43787": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in XCreateImage() leading to a heap overflow",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow within the XCreateImage() function. When creating an image, there was no validation that the multiplication of the caller-provided width by the visual's bits_per_pixel did not overflow, resulting in the allocation of a buffer too small to hold the data that would be copied into it. This can be triggered when parsing a malformed XPM image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening specially crafted XPM image files via libXpm",
         "Calling XCreateImage with a crafted width value"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to cause an application to process a specially crafted XPM image file that triggers the vulnerability."
