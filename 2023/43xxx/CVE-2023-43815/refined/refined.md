- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft version 2 when parsing the `wScreenDESCTextLen` field of a DPS file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `wScreenDESCTextLen` field in a DPS file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system running the vulnerable software.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted DPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to entice a user to open a malicious DPS file. The attacker can be anonymous and remote.
