- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `validateLicense` method in `com.hummer.system.service.LicenseService` concatenates user-uploaded file content into a command for license validation. The `CommandUtils#commonExecCmdWithResultNew` method uses `sh -c` to execute this constructed string, enabling arbitrary command execution.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Command injection: User-supplied input is directly included in a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping.
    - Use of `sh -c`: The use of `sh -c` allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by injecting them within the user-provided input.
  
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
  
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is through the `validateLicense` method by uploading a crafted file content to be processed.
  
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a file that is used in the license validation.
    - The vulnerability exists in the license validation functionality, which is likely to require authentication.
