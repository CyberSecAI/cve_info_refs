## Technical Details

### CVE-2023-43742 - Authentication Bypass in Administrator Service

In normal operation, the Zultys MX Administrator Windows client connects to port 7505 and attempts authentication, submitting the administrator username and password to the server. Upon authentication failure, the server sends a login failure message prompting the client to disconnect. However, if the client ignores the failure message instead and attempts to continue, the server does not forcibly close the connection and processes all subsequent requests from the client as if authentication had been successful.

### CVE-2023-43743 - Zultys MX: SQL Injection in Web Server

A filter parameter used for `/newapi/` requests in the Zultys MX web interface is vulnerable to authenticated SQL injection. Exploitation results in execution of arbitrary SQL on the backend database.

### CVE-2023-43744 - Zultys MX: OS Command Injection in Administrator Service

The Zultys MX Administrator client has a "Patch Manager" section that allows administrators to apply patches to the device. The user supplied filename for the patch file is passed to a shell script without validation. Including bash command substitution characters in a patch file name results in execution of the provided command.
