Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2023-43826: Apache Guacamole: Integer overflow in
 handling of VNC image buffers

Severity: important
Base CVSS Score: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected versions:

- Apache Guacamole through 1.5.3

Description:

Apache Guacamole 1.5.3 and older do not consistently ensure that values
received from a VNC server will not result in integer overflow. If a
user connects to a malicious or compromised VNC server, specially
crafted data could result in memory corruption, possibly allowing
arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd
process.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.5.4, which fixes this issue.

Credit:

We would like to thank Joseph Surin and Matt Jones (Elttam) for
reporting this issue.
