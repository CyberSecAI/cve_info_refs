- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft software when processing DPS files. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a malformed `wTextLen` field in the DPS file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on the `wTextLen` field when processing DPS files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on a system by enticing a user to open a specially crafted DPS file.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to create a malicious DPS file.
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicous DPS file with the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DPS file to a potential victim.
    - No authentication is required, but user interaction is necessary to open the crafted file.
