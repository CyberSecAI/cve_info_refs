Subject: Buildroot: Talos download hash verification vulnerabilities

Hello,

Talos recently published two vulnerability reports related to the hash
verification of sources downloaded by Buildroot. These issues are fixed
in Buildroot 2023.02.8 / 2023.08.4 / 2023.11.

The reports are:

<https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1844>

CVE-2023-45841,CVE-2023-45842,CVE-2023-45838,CVE-2023-45839,CVE-2023-45840

Multiple data integrity vulnerabilities exist in the package hash
checking functionality of Buildroot 2023.08.1 and Buildroot dev commit
622698d7847. A specially crafted man-in-the-middle attack can lead to
arbitrary command execution in the builder.

And:

<https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1845>

CVE-2023-43608

A data integrity vulnerability exists in the BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR
functionality of Buildroot 2023.08.1 and dev commit 622698d7847. A
specially crafted man-in-the-middle attack can lead to arbitrary command
execution in the builder.

A summary describing the fixes and new features for handling download
hashes for custom package locations and versions has been posted to the
mailing list:

[https://lore.kernel.org/buildroot/87y1e7sq4u.fsf@48ers.dk/T/#u](https://lore.kernel.org/buildroot/87y1e7sq4u.fsf%4048ers.dk/T/#u)

(Included here in full):

Talos recently reported a number of security vulnerabilities in the
package download hash checking in Buildroot, and these are now public
at:

<https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1844>
<https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1845>

A small number of packages did not have a .hash file, meaning that the
downloaded sources were not verified - And for aufs + aufs-util they
were downloaded from a http:// site, so conceptually vulnerable to a man
in the middle attack.

aufs/aufs-utils were changed to fetch from https by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/f2a590750f5bedcee48ce7beb8f35356b42eda11>
<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/99d525028f969220719a4e6bcd694f7d9cfd5b67>

The fallback download location on source.buildroot.net was changed to
use https:// by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/05296ced369bab8877efa624f3d9b4d201ba5b38>

Hash files for riscv64-elf-toolchain and mxsldr were added by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/cf2dcaa1ecede670a0bc54841652a0e3bea5c744>
<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/fefcfddc5e6a265c66adbdff615558f99133f148>

Which are all included in 2023.02.7 / 2023.08.3 / 2023.11.

Some packages allow a custom version or even a custom upstream location
(E.G. Linux, U-Boot, versal-firmware, ..). For those custom versions
Buildroot naturally cannot provide the expected hash, so instead we have
added support for providing hashes for those files in the
BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR location and added a
BR2_DOWNLOAD_FORCE_CHECK_HASHES option to enforce hash checking (and
fail if missing/invalid) for all downloads. This was added by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/5d36710e36fc4698c8fae71675bcff7395246006>
<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/e091e31831122b60b084bd755e94df4dfe7188d2>

To make it easier to manage these custom hash files a
utils/add-custom-hashes helper script has been added by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/4984d0f230d0962270beb195966603f1d5a56300>

Which are all included in 2023.02.7 / 2023.08.3 / 2023.11.

See the documentation for further details about this feature:

<https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_adding_project_specific_patches_and_hashes>

Notice that it is up to the user of Buildroot to use this feature to
protect their custom downloads!

Finally the toradex_apalis_imx6_defconfig fetched Linux and U-Boot from
a git:// URL, so custom hashes were added in the BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR
for those by:

<https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/commit/cdc9b8a3a75c4c39f23feb4e3b0e296786e0132c>

Which is included in 2023.02.8 / 2023.08.4 / 2023.11.

Thanks to Talos for discovering and reporting these issues to us and to
Yann E. MORIN for implementing the custom hash logic.

## Buildroot BR\_NO\_CHECK\_HASH\_FOR data integrity vulnerability

##### December 5, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-43608

##### SUMMARY

A data integrity vulnerability exists in the BR\_NO\_CHECK\_HASH\_FOR functionality of Buildroot 2023.08.1 and dev commit 622698d7847. A specially crafted man-in-the-middle attack can lead to arbitrary command execution in the builder.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Buildroot 2023.08.1

Buildroot dev commit 622698d7847

##### PRODUCT URLS

Buildroot - <https://www.buildroot.org/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-494 - Download of Code Without Integrity Check

##### DETAILS

Buildroot is a tool that automates builds of Linux environments for embedded systems. It supports cross-compiling for multiple target platforms and allows for building a cross-compilation toolchain, Linux kernel image, boot loader, root file system and various utilities.

When building a package, Buildroot executes the corresponding Makefile. Source code is typically downloaded from the internet for most packages, while some are included within Buildroot. Upon downloading the source, Buildroot verifies the integrity of the package using a hash file, extracts the sources, applies any necessary patches and then proceeds with the actual building process.

To describe the logic in detail, let’s use the `strace` package as a simple example:

In `package/strace/strace.mk`:

```
STRACE_VERSION = 6.5
STRACE_SOURCE = strace-$(STRACE_VERSION).tar.xz
STRACE_SITE = https://github.com/strace/strace/releases/download/v$(STRACE_VERSION)
...
$(eval $(autotools-package))

```

In `package/strace/strace.hash`:

```
# Locally calculated after checking signature with RSA key 0xA8041FA839E16E36
# https://strace.io/files/6.5/strace-6.5.tar.xz.asc
sha256  dfb051702389e1979a151892b5901afc9e93bbc1c70d84c906ade3224ca91980  strace-6.5.tar.xz
sha256  d92f973d08c8466993efff1e500453add0c038c20b4d2cbce3297938a296aea9  COPYING
sha256  7c379436436a562834aa7d2f5dcae1f80a25230fa74201046ca1fba4367d39aa  LGPL-2.1-or-later

```

`STRACE_SITE` defines the external site to fetch the sources from and `STRACE_SOURCE` defines the actual package name to retrieve. The `autotools-package` is then evaluated to interpret the various `<PACKAGE_NAME>_<VARIABLE>` definitions defined in the package `.mk` and generate all the Makefiles rules needed to build the package.

In the `.hash` file, we can see sha256 hashes for any file that is being downloaded externally so their integrity can be verified after download.

When the `strace` package is selected in the config, calling `make strace-source` will download the package sources. The download function is defined in `package/pkg-download.mk`, which relays the request to the `support/download/dl-wrapper` shell script.

In the case of `strace`, `dl-wrapper` is called like this:

```
support/download/dl-wrapper
    -c 6.4
    -d /opt/buildroot/dl/strace
    -D /opt/buildroot/dl
    -f strace-6.4.tar.xz
    -H package/strace//strace.hash
    -n strace-6.4
    -N strace
    -o /opt/buildroot/dl/strace/strace-6.4.tar.xz
    -u https+https://github.com/strace/strace/releases/download/v6.4
    -u http|urlencode+http://sources.buildroot.net/strace
    -u http|urlencode+http://sources.buildroot.net

```

Interesting parameters to note:

* `-H` defines the `.hash` file for integrity checks
* `-u` can be specified multiple times, to provide a fallback in case the primary URL is not available

The `http://sources.buildroot.net` URLs have been passed as fallback because they correspond to the default value of `BR2_BACKUP_SITE`. This behavior is enabled by default. However, it is possible to set `BR2_PRIMARY_SITE_ONLY` to disable it and only allow downloads from the primary resource.

Inside `dl-wrapper`:

```
    ...
    download_and_check=0
    rc=1
[1] for uri in "${uris[@]}"; do
        backend_urlencode="${uri%%+*}"
        backend="${backend_urlencode%|*}"
        case "${backend}" in
            git|svn|cvs|bzr|file|scp|hg|sftp) ;;
            *) backend="wget" ;;
        esac
        uri=${uri#*+}

        ...
[2]     if ! "${OLDPWD}/support/download/${backend}" \
                $([ -n "${urlencode}" ] && printf %s '-e') \
                -c "${cset}" \
                -d "${dl_dir}" \
                -n "${raw_base_name}" \
                -N "${base_name}" \
                -f "${filename}" \
                -u "${uri}" \
                -o "${tmpf}" \
                ${quiet} ${large_file} ${recurse} -- "${@}"
        then
            ...
            continue
        fi

        ...
        # Check if the downloaded file is sane, and matches the stored hashes
        # for that file
[3]     if support/download/check-hash ${quiet} "${hfile}" "${tmpf}" "${output##*/}"; then
            rc=0
        else
            if [ ${?} -ne 3 ]; then
                rm -rf "${tmpd}"
                continue
            fi

            # the hash file exists and there was no hash to check the file
            # against
            rc=1
        fi
[4]     download_and_check=1
        break
    done

    # We tried every URI possible, none seems to work or to check against the
    # available hash. *ABORT MISSION*
[5] if [ "${download_and_check}" -eq 0 ]; then
        rm -rf "${tmpd}"
        exit 1
    fi

```

For each URL (specified via `-u`) [1], the appropriate backend is used. In the case of `strace` the backend is simply `wget`, so `wget` is going to be called via the `support/download/wget` wrapper [2].

After the file is downloaded, the hash is checked (file is specified via `-H`) by calling `check-hash` [3]. If `check-hash` has a 0 exit status, `rc` is set to 0, `download_and_check` [4, 5] is set to 1 to indicate success and the loop ends.

Let’s see how `check-hash` is implemented.

```
    ...
    # Does the hash-file exist?
[6] if [ ! -f "${h_file}" ]; then
        printf "WARNING: no hash file for %s\n" "${base}" >&2
        exit 0
    fi

    # Check one hash for a file
    # $1: algo hash
    # $2: known hash
    # $3: file (full path)
    check_one_hash() {
        ... # exits with error code if the hash doesn't match
    }

    # Do we know one or more hashes for that file?
    nb_checks=0
    while read t h f; do
        case "${t}" in
            ''|'#'*)
                # Skip comments and empty lines
                continue
                ;;
            *)
                if [ "${f}" = "${base}" ]; then
[7]                 check_one_hash "${t}" "${h}" "${file}"
                    : $((nb_checks++))
                fi
                ;;
        esac
    done <"${h_file}"

[8] if [ ${nb_checks} -eq 0 ]; then
[9]     case " ${BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR} " in
        *" ${base} "*)
            # File explicitly has no hash
            exit 0
            ;;
        esac
        printf "ERROR: No hash found for %s\n" "${base}" >&2
        exit 3
    fi

```

For each hash line in the `.hash` file, `check_one_hash` is called [7]. If the `hash` doesn’t match, `check_one_hash` will exit with an error code. Otherwise `nb_checks` is incremented to indicate one successful check. If there’s no entry in the `.hash` file for the specified input file to check, the check at [8] will return an error unless `BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR` [9] contains this specific file, meaning that the file is excluded from hash checks.

In total, there are 3 ways for `check-hash` to return 0 (success):

1. no `.hash` file exists for the package [6]
2. the `$file`’s hash matches the definition in the `.hash` file [7]
3. the `$file` is not present in the `.hash` file and `BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR` contains the base name for the package (explicitly skipping checks) [9]

Option 2 is what we expect to reach most of the time.

In this advisory, we focus on Option 3. This seems to be commonly used to skip integrity checks for resources that can’t be easily hashed (for example, developement resources that change often). It is also used when building specific versions of a package, for which hashes may not be available in Buildroot’s sources.

For example, the Linux Kernel Buildroot Makefile (`linux/linux.mk`):

```
...
ifeq ($(BR2_LINUX_KERNEL)$(BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LATEST_VERSION),y)
    BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR += $(LINUX_SOURCE)
endif
...

```

If both `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL` and `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LATEST_VERSION` where enabled, the result of `$(BR2_LINUX_KERNEL)$(BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LATEST_VERSION)` would be `yy`.

So, the `ifeq` checks if `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LATEST_VERSION` is NOT selected, in which case it adds `linux-<version>-br1.tar.gz` to the `BR_NO_CHECK_HASH_FOR` variable.

This is, however, problematic in some setups. For example, consider this Buildroot minimal configuration:

```
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_GIT=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_URL="https://192.168.50.50"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_VERSION="123"

```

This defines a custom repository for fetching the Linux Kernel, so it may be important to only fetch the sources from that repository, for Linux specifically. This will work fine the majority of the time. However, if an attacker is able to drop connections towards 192.168.50.50, this will make the `if` condition at [2] fail, and the loop at [1] will perform the download using the next `$uri`. The next `$uri` is going to be `http://sources.buildroot.net/linux/linux-123-br1.tar.gz`, because of the default `BR2_BACKUP_SITE` variable. This will lead to downloading Linux Kernel sources via plain HTTP without performing any hash checks.

Since the Linux Kernel can ship patch files or Makefiles, by supplying a compromised source package, an attacker would be able to execute arbitrary commands in the builder. As a direct consequence, an attacker could then also tamper with any file generated for Buildroot’s targets and hosts.

For example, it’s enough to provide a Makefile with the following command:

```
_ := $(shell id >> /injected)

```

Or insert such a line in a `.patch` file, which would allow modification of any package within Buildroot during the build process.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

This proof-of-concept assumes that an attacker is MITM-ing the network and dropping requests to `192.168.50.50`, while at the same time serving any `.tar.gz` file requested via port 80 with a malicious version:

```
