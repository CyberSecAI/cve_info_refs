Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the saved search feature of GLPI. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the user-controlled parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when creating saved searches, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries. This can be exploited via the saved search feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to access sensitive information stored within the database by executing arbitrary SQL queries, potentially exposing confidential data.
- **Integrity Impact:** While the provided advisory states "Integrity: None", SQL injection could potentially be leveraged for data modification, though the immediate impact described is limited to data exfiltration.
- **Availability Impact:** The advisory states "Availability: None". While direct denial of service might not be the immediate impact, attackers may be able to interfere with normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the GLPI application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges, meaning a regular authenticated user account is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction beyond the attacker using their own account.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects GLPI versions >= 10.0.0.
- The issue is fixed in version 10.0.11.
- The provided commit `4bd7f02d940953b9cbc9d285f7544bb0e490e75e` shows the patch introduced to fix the issue in `ajax/pin_savedsearches.php`. While the patch itself doesn't directly sanitize the input leading to the injection, it's part of a larger fix included in the 10.0.11 release which addresses the SQL injection issue within the saved search feature.

In summary, CVE-2023-43813 is an authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability in GLPI that could allow attackers to potentially access sensitive data from the database.
