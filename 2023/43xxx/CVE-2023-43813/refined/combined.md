## This is a security release, upgrading is recommended

[![Download it](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/68b90902201c2efd879051a624e1cf45a0c5cb2d86ea609465b972367e179850/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f31302e302e31312d444f574e4c4f41445f474c50492d677265656e2e7376673f6c6f676f3d706870266c6f676f436f6c6f723d7768697465267374796c653d666f722d7468652d6261646765)](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/10.0.11/glpi-10.0.11.tgz)

This release fixes a few security issues that have been recently discovered. Update is **recommended!**

You can download the [GLPI 10.0.11 archive](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/10.0.11/glpi-10.0.11.tgz) on GitHub.

You will find below the list of security issues fixed in this bugfixes version:

* [SECURITY - moderate] Authenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2023-43813)
* [SECURITY - high] SQL injection through inventory agent request (CVE-2023-46727)
* [SECURITY - high] Remote code execution from LDAP server configuration form on PHP 7.4 (CVE-2023-46726)

On this last point, we wanted to recall the 7.4 version of PHP is very outdated and [not supported anymore](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) by the developers!

You should upgrade on a recent version, at least 8.2 (8.0 will be outdated at the end of the year and 8.1 will be only with security fixes).

Also, here is a short list of main changes done in this version:

* [UX] Enhance pending reasons display
* [FIX] various LDAP fixes (timeout, location import, deletion/restoration scenarios)
* [FIX] several inventory fixes (unmanaged assets reconciliation, rules for phones, rules logs for discovery, Cisco stacks, removal of remote management)
* [FIX] several performance enhancements (defer entity tree loading, strong enhancement on actors loading, all assets query execution time, web cron removal, dual ajax call for tab loading)
* [TASK] highlights of security requirements on install/update page. Some options like PHP versions, web folder setup are suggested with a strong visual.

The [full changelog is available](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/milestone/63?closed=1) for more details.

We would like to thank all people who contributed to this new version and all those who contributes regularly to the GLPI project!

Regards.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
