{
  "CVE-2023-43665": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The regular expressions used in the implementation of django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods (with html=True) exhibited linear backtracking complexity. This resulted in slow evaluation and potential denial of service when given a very long, potentially malformed HTML input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Linear backtracking complexity in regular expressions",
      "Denial-of-service vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) due to slow evaluation of regular expressions when processing very long or malformed HTML input.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a very long, potentially malformed HTML input to the vulnerable chars() and words() methods of django.utils.text.Truncator, or the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted HTML input that will be processed by the vulnerable code. No special privileges are needed."
