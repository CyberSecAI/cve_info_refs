**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Dell Rugged Control Center versions prior to 4.7 have insufficient protection for the Policy folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to have a standard user account on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Standard User Account:** The attacker must have a local standard user account on the system where Dell Rugged Control Center is installed.
