## 4. MITIGATIONS

Weintek recommends users follow their [Upgrade Instructions](https://dl.weintek.com/public/Document/UM0/UM018010E_cMT_Series_OS_Update_Instructions_eng.pdf) to update the following products to the latest versions:

* cMT-FHD: OS version 20210211
* cMT-HDM: OS version 20210205
* cMT3071: OS version 20210219
* cMT3072: OS version 20210219
* cMT3103: OS version 20210219
* cMT3090: OS version 20210219
* cMT3151: OS version 20210219

For additional information, refer to [Weintek's security bulletin](https://dl.weintek.com/public/Document/TEC/TEC23005E_cMT_Web_Security_Update.pdf).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.

20210204 (and previous

versions)

20210208 (and previous

versions)

According to ICSA-23-285-12, web-related security issues are addressed on listed devices.

The web-related are miscellaneous scripts for maintaining the HMIs.

By combining those issues together, a remote attacker may gain access to the system or

remotely execute commands without authentication via the web server whose OS version is

listed as affected.

If the device mentioned above is connected an open network, meaning the device can be

accessed by anyone, we strongly suggest customers to:

(1) Disconnect the device from the open network

(2) Upgrade the OS of the device

Find Current OS Version

OS version is available on the web page as shown below, or for HMIs with screen, OS version

is also available via on-screen system setting:

Solution

If these devices are exposed to an open network, like below, we strongly suggest customers

disconnect the device from the network and upgrade the operating system (OS).

If these devices are not connected to an open network, they may not be affected but we still

suggest customers upgrade the OS.

We have prepared OS upgrade images for the affected products. After downloading the

corresponding images, please follow the OS upgrade guide carefully. Do not power cycle the

device during the update as the update will be broken and the device may be broken.

OS Update Instructions – Step by Step

1.  Copy the OS image (.bin) to a folder in a USB drive. In this example, the OS image is

saved in the root directory of the USB drive. (The format of the external storage device

should be FAT32.)

2.  Plug the USB drive into the HMI. If a window pops up and prompts for download/upload,

click close to dismiss it.

4.  Press the lock icon

, enter the correct password and then press “System setting”. The

default password is 111111.

5.  Scroll the menu and find “OS upgrade.”

6.  Press the folder icon   and then navigate to the folder containing the OS image. In this

example, locate the OS image in the root directory and then click OK.

7.  Click “Upgrade” in the top right corner.

8.  OS upgrade will begin, which may take a short while. Do not unplug the HMI when

upgrading, as doing so may result in all data being lost. The progress bar indicates the

progress of the OS upgrade. Reboot the HMI following the OS upgrade.
