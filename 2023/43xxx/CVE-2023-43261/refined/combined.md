# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

Hello, World! ❤️

Today, I have an exciting story about how I exposed admin passwords and gained access to thousands of **3G/4G/5G Industrial Cellular Routers** with the help of some old-school vulnerabilities (or rather, misconfigurations).

> Before proceeding please note that the **following vulnerabilities have been immediately identified and fixed**. The manufacturer proactively communicated the vulnerability situation and promptly updated the software to address the vulnerability risks. **I confirm that this issue has been resolved by August 2023 without any negative impact. Therefore, the following vulnerability content is for discussion and research purposes only.**

## CHAPTER 1

# Accidental Discovery

A few months back, I shared a search trick on GitHub that allowed you to find thousands of leaked keys and secrets from public repositories. You can check out that search syntax [right here](https://gist.github.com/win3zz/0a1c70589fcbea64dba4588b93095855). As I was experimenting with it, I realized it could be turned into a **Google Dork**.

Google Dork is basically a clever search query that you can use on Google to discover hidden, sensitive information on the internet. Here’s the special Google Dork I came up with:

`site:*.*:8080 (ext:json OR ext:properties OR ext:sql OR ext:txt OR ext:log OR ext:tmp OR ext:backup OR ext:bak OR ext:enc OR ext:yml OR ext:yaml OR ext:toml OR ext:ini OR ext:config OR ext:conf OR ext:cfg OR ext:env OR ext:envrc OR ext:prod OR ext:secret OR ext:private OR ext:key)`

Pretty simple, right? This small piece of code will help me find sensitive files like SQL, config, backups, logs, etc., on a web server running on port 8080, exposed to the world.

![]()

As a result, I came across the website http://[REDACTED]:8080/lang/log/system.log. Upon visiting this website, I discovered that it was **publicly disclosing system logs, which included internal information.**

![]()

By deleting `system.log` from the URL and navigating back to one directory, I noticed **a server misconfiguration that allowed me to view the contents or list of files within that particular directory.** In this directory, I found an interesting log file named `httpd.log`.

![]()

Upon reviewing its contents, I identified that **usernames and encrypted passwords were being logged.** 😲

![]()

Further, I observed that the application’s login page is accessible via http://[REDACTED]:8080/.

![]()

From a quick Google search, I found out that Ursalink is a manufacturer of IoT products in the industrial sector. It was a vendor of remote monitoring, data collection, and automation devices for use in various industrial applications.

I guessed it might be a router login. Upon closer examination of the login page, I came to know that it utilized a JavaScript file called `login.js`.

![]()

What’s the big deal with `login.js`, you ask? Well, this JavaScript file revealed that the application was encrypting passwords client-side using the **CryptoJS library** and then sending them to the server.

Upon analyzing the JavaScript code, I determined that the **application was using the AES algorithm in CBC Cipher mode, with a hardcoded secret key and initialization vector (IV).** Here is a formatted version of the same JavaScript code snippet:

```
$("#login").click(function() {
    var e = $("#username").val(),
        n = $("#password").val();
    if (0 == e.length) return void $(".error").html(language_class.login.error.username);
    if (0 == n.length) return void $(".error").html(language_class.login.error.password);
    var o = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("1111111111111111"),
        t = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("2222222222222222"),
        l = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(n),
        i = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(l, o, {
            iv: t,
            mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
        });
    n = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(i.ciphertext.toString()
        .toUpperCase()));
```

To further investigate, I quickly created a decryption code and successfully decrypted the previously copied password. Here is the decryption code I used:

```
console.log(CryptoJS.AES.decrypt("vUZ6I78zsJ/3X8a/60GTvg==",
  CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("1111111111111111"), {
      iv: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("2222222222222222"),
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
      padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  }).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
```

The decrypted password that I obtained was: **electrasystems1**

![]()

But would this password actually get me inside the application? To validate the severity of this vulnerability, I attempted to log into the application using the username and cleartext password.

![]()

Surprise! **I successfully gained unauthorized access to the router.**

My guess was right, I concluded from the model number that it is an **Industrial Cellular Router**.

![]()

UR75 V1, a first-generation Industrial Cellular Router model

Along with this, I also did port scanning using `nmap` and found 4 open ports including TCP port 22.

![]()

With the help of the same credentials, **I managed to log in to the router console using SSH**.

![]()

To find the owner of the router or the linked organization, I used [bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/) to get the information associated with the IP address. Through this process, I determined that the IP address is linked with Telus Communications Inc., a Canadian telecom company.

After a little analysis and gathering information from the internet, I concluded that the IP address is assigned by Telus to the SIM card inside the cellular router. Therefore, it is quite difficult to get SIM-owner/router-owner information to inform/notify about this issue.

![]()
# But I wasn’t done yet!

I wanted to see if other routers were also vulnerable. I queried again with the new Google Dorks `"/lang/log/system" ext:log`, `"URSALINK" "English" "Login"` and confirmed that a bunch of routers were also vulnerable.

![]()

**Google Dork**`: "/lang/log/system" ext:log`

![]()

**Google Dork**`: "URSALINK" "English" "Login"`

I was not satisfied with the limited results, so I used the [Shodan Search Engine](https://www.shodan.io/) to get more such routers using the `http.html:rt_title` search query filter.

![]()

It returned over 5500 results! 🎣 I downloaded all the Shodan results, filtered and exported them into a text file.

**Command**: `shodan parse --fields ip_str,port --separator ":" shodan_results.json.gz > ursalink_ip.txt`

Using `httpx`, exported URLs of all vulnerable router web interfaces by requesting the `/lang/log/httpd.log` endpoint.

**Command**: `httpx -l ursalink_ip.txt -x HEAD -path "/lang/log/httpd.log" -sc -title -location -cl -ct -csv -o ursalink_vulnerable_hosts.csv`

To demonstrate the impact, and verify the vulnerability at scale, I created a Python script to test all of those results, and you can find it in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/win3zz/CVE-2023-43261).

The script allows the testing of a router’s console URL or a list of URLs from a text file and quickly retrieves the admin password. Passed the result of the vulnerable list of URLs to my script and observed cleartext admin credentials.

![]()

As a result — most routers were vulnerable, and I collected administrator credentials. I even logged in to a few devices as proof. I identified that the Ursalink Industrial Cellular Router series UR5X, UR32L, UR32, UR35, and UR41 were vulnerable and others may also be vulnerable.

This vulnerability becomes even more severe as **some routers allow the sending and receiving of SMS messages.** An attacker could exploit this functionality for fraudulent activities, potentially causing financial harm to the router owner.

![]()

After logging in, go to **General Settings** in the **System** menu, and access the **SMS** tab for messaging.

![]()

SMS received from a Malaysian number

I started investigating the router manufacturer Ursalink. I learned that previously the manufacturer of this device was a Chinese company called Xiamen Ursalink Technology Co., Ltd., but then they merged with Milesight, and now they operate as **Milesight IoT Co., Ltd.**

I reached out to the company through email at iot.support@milesight.com and [Help Desk/Support](https://support.milesight-iot.com/support/home) to report this vulnerability.

In my communication with them, I explained to them why **system logs, such as** `system.log` **and** `httpd.log`**, should not be publicly accessible**. I recommended the implementation of appropriate access controls to limit their exposure.

Additionally, I stressed the need to **avoid the practice of hardcoding keys or IVs** within the application code. While I acknowledged that the encryption layer was intended to provide an extra layer of security on top of TLS, I pointed out that its current implementation might not be as effective as intended. **This encryption could be easily cracked and introduce unnecessary overhead to both the browser and the application, affecting overall performance.** Therefore, I suggested reconsidering the necessity of this layer or exploring alternative, more secure algorithm implementations.

In response to my report, the company thanked me for the detailed report and confirmed that the vulnerability was a known issue. They assured me that the vulnerability had already been resolved/fixed in their latest firmware. They also provided the latest firmware version for verification purposes.

## CHAPTER 2

# The Art of Firmware Emulation

In this chapter, I won’t be able to share the findings or other confidential details, but I’m excited to share some essential steps with you. If you’ve ever found yourself in a similar situation, dealing with firmware and emulation, this may be the insight you need.

So, I received a firmware file named **35.3.0.7.bin**. Using the `file 35.3.0.7.bin` command, I found out that it is a zip archive. Running `binwalk 35.3.0.7.bin`, I found that this file was encrypted/password-protected and it contained two compressed files: router.tar and upgrade\_tool.tar.gz.

1. `router.tar` was the big deal here; it held all the crucial firmware components like the kernel and file system.
2. On the other hand, `upgrade_tool.tar.gz` wasn’t as important. It contained some scripts to extract the firmware data from `router.tar` and perform a system upgrade.

![]()

I decrypted `35.3.0.7.bin` and extracted some important files, namely `filesystem.squashfs`, `ur35.dtb`, and `zImage_signed.bin`, all from the `router.tar`. But then, the question was, “**How do I use these files?**”

One approach considered was using `binwalk -Me filesystem.squashfs` to extract the contents of a Squashfs filesystem for analysis, but since it doesn’t allow program execution within the filesystem, I opted not to proceed with it.

![]()

I didn’t have access to the physical device (which happened to be an Industrial Cellular Router). So, **I decided to attempt emulating the provided firmware on my Debian Linux (Ubuntu) machine using a tool called** [**QEMU**](https://www.qemu.org/) **(Quick Emulator)**, the generic open-source emulator and virtualizer.

Now, emulating router firmware directly on a Linux Debian system isn’t exactly a walk in the park. You see, router firmware is designed for embedded systems with different CPU architectures (like ARM or MIPS) than what a typical Linux Debian system uses (x86 or x86\_64). After reading the router’s specifications, I found out that this particular router used a **32-bit ARM architecture.**

![]()

Emulating one architecture on another can be difficult and requires tools like QEMU, which can be a bit of a hassle to set up.

So, I rolled up my sleeves and installed QEMU for ARM with the command `sudo apt install qemu-system-arm`. You can choose between `qemu-system-arm` or `qemu-system-aarch64` to simulate a 32-bit ARM machine. **QEMU’s ARM system emulation requires you to specify a board model using the** `-M` **or** `-machine` **option.** This is where `ur35.dtb` file comes into play, the file I extracted earlier from the router.

To access the content of the **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** file I require a tool that can interpret and extract information from DTB files. The **Device Tree Compiler (DTC)** is a tool that can convert DTB files to a human-readable **Device Tree Source (DTS)** format. To get it, just run `sudo apt install device-tree-compiler`. Using the DTC tool I converted the DTB file to DTS format with the help of the following command: `dtc -I dtb -O dts -o ur35.dts ur35.dtb`.

![]()![]()

A quick look at `ur35.dts` showed that the model was “**Freescale i.MX6 UltraLite 14x14 EVK Board”**.

![]()

This is what the **i.MX6UltraLite Evaluation Kit (EVK)** board looks like

Next, I needed to select a machine or board model for QEMU. I found it by running `qemu-system-arm -machine help | grep i.MX6`, which led me to choose the “**mcimx6ul-evk**” board.

![]()
# We’re getting closer!

With everything set up, my ultimate goal was to gain access to the root shell and the router’s administration web panel. This would allow me to analyze how it handled user input (debugging) and find potential vulnerabilities.

Putting all the pieces together, I came up with the following command:

`qemu-system-arm -M mcimx6ul-evk -kernel zImage_signed.bin -initrd filesystem.squashfs -append “root=/dev/ram0 init=init” -dtb ur35.dtb -nographic -no-reboot`

**Let’s break down the command step by step:**

1. `qemu-system-arm`: This is the QEMU command to run a virtual machine with an ARM-based processor architecture.
2. `-M mcimx6ul-evk`: This specifies the machine or board model to emulate. In this case, it’s set to emulate the “**mcimx6ul-evk**” board.
3. `-kernel zImage_signed.bin`: This option specifies the kernel image file to be loaded into the virtual machine. “**zImage\_signed.bin**” is the kernel image that will be used.
4. `-initrd filesystem.squashfs`: This option specifies the initial ramdisk (initrd) image file to be loaded into the virtual machine. It contains an initial file system that can be used during the boot process. In this case, it’s “**filesystem.squashfs**”
5. `-append “root=/dev/ram0 init=init”`: This option provides a kernel command line that will be passed to the kernel during boot. It specifies two boot parameters: **1.** `root=/dev/ram0`— This sets the root filesystem to be loaded from RAM (/dev/ram0) initially. **2.** `init=init` — It instructs the kernel to execute the traditional init process as the initial user-space program during boot
6. `-dtb ur35.dtb`: This option specifies the device tree binary (DTB) file to be used. Device tree files describe the hardware configuration to the kernel, and “ur35.dtb” is the one specified here.
7. `-nographic`: This option tells QEMU to operate without a graphical user interface (GUI). It’s useful for text-based or headless operations.
8. `-no-reboot`: This option tells QEMU not to automatically restart the virtual machine if it shuts down. This can be helpful when debugging or testing specific scenarios.

I was able to partially emulate the firmware using this command but was still unable to run the server and access the web admin panel on the host machine. I faced numerous challenges and made countless adjustments to my final command.

Now, I won’t bore you with all the twists and turns, but let me tell you, I tinkered with configurations and parameters in my final command until it was just right. And after a few failed attempts (hey, it was my first time emulating firmware), I cracked the code!

![]()

**A snapshot version of** [**LEDE “Reboot”**](https://openwrt.org/releases/17.01/start) **was running on the system**. LEDE (Linux Embedded Development Environment) merged with the OpenWrt project in early 2018. [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) is an open-source project that provides a Linux-based operating system (OS) and firmware for embedded devices, particularly routers and network devices.

I was more interested in web admin. The web admin interface details can typically be found in a configuration file. I began to inspect the router’s configuration file to find relevant details.

![]()

After a little digging, I found a configuration file for the [**uHTTPd web server**](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/webserver/http.uhttpd), which is commonly used for web admin interfaces on OpenWrt-based systems.

I was looking for the controller file like `file-export` that was handling HTTP requests.

![]()

I found those files in `/www/cgi-bin/`directory.

![]()

Those handler files were symbolic links pointing to `/usr/libexec/luci2-io`

![]()

I extracted the `luci2-io` binary file from the firmware and started analyzing it using [**Ghidra**](https://ghidra-sre.org/)**.**

![]()

After some debugging and analysis, I found several vulnerabilities, but due to company confidentiality, I can’t share them here.

Lastly, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to [**Milesight**](https://www.milesight.com/) for their proper coordination and for providing the firmware.

Hello, World! ❤️

Today, I have an exciting story about how I exposed admin passwords and gained access to thousands of **3G/4G/5G Industrial Cellular Routers** with the help of some old-school vulnerabilities (or rather, misconfigurations).

> Before proceeding please note that the **following vulnerabilities have been immediately identified and fixed**. The manufacturer proactively communicated the vulnerability situation and promptly updated the software to address the vulnerability risks. **I confirm that this issue has been resolved by August 2023 without any negative impact. Therefore, the following vulnerability content is for discussion and research purposes only.**

## CHAPTER 1

# Accidental Discovery

A few months back, I shared a search trick on GitHub that allowed you to find thousands of leaked keys and secrets from public repositories. You can check out that search syntax [right here](https://gist.github.com/win3zz/0a1c70589fcbea64dba4588b93095855). As I was experimenting with it, I realized it could be turned into a **Google Dork**.

Google Dork is basically a clever search query that you can use on Google to discover hidden, sensitive information on the internet. Here’s the special Google Dork I came up with:

`site:*.*:8080 (ext:json OR ext:properties OR ext:sql OR ext:txt OR ext:log OR ext:tmp OR ext:backup OR ext:bak OR ext:enc OR ext:yml OR ext:yaml OR ext:toml OR ext:ini OR ext:config OR ext:conf OR ext:cfg OR ext:env OR ext:envrc OR ext:prod OR ext:secret OR ext:private OR ext:key)`

Pretty simple, right? This small piece of code will help me find sensitive files like SQL, config, backups, logs, etc., on a web server running on port 8080, exposed to the world.

![]()

As a result, I came across the website http://[REDACTED]:8080/lang/log/system.log. Upon visiting this website, I discovered that it was **publicly disclosing system logs, which included internal information.**

![]()

By deleting `system.log` from the URL and navigating back to one directory, I noticed **a server misconfiguration that allowed me to view the contents or list of files within that particular directory.** In this directory, I found an interesting log file named `httpd.log`.

![]()

Upon reviewing its contents, I identified that **usernames and encrypted passwords were being logged.** 😲

![]()

Further, I observed that the application’s login page is accessible via http://[REDACTED]:8080/.

![]()

From a quick Google search, I found out that Ursalink is a manufacturer of IoT products in the industrial sector. It was a vendor of remote monitoring, data collection, and automation devices for use in various industrial applications.

I guessed it might be a router login. Upon closer examination of the login page, I came to know that it utilized a JavaScript file called `login.js`.

![]()

What’s the big deal with `login.js`, you ask? Well, this JavaScript file revealed that the application was encrypting passwords client-side using the **CryptoJS library** and then sending them to the server.

![]()

Upon analyzing the JavaScript code, I determined that the **application was using the AES algorithm in CBC Cipher mode, with a hardcoded secret key and initialization vector (IV).** Here is a formatted version of the same JavaScript code snippet:

```
$("#login").click(function() {
    var e = $("#username").val(),
        n = $("#password").val();
    if (0 == e.length) return void $(".error").html(language_class.login.error.username);
    if (0 == n.length) return void $(".error").html(language_class.login.error.password);
    var o = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("1111111111111111"),
        t = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("2222222222222222"),
        l = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(n),
        i = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(l, o, {
            iv: t,
            mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
        });
    n = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(i.ciphertext.toString()
        .toUpperCase()));
```

To further investigate, I quickly created a decryption code and successfully decrypted the previously copied password. Here is the decryption code I used:

```
console.log(CryptoJS.AES.decrypt("vUZ6I78zsJ/3X8a/60GTvg==",
  CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("1111111111111111"), {
      iv: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("2222222222222222"),
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
      padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  }).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
```

The decrypted password that I obtained was: **electrasystems1**

![]()

But would this password actually get me inside the application? To validate the severity of this vulnerability, I attempted to log into the application using the username and cleartext password.

![]()

Surprise! **I successfully gained unauthorized access to the router.**

My guess was right, I concluded from the model number that it is an **Industrial Cellular Router**.

![]()

UR75 V1, a first-generation Industrial Cellular Router model

Along with this, I also did port scanning using `nmap` and found 4 open ports including TCP port 22.

![]()

With the help of the same credentials, **I managed to log in to the router console using SSH**.

![]()

To find the owner of the router or the linked organization, I used [bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/) to get the information associated with the IP address. Through this process, I determined that the IP address is linked with Telus Communications Inc., a Canadian telecom company.

After a little analysis and gathering information from the internet, I concluded that the IP address is assigned by Telus to the SIM card inside the cellular router. Therefore, it is quite difficult to get SIM-owner/router-owner information to inform/notify about this issue.

![]()
# But I wasn’t done yet!

I wanted to see if other routers were also vulnerable. I queried again with the new Google Dorks `"/lang/log/system" ext:log`, `"URSALINK" "English" "Login"` and confirmed that a bunch of routers were also vulnerable.

![]()

**Google Dork**`: "/lang/log/system" ext:log`

![]()

**Google Dork**`: "URSALINK" "English" "Login"`

I was not satisfied with the limited results, so I used the [Shodan Search Engine](https://www.shodan.io/) to get more such routers using the `http.html:rt_title` search query filter.

![]()

It returned over 5500 results! 🎣 I downloaded all the Shodan results, filtered and exported them into a text file.

**Command**: `shodan parse --fields ip_str,port --separator ":" shodan_results.json.gz > ursalink_ip.txt`

Using `httpx`, exported URLs of all vulnerable router web interfaces by requesting the `/lang/log/httpd.log` endpoint.

**Command**: `httpx -l ursalink_ip.txt -x HEAD -path "/lang/log/httpd.log" -sc -title -location -cl -ct -csv -o ursalink_vulnerable_hosts.csv`

To demonstrate the impact, and verify the vulnerability at scale, I created a Python script to test all of those results, and you can find it in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/win3zz/CVE-2023-43261).

The script allows the testing of a router’s console URL or a list of URLs from a text file and quickly retrieves the admin password. Passed the result of the vulnerable list of URLs to my script and observed cleartext admin credentials.

![]()

As a result — most routers were vulnerable, and I collected administrator credentials. I even logged in to a few devices as proof. I identified that the Ursalink Industrial Cellular Router series UR5X, UR32L, UR32, UR35, and UR41 were vulnerable and others may also be vulnerable.

This vulnerability becomes even more severe as **some routers allow the sending and receiving of SMS messages.** An attacker could exploit this functionality for fraudulent activities, potentially causing financial harm to the router owner.

![]()

After logging in, go to **General Settings** in the **System** menu, and access the **SMS** tab for messaging.

![]()

SMS received from a Malaysian number

I started investigating the router manufacturer Ursalink. I learned that previously the manufacturer of this device was a Chinese company called Xiamen Ursalink Technology Co., Ltd., but then they merged with Milesight, and now they operate as **Milesight IoT Co., Ltd.**

I reached out to the company through email at iot.support@milesight.com and [Help Desk/Support](https://support.milesight-iot.com/support/home) to report this vulnerability.

In my communication with them, I explained to them why **system logs, such as** `system.log` **and** `httpd.log`**, should not be publicly accessible**. I recommended the implementation of appropriate access controls to limit their exposure.

Additionally, I stressed the need to **avoid the practice of hardcoding keys or IVs** within the application code. While I acknowledged that the encryption layer was intended to provide an extra layer of security on top of TLS, I pointed out that its current implementation might not be as effective as intended. **This encryption could be easily cracked and introduce unnecessary overhead to both the browser and the application, affecting overall performance.** Therefore, I suggested reconsidering the necessity of this layer or exploring alternative, more secure algorithm implementations.

In response to my report, the company thanked me for the detailed report and confirmed that the vulnerability was a known issue. They assured me that the vulnerability had already been resolved/fixed in their latest firmware. They also provided the latest firmware version for verification purposes.

## CHAPTER 2

# The Art of Firmware Emulation

In this chapter, I won’t be able to share the findings or other confidential details, but I’m excited to share some essential steps with you. If you’ve ever found yourself in a similar situation, dealing with firmware and emulation, this may be the insight you need.

So, I received a firmware file named **35.3.0.7.bin**. Using the `file 35.3.0.7.bin` command, I found out that it is a zip archive. Running `binwalk 35.3.0.7.bin`, I found that this file was encrypted/password-protected and it contained two compressed files: router.tar and upgrade\_tool.tar.gz.

1. `router.tar` was the big deal here; it held all the crucial firmware components like the kernel and file system.
2. On the other hand, `upgrade_tool.tar.gz` wasn’t as important. It contained some scripts to extract the firmware data from `router.tar` and perform a system upgrade.

![]()

I decrypted `35.3.0.7.bin` and extracted some important files, namely `filesystem.squashfs`, `ur35.dtb`, and `zImage_signed.bin`, all from the `router.tar`. But then, the question was, “**How do I use these files?**”

One approach considered was using `binwalk -Me filesystem.squashfs` to extract the contents of a Squashfs filesystem for analysis, but since it doesn’t allow program execution within the filesystem, I opted not to proceed with it.

![]()

I didn’t have access to the physical device (which happened to be an Industrial Cellular Router). So, **I decided to attempt emulating the provided firmware on my Debian Linux (Ubuntu) machine using a tool called** [**QEMU**](https://www.qemu.org/) **(Quick Emulator)**, the generic open-source emulator and virtualizer.

Now, emulating router firmware directly on a Linux Debian system isn’t exactly a walk in the park. You see, router firmware is designed for embedded systems with different CPU architectures (like ARM or MIPS) than what a typical Linux Debian system uses (x86 or x86\_64). After reading the router’s specifications, I found out that this particular router used a **32-bit ARM architecture.**

![]()

Emulating one architecture on another can be difficult and requires tools like QEMU, which can be a bit of a hassle to set up.

So, I rolled up my sleeves and installed QEMU for ARM with the command `sudo apt install qemu-system-arm`. You can choose between `qemu-system-arm` or `qemu-system-aarch64` to simulate a 32-bit ARM machine. **QEMU’s ARM system emulation requires you to specify a board model using the** `-M` **or** `-machine` **option.** This is where `ur35.dtb` file comes into play, the file I extracted earlier from the router.

To access the content of the **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** file I require a tool that can interpret and extract information from DTB files. The **Device Tree Compiler (DTC)** is a tool that can convert DTB files to a human-readable **Device Tree Source (DTS)** format. To get it, just run `sudo apt install device-tree-compiler`. Using the DTC tool I converted the DTB file to DTS format with the help of the following command: `dtc -I dtb -O dts -o ur35.dts ur35.dtb`.

![]()![]()

A quick look at `ur35.dts` showed that the model was “**Freescale i.MX6 UltraLite 14x14 EVK Board”**.

![]()

This is what the **i.MX6UltraLite Evaluation Kit (EVK)** board looks like

Next, I needed to select a machine or board model for QEMU. I found it by running `qemu-system-arm -machine help | grep i.MX6`, which led me to choose the “**mcimx6ul-evk**” board.

![]()
# We’re getting closer!

With everything set up, my ultimate goal was to gain access to the root shell and the router’s administration web panel. This would allow me to analyze how it handled user input (debugging) and find potential vulnerabilities.

Putting all the pieces together, I came up with the following command:

`qemu-system-arm -M mcimx6ul-evk -kernel zImage_signed.bin -initrd filesystem.squashfs -append “root=/dev/ram0 init=init” -dtb ur35.dtb -nographic -no-reboot`

**Let’s break down the command step by step:**

1. `qemu-system-arm`: This is the QEMU command to run a virtual machine with an ARM-based processor architecture.
2. `-M mcimx6ul-evk`: This specifies the machine or board model to emulate. In this case, it’s set to emulate the “**mcimx6ul-evk**” board.
3. `-kernel zImage_signed.bin`: This option specifies the kernel image file to be loaded into the virtual machine. “**zImage\_signed.bin**” is the kernel image that will be used.
4. `-initrd filesystem.squashfs`: This option specifies the initial ramdisk (initrd) image file to be loaded into the virtual machine. It contains an initial file system that can be used during the boot process. In this case, it’s “**filesystem.squashfs**”
5. `-append “root=/dev/ram0 init=init”`: This option provides a kernel command line that will be passed to the kernel during boot. It specifies two boot parameters: **1.** `root=/dev/ram0`— This sets the root filesystem to be loaded from RAM (/dev/ram0) initially. **2.** `init=init` — It instructs the kernel to execute the traditional init process as the initial user-space program during boot
6. `-dtb ur35.dtb`: This option specifies the device tree binary (DTB) file to be used. Device tree files describe the hardware configuration to the kernel, and “ur35.dtb” is the one specified here.
7. `-nographic`: This option tells QEMU to operate without a graphical user interface (GUI). It’s useful for text-based or headless operations.
8. `-no-reboot`: This option tells QEMU not to automatically restart the virtual machine if it shuts down. This can be helpful when debugging or testing specific scenarios.

I was able to partially emulate the firmware using this command but was still unable to run the server and access the web admin panel on the host machine. I faced numerous challenges and made countless adjustments to my final command.

Now, I won’t bore you with all the twists and turns, but let me tell you, I tinkered with configurations and parameters in my final command until it was just right. And after a few failed attempts (hey, it was my first time emulating firmware), I cracked the code!

![]()

**A snapshot version of** [**LEDE “Reboot”**](https://openwrt.org/releases/17.01/start) **was running on the system**. LEDE (Linux Embedded Development Environment) merged with the OpenWrt project in early 2018. [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) is an open-source project that provides a Linux-based operating system (OS) and firmware for embedded devices, particularly routers and network devices.

I was more interested in web admin. The web admin interface details can typically be found in a configuration file. I began to inspect the router’s configuration file to find relevant details.

![]()

After a little digging, I found a configuration file for the [**uHTTPd web server**](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/webserver/http.uhttpd), which is commonly used for web admin interfaces on OpenWrt-based systems.

I was looking for the controller file like `file-export` that was handling HTTP requests.

![]()

I found those files in `/www/cgi-bin/`directory.

![]()

Those handler files were symbolic links pointing to `/usr/libexec/luci2-io`

![]()

I extracted the `luci2-io` binary file from the firmware and started analyzing it using [**Ghidra**](https://ghidra-sre.org/)**.**

![]()

After some debugging and analysis, I found several vulnerabilities, but due to company confidentiality, I can’t share them here.

Lastly, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to [**Milesight**](https://www.milesight.com/) for their proper coordination and for providing the firmware.

# CVE-2023-43261 - PoC

### Critical Vulnerability Exposes Sensitive Information and Enables Unauthorized Access in Milesight Routers

* **Date:** 1 October 2023
* **Vendor of the product:** [Milesight](https://www.milesight.com/) (Formerly Xiamen Ursalink Technology Co., Ltd.)
* **Affected Products:** UR5X, UR32L, UR32, UR35, UR41 and there might be other Industrial Cellular Routers that could also be vulnerable.
* **Affected Firmware:** I've confirmed the patch for firmware v35.3.0.7. Earlier versions may be vulnerable, but vendor confirmation is needed. I have made the request, but I have not received a response yet.
* **Severity:** 7.3/10 - [![Alt text](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e911b09648b43497e3bb4288bc716a5b8208d50b44c1cb864fdcc47fab2ed34/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d486967682d646633643033)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e911b09648b43497e3bb4288bc716a5b8208d50b44c1cb864fdcc47fab2ed34/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d486967682d646633643033)

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in Milesight Industrial Cellular Routers, compromising the security of sensitive credentials and permitting unauthorized access. This vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration that results in directory listing being enabled on the router systems, rendering log files publicly accessible. These log files, while containing sensitive information such as admin and other user passwords (encrypted as a security measure), can be exploited by attackers via the router's web interface. The presence of a hardcoded AES secret key and initialization vector (IV) in the JavaScript code further exacerbates the situation, facilitating the decryption of these passwords. This chain of vulnerabilities allows malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the router.

## Usage

Run the script with the following command, replacing `<URL>` with your target URL.

```
foo@bar:~$ python3 CVE-2023-43261.py <URL>
```

Run the script with the following command to process a list of URLs in the file:

```
foo@bar:~$ python3 CVE-2023-43261.py -f list_urls.txt
```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub.

* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
