- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerable SOAP endpoint in Simcenter Amesim allows for DLL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - CWE-94
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject a DLL and execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application process. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerable SOAP endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SOAP endpoint and does not need authentication.
