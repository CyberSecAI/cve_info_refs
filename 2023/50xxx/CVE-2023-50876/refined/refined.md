**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker only needs to have a subscriber role on the WordPress site, which is the lowest level of authenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a low CVSS score of 4.3, and is considered low priority, being unlikely to be exploited.
