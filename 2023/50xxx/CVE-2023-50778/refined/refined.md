**CVE-2023-50778**

*   **Root Cause:** The PaaSLane Estimate Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests for these endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission checks:** Several HTTP endpoints in the plugin lack proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized access.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** Attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoints.
    *   **CSRF:** Attacker tricks a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that triggers a crafted HTTP request to the affected endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a user into making the malicious request.

**Additional Details:**
