#Fig 1. Conventional RackThe Evolution of Cloud

Achieving cloud required a fundamentally new, purpose-built computing architecture.

An architecture born of necessity â the hyperscalers couldnât scale on commodity infrastructure. So they built their own.

Fig 1. Conventional Rack

Until Oxide, cloud architecture remained exclusively in public cloud datacenters, inaccessible to 85% of global IT workloads that run on-premises.

Despite the vast need for on-prem computing, companies face only a handful of commodity options preserved by market capture, not innovation.

With disparate components that the end-user is left to design, integrate, operate â and support.

Little automation and zero elasticity, capping speed and efficiency.

Vendors pointing fingers with no real accountability, even when teams need it most.

Slow time to value and punitive subscription licensing.

Thatâs why we built the Oxide Cloud Computer.

# Oxide Security Advisory 20231215-1: CVE-2023-50913 SSRF in Oxide software

### Table of Contents

A server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue exists in version 4 and
older of the Oxide software. This issue allows authenticated users
with the collaborator role on a project or silo to send HTTP HEAD and
GET requests to arbitrary URLs on the underlay network, the primary
physical rack-internal IPv6 network where services internal to the
system communicate.

This issue allows such users to send arbitrary queries to the metrics
service if the internal underlay network address for the ClickHouse
service is known. The responses to those queries cannot be read, but
such users can still tamper with metrics data and prevent metrics APIs
from working.

This issue also potentially allows users to read from a limited set
of debugging endpoints served by CockroachDB if the internal underlay
network address is known and the endpoint meets certain requirements.
The set of requirements necessary for information disclosure rules out
nearly all HTTP endpoints served by CockroachDB, but Oxide is unable to
rule out all endpoints at this time.

This issue is fixed in version 5 of the Oxide software; we recommend
customers upgrade as soon as possible.

## [Impacted Products](#_impacted_products)

Oxide software releases version 4 and earlier.

## [Impact](#_impact)

An authenticated user with the collaborator role on a project or silo
can trigger HTTP HEAD and GET requests to arbitrary URLs on the underlay
network. This can manifest as a loss of integrity and availability of
metrics data, and can possibly manifest as an information disclosure of
debugging information for the primary database.

Oxide calculates a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.9 (Medium). Vector:
[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1)

## [Action Required](#_action_required)

Update the Oxide software to version 5.

## [Mitigations](#_mitigations)

There are no mitigations available.

## [Technical Background](#_technical_background)

In version 4 and older of the Oxide software, a user with the
collaborator role on a project or silo could create an image with the
`url` source via the `image_create` endpoint, or import blocks from
a URL into a disk via the `disk_import_blocks_from_url` endpoint.
These were used during development prior to the ability to create
an image from a snapshot and to bulk-write disk blocks via the
`disk_bulk_write_import` endpoint. Version 5 of the Oxide software
removes the `url` image source and the `disk_import_blocks_from_url`
endpoint.

When a user creates an image with the `url` source, Nexus (the Oxide
API server) makes an HTTP HEAD request to the user-provided URL to
query the Content-Length of the response to determine the image size.
If the response is successful (not HTTP 4xx or 5xx), and contains a
Content-Length header that is divisible by the block size (any of
512, 2048, or 4096), Nexus considers the URL a valid image source, and
the image is created. A user can then create a disk from the image and
issue reads to it from an instance, which cause Propolis (the hypervisor
userspace) to make HTTP GET requests with the Range header set; if
the response is successful and has the requested Content-Length based
on the Range header, that data is sent to the instance to complete the
read operation.

The above process is similar for the `disk_import_blocks_from_url`
endpoint, except that the Crucible pantry (part of the storage subsystem
that allows modification of disks while no instance is running) makes
the HTTP HEAD request, and that the Crucible pantry immediately
makes HTTP GET requests with the Range header set until all data is
read or an error condition occurs. The same requirements are necessary
for the operation to succeed; if successful, the user can attach the
disk to an instance and issue reads, which do not create additional
HTTP requests to the URL. If the operation was unsuccessful, any
partially-read data is available on the disk.

Because Nexus, Propolis, and the Crucible pantry are on the underlay
network, they can make HTTP requests to any service on that network.
This allows a user to send HTTP HEAD requests to arbitrary URLs on
the underlay network; if the response to a HEAD request is successful
and contains a Content-Length header divisible by the block size, and
responses to GET requests with the Range header have a body with the
requested length divisible by the block size, the response data can be
viewed by the user.

Additionally, Nexus has access to networks outside the system, to allow
users to access it and allow it to communicate with SAML providers. This
allows a user to send HTTP HEAD requests to arbitrary URLs to networks
routable from the system. These requests are performed without DNS
resolution, so a user must specify an IP address. GET requests routed
outside the system via this issue are not possible, as services making
GET requests only run on the underlay network.

HTTP services on the underlay network are described in the following
sections.

### [ClickHouse](#_clickhouse)

ClickHouse is used by the Oxide software to store metrics. It offers a
SQL-like query interface over HTTP, allowing queries to be passed in via
URL query parameters or a POST request body.

The query interface responds to HEAD requests, but with no
Content-Length header, so reading from the query interface is not
possible. HEAD requests to this interface can run arbitrary SQL
queries; thus it is possible for a user with knowledge of the underlay
network address of the HTTP interface to tamper with data stored in
ClickHouse, either by modifying or deleting metric data or by preventing
the storage and querying of metrics altogether.

The rest of the system’s availability is not affected if either
ClickHouse or the metrics system are unavailable.

### [CockroachDB](#_cockroachdb)

CockroachDB is used by the Oxide software to store all data except
metrics and data stored on disks. Its primary interface is a
PostgreSQL-compatible protocol, but by default it starts an HTTP console
on the same IP address. Prior to version 5 of the Oxide software, this
console was accessible via the underlay network.

Most endpoints served by the CockroachDB console respond
406 Method Not Allowed to HEAD requests, or require a valid
session cookie. The endpoints that successfully respond to HEAD
requests provide a very limited subset of database metrics and health
information, assets for the console UI, and debug endpoints that we do
not expect can provide database contents via GET requests alone. For
data to be read from any of these endpoints, the Content-Length must
be divisible by a valid user-selected block size (512, 2048, or 4096),
and the endpoint must support Range requests.

Oxide has evaluated the HTTP endpoints served by CockroachDB and could
not identify any which meet these requirements, and we are not confident
that this issue could successfully be used for information disclosure;
however, we cannot completely rule out the possibility at this time.

### [Oxide-authored HTTP services](#_oxide_authored_http_services)

The Oxide software consists of many HTTP services authored by Oxide.
These services use a common HTTP library named Dropshot. Dropshot does
not automatically handle HTTP HEAD requests, and no endpoints provided
by any Oxide-authored HTTP services handle HEAD requests. There is no
impact to these services.
