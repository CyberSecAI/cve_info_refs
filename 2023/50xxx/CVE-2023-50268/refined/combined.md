The unit allocated for decNumberCompare was accidentally removed by
commit [680baef](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/commit/680baeffeb7983e7570b5e68db07fe47f94db8c7) (PR [#2804](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/pull/2804))

This caused a stack overflow when comparing a nan with a payload of 1000

### @itchyny **[itchyny](/itchyny)** commented [Aug 1, 2023](#issue-1830248997) • edited Loading

The rounding happens on `decNumberReduce` which reduces the number literal to another decNumber with smaller size to fit to the char buffer we prepare. ~~Using `decimal64` from the library, we can avoid reducing.~~ Adopted [@leonid-s-usov](https://github.com/leonid-s-usov)'s patch. This PR fixes [#2685](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues/2685).

Sorry, something went wrong.

maybe we should discard changes to the file completely? I believe the only change is that you've added jv.h to LIBJQ\_INCS but is it required there?
