Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-50777:

**CVE-2023-50777**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PaaSLane Estimate Plugin stores PaaSLane authentication tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller. Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these tokens.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Authentication tokens are stored in plain text in the `config.xml` files.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The tokens are not masked in the job configuration form, making them easily observable.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Attackers with Item/Extended Read permissions or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted authentication tokens.
    *   Exposure of these tokens could allow an attacker to connect to the PaaSLane service using the compromised credentials.
*  **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker could gain access to the Jenkins controller file system and read the `config.xml` files directly.
    *   An attacker with `Item/Extended Read` permissions for a project could view the unmasked tokens through the job configuration interface.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Or, `Item/Extended Read` permissions to a Jenkins project that uses the vulnerable plugin.
    
**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that as of its publication date, no fix is available for this vulnerability.
*   The issue is related to the lack of proper token masking in the UI and unencrypted storage of sensitive data, not necessarily a code execution or privilege escalation issue.
