Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin_video.php` component of SeaCMS. Specifically, the `action` parameter is vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied input (the `action` parameter) and reflects it back in the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter. This code will then be executed in the browser of any user who visits the crafted URL, including administrators.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The injected script can be used to steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, or other data accessible in the user's browser.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** By compromising an administrator's session, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the SeaCMS installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:**  An attacker crafts a URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `action` parameter of `admin_video.php`.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a user (especially an administrator) into clicking the malicious link, potentially through phishing or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the server to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `action` parameter in `admin_video.php` is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL provided in the blog post is: `http://127.0.0.1/seacms/upload/t9ljh/admin_video.php?action=area%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3Ec7dkw`
- This payload inserts a script tag (`<script>alert(1)</script>`) into the HTML page, which will trigger a JavaScript alert box in the user's browser.

**Affected Product and Version**
- SeaCMS version <= 12.8
