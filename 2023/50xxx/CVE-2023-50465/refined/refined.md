Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded SVG files, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code within them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious SVG files can be uploaded and then executed when accessed, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the malicious SVG file.
- **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to phishing pages, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker might be able to access sensitive data displayed on the page or even the user's local storage, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the "Documents" section of a contact.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a victim views the uploaded malicious SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid account on the MonicaHQ platform.
- **File Upload Access:** The attacker must have access to the contact's document upload functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses an SVG file containing JavaScript code within a `<script>` tag.
- The provided SVG code includes the following as a proof-of-concept:
```xml
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    alert("Monicahq XSS Poc");
  </script>
</svg>
```
- This JavaScript code will display an alert box with the message "Monicahq XSS Poc" when the SVG file is rendered, demonstrating the vulnerability.
