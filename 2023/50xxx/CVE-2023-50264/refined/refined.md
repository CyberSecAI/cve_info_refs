Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/system/backup/download/` endpoint of the Bazarr application. The application fails to validate user-supplied input for the `filename` parameter, which is then directly used in a file path construction. This lack of validation allows for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not sanitize the `filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended backup directory.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The `send_file` function uses the attacker-controlled path, leading to the ability to read any file on the server's filesystem that the Bazarr process has access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server where Bazarr is running, potentially including sensitive configuration files, application code, or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/system/backup/download/` endpoint with a malicious `filename` parameter containing path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Bazarr server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified using a CodeQL query for "Uncontrolled data used in path expression."
- The provided patch commit addresses the issue by normalizing the path, verifying the path is within the intended directory, and returning a 404 if it's not.
- The vulnerability was present in version v1.2.4 and fixed in commit `17add7f`.
