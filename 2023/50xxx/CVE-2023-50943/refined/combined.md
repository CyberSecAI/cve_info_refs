Subject: CVE-2023-50943: Apache Airflow: Potential pickle deserialization
 vulnerability in XComs

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.8.1

Description:

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.1, have a vulnerability that allows a potential attacker to poison the XCom data by bypassing the protection of "enable_xcom_pickling=False" configuration setting resulting in poisoned data after XCom deserialization. This vulnerability is considered low since it requires a DAG author to exploit it. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.1 or later, which fixes this issue.
