Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way .ZED containers are created. The original creation path of the container is stored within the container itself and can be extracted through analysis of the container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the original creation path of the .ZED container. This path can reveal sensitive information about the context in which the container was created, potentially including project names or other relevant details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Limited Confidentiality Breach:** The impact is primarily a low-level confidentiality breach. An attacker could gain information about the usage context of the .ZED container, but no direct access to the encrypted data is achieved through this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Analyzing .ZED containers:** The attack vector is through the analysis of a .ZED container. The attacker would need access to a .ZED container in order to perform the analysis, which could be obtained by various means.
-   **Network:** The attack vector is classified as network-based, indicating that the attacker can perform this analysis remotely once they have a .ZED container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Access to a .ZED container:** The attacker needs to gain access to a .ZED container.
-   **Ability to analyze a .ZED container:** The attacker requires some technical knowledge of how to perform the necessary analysis.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3
- The vulnerability is present in ZED! Enterprise for Windows, ZED! features in ZONECENTRAL for Windows, and ZED! features in ZEDMAIL for Windows in versions prior to 2023.5 (including Q.2020.1, Q.2020.2, Q.2021.1)
- The issue is addressed in version Q.2020.3, Q.2021.2 and 2023.5 or later
