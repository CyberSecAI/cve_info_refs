Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GROWI application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability exists in the App Settings (/admin/app) page, the Markdown Settings (/admin/markdown) page, and the Customize (/admin/customize) page. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into these pages and stored there. When other users visit these pages, the stored scripts will execute in their browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
- **Potential for Cookie Theft/Manipulation:**  The injected scripts can potentially steal cookies or perform other unauthorized actions in the context of the user's session.
- **Fake Page Display:** The attacker could manipulate the content of the page to display fake or misleading information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network by injecting malicious scripts into the affected settings pages of the GROWI application.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected payload is persistently stored within the application itself (in the application settings), meaning it does not require an ongoing connection with the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileged User Access:** An attacker would need to have at least low-level access to the GROWI application and be able to modify the settings in the App Settings, Markdown Settings, or Customize pages.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the vulnerable pages to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in GROWI versions prior to v6.0.0.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
