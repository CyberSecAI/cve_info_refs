# Deepin Reader RCE vulnerability due to a design flaw

High

[BLumia](/BLumia)
published
GHSA-q9jr-726g-9495
Dec 22, 2023

## Package

deepin-reader

## Affected versions

< 6.0.7

## Patched versions

6.0.7

## Description

### Summary

Deepin Linux's default document reader "deepin-reader" software suffers from a serious vulnerability due to a design flaw that leads to Remote Command Execution via crafted docx document.

### Details

Deepin-reader is the default document reader for the Operating System Deepin Linux. The deepin-reader performs some shell command operations while dealing with docx document format.

1. When opening a docx document , deepin-reader creates a temporary directory under /tmp and place the docx document under the directory
2. Then deepin-reader calls the "unzip" shell command to extract the docx file
3. After the extraction process, deepin-reader calls "pandoc" command to convert the docx file to an html file named "temp.html" under word/ directory (created when the docx file is extracted with unzip).

   The command will look something like this, "pandoc temp.docx -o word/temp.html
4. Then deepin-reader will try to convert that html file to pdf and opens the pdf.

This is what happens when we open a docx file in Deepin Linux OS.

This behavior can be exploited by placing a symlink named word/temp.html inside a crafted malicious docx pointing to any file inside the target system.

So, while opening the docx file, pandoc will write to the system file that the symlink word/temp.html is pointing to..

This is a File overwrite vulnerability.

A Remote Code Execution can be achieved by overwriting files like .bash\_rc, .bash\_login etc. Rce will be triggered when the user opens the terminal.

### PoC

The below code is a PoC exploit for the issue.

```
#!/bin/bash

### Impact

This is a File overwrite vulnerability.

A Remote Code Execution can be achieved by overwriting files like .bash\_rc, .bash\_login, etc. Rce will be triggered when the user opens the terminal.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
