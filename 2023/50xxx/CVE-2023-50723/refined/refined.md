{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2023-50723",
    "description": "Multiple instances of missing escaping in the code responsible for displaying sections in the administration interface of XWiki allow any user with edit rights on any page to achieve remote code execution and gain programming rights.",
    "affected_versions": ">= 2.3, < 14.10.15, >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.2, >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.7-rc-1",
    "fixed_versions": ["14.10.15", "15.5.2", "15.7-rc-1"],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-provided input within the 'Heading' field of the `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` object, where the input is not correctly escaped. This allows for the injection of malicious code, leading to remote code execution.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation leading to code injection.",
      "Missing or insufficient output escaping in the heading display.",
      "Execution of user-controlled code with elevated privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing an attacker to gain full control over the XWiki installation, leading to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By creating or modifying a `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` object with a malicious heading via the object editor on any page they have edit rights to.",
       "By creating a document with a specially crafted name that triggers code execution when its configuration is displayed in the administration interface."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have edit rights on any page within the XWiki instance, which is commonly granted to all users for their user profiles by default. No other specific capabilities or user interactions are required.",
   "workarounds": "Manual patches can be applied by editing two pages in the wiki: XWiki.ConfigurableClassMacros and XWiki.ConfigurableClass. The patch involves changing the syntax to xwiki/2.1, and adding proper escaping and access control checks."
