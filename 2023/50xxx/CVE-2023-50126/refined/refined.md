{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The HozardÂ® alarm system uses MIFARE Classic 1K RFID tags for identification, rather than identification and authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The alarm system uses easily cloneable RFID tags. The tags lack proper authentication mechanisms, relying solely on a unique identifier (UID).",
      "The system does not implement sufficient security measures to prevent cloning of the tags."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can clone the RFID tags and use the cloned tags to disarm the alarm system, gaining unauthorized access to the protected area.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker clones the RFID tag by scanning it with an RFID reader.",
       "The attacker emulates the UID of the cloned tag to disarm the alarm system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires access to a legitimate RFID tag and an RFID reader/emulator (such as a Flipper Zero)."
