Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in the research of fingerprint sensors for Windows Hello, which can be used to bypass authentication.

**Vulnerabilities and Root Causes:**

1.  **Dell Inspiron 15 - Linux Enrollment Bypass:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Goodix fingerprint sensor on Dell Inspiron uses separate databases for Windows and Linux enrollments. The Linux driver does not implement SDCP, allowing enrollment with arbitrary IDs. The sensor uses an unauthenticated configuration packet to switch between databases.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   Lack of SDCP enforcement in the Linux driver.
        *   Unauthenticated configuration packet to switch between fingerprint databases.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypass Windows Hello fingerprint authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Boot into Linux.
        2.  Enumerate valid Windows user IDs.
        3.  Enroll an attacker's fingerprint using a valid ID in the Linux database.
        4.  MitM the USB connection between the host and sensor during Windows boot.
        5.  Rewrite the configuration packet to point to the Linux database.
        6.  Login as the legitimate user with the attacker's fingerprint.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**
        *   Ability to boot into Linux.
        *   Ability to MitM USB connection between sensor and host.

2.  **Lenovo ThinkPad T14s - Custom TLS Stack Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Synaptics fingerprint sensor does not enable SDCP, relying on a custom, vulnerable TLS implementation for securing USB communication. The client certificate and key are encrypted with a key derived from machine's product name and serial number, accessible via BIOS or sticker.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   Custom TLS implementation with vulnerabilities.
        *   Encryption key derived from publicly available information.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass Windows Hello fingerprint authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Read encrypted client certificate/key.
        2.  Decrypt the blob using product name and serial number.
        3.  Establish a TLS session with the sensor.
        4.  Enumerate valid Windows fingerprint template IDs.
        5.  Enroll attacker's fingerprint spoofing a valid ID.
        6.  Boot into Windows.
        7.  Login as the target user with the attackerâ€™s fingerprint.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**
        *   Ability to read the encrypted client certificate/key.
        *   Knowledge of the target machine's product name and serial number.

3.  **Microsoft Surface Pro X/8 Type Cover - Lack of Authentication:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The ELAN fingerprint sensor lacks SDCP and uses cleartext USB communication with no authentication.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   No authentication of the sensor by the host.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of Windows Hello fingerprint authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1. Unplug the legitimate Type Cover.
        2. Plug in an attack device that advertises the sensor's VID/PID.
        3. Observe valid SID from Windows driver.
        4. Pass the "how many fingerprints" check.
        5. Initiate Fingerprint Login.
        6. Send a valid login response from the spoofed device.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**
        *   Ability to spoof a USB device with the correct VID/PID.
        *   Knowledge of a valid user SID on the system.

**Additional Points:**

*   **Match-on-Chip (MoC) Misconception:** While MoC sensors prevent replay of stored fingerprint data, they do not inherently prevent malicious sensors from spoofing communication or replaying traffic.
*   **SDCP's Limited Scope:** SDCP only secures a limited portion of device operations, leaving a large attack surface. Additionally, SDCP wasn't even enabled in the Lenovo and Microsoft devices tested.
*   **USB MitM Challenges:** Existing USB MitM tools have limitations, particularly with high-speed devices and zero-length packets (ZLPs), requiring the development of custom solutions.
*   **Infoleak by Design**: Enumerating enrolled fingerprints is a built-in feature of the protocol.
*   **Poor Firmware Quality**: The quality of sensor firmwares seems poor and susceptible to other vulnerabilities.
