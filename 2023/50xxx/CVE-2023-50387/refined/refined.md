**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

   - **Root cause of vulnerability:**
      - The root cause is a flaw in the design of DNSSEC that does not limit the amount of work done while validating DNSSEC responses.
      - Specifically, the vulnerability is rooted in the combination of:
         - The allowance of multiple DNSKEYs with the same key tag.
         - The requirement to try all of them for validation purposes.
         - The validation of multiple signatures for one record set (RRSet).
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
      - **Excessive CPU Consumption:** DNSSEC validators exhaust CPU resources due to the combinational explosion of DNSKEYs and RRSIG records during validation.
      - **Algorithmic Complexity Attack:** The vulnerability allows attackers to force DNS resolvers to perform a high number of cryptographic operations and hash calculations, leading to a denial of service.
      - **Vulnerable Standards:** The vulnerability is inherent in the DNSSEC standard, as per RFC 2535, RFC 4035, RFC 6781, and RFC 6840.
   - **Impact of exploitation:**
      - Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting the CPU resources of DNS resolvers.
      -  Impaired DNS resolution for end-users, leading to unavailability of various Internet services.
      - Potential disruption of critical systems that rely on DNS, including spam filters, PKI, and RPKI.
   - **Attack vectors:**
      -  Attackers craft a DNS zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, causing the resolver to attempt all combinations for validation (KeyTrap).
      - Attackers can cause excessive CPU load by utilizing multiple NSEC3 records (NSEC3 closest encloser proof).
      - Attackers can send DNS messages with many different names, also leading to excessive CPU load.
      - Attackers can also use a combination of the above in a single DNS response to maximize the CPU usage on the DNS resolver.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
      - Ability to publish a DNS zone and authoritative server for the zone.
      - Ability to create a high number of DNSKEY records and signatures.
      - No specific position is needed; the attack can be carried out from anywhere on the internet.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

   - **KeyTrap:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a single DNS packet, which triggers an exponential amount of processing on the resolver, thereby exhausting its CPU resources.
   - **NSEC3 Exploitation:** The vulnerability involving NSEC3 records allows the attacker to control the amount of hashing operations, thus controlling the CPU load on a vulnerable resolver.
   - **Asymmetric Nature:** The attacks are asymmetrical, requiring little computational effort from the attacker while causing high resource consumption on the resolver.
   - **Impact on Multithreading:** While multi-threaded DNS servers could continue processing some requests, they could still be stalled by the attack when all threads are occupied with validation.
   - **Lack of Limits:** The standards do not specify explicit limits on parameters like number of keys, signatures, or hash iterations which makes implementations susceptible to this attack.
   - **Patches:** Patches involve limiting the amount of DNSSEC validation work, offloading DNSSEC validation to different threads (in BIND), limiting the number of NSEC3 hash iterations, and other similar mitigation measures.
   - **NetApp's mitigation:** NetApp states their fixes will be made available on their support website, and they have listed a number of products that are affected and not affected.
   - **PowerDNS's mitigation:** PowerDNS suggests upgrading to a patched version or disabling DNSSEC validation.
