The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda W30E routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `formUpgradeMeshOnline` function within the httpd binary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling input within the `formUpgradeMeshOnline` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the router to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/module` endpoint with the `upgradeMeshOnline` action.
- The request includes a payload with a long string (0x500 bytes of "e") in the `devices` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically implies being on the same network as the router, or having some form of network access.
- The attacker also requires a valid session ID.
