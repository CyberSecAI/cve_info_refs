# SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries

This repository offers a comprehensive set of libraries designed to simplify the integration of [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html) (SAP BTP) security services (XSUAA and Identity Services).
Tailored to support Jakarta EE and Spring Boot applications running on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes environments.
The libraries focus on streamlining [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net) access token validation for tokens issued by XSUAA and Identity Services. In addition, it offers a token-client library to easily fetch tokens without cumbersome setup for http requests. Finally, it offers testing utility that mocks Xsuaa and Identity service behaviour and makes it easy to write integration and unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the SAP Cloud Security Services Integration libraries, you must fulfil the following requirements:

1. Knowledge of Java programming and (Optional) Spring Boot framework.
2. Access to an SAP BTP account and the XSUAA or Identity service.
3. Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
4. Java 17
5. Maven 3.9.0 or later
6. (Optional) Spring Boot 3.0.0 or later, Spring Security 6.0.0 or later if using the Spring integration

❗ For Java 8 and 11 please use [2.x release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/tree/main-2.x) of this library.

## Usage

Typical web applications consist of a gateway server serving HTML content to the user client and one or more servers behind the gateway providing REST APIs. The gateway server acts as OAuth2 client executing an OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow to retrieve an access token when a new user client session is created. Requests from the user client are correlated with a session id on the gateway server which appends the access token to subsequent requests and forwards them to the REST APIs. The session flow looks as follows:

1. A user accesses the web application using a browser or mobile device which begins a new server session.
2. The web application redirects the user client to the OAuth2 server for authentication. In typical SAP Business Technology Platform scenarios, this is handled by an application router. Upon authentication, the web application receives an authorization code from the user client issued by the OAuth2 server.
3. An access token is retrieved from the OAuth2 server in exchange for the authorization code.
4. The web application uses the access token to access resources on an OAuth2 resource server via a REST API. The OAuth2 resource server validates the token using online or offline validation to restrict access to the API.

[![OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/raw/main/docs/oauth.png)](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/docs/oauth.png)

OAuth2 resource servers (as the one in step 4) require libraries for validating access tokens.

### 2.1. Token Validation

Key features:

* Automatic OAuth2 service configuration based on SAP BTP service bindings found in the environment
* OAuth2 Token Validation based on these service configurations
* Easy access to principal and token claims within request handlers
* Automatic or sample integrations for common web application frameworks (i.e. Jakarta EE / Spring Security)

#### 2.1.1. Jakarta EE web applications

Developers who need OAuth2 token validation and token access in their Jakarta EE applications can utilize the [java-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security) library. This library simplifies the process of acquiring token information such as principal and audiences from the security context and takes over token validation for tokens issued by Xsuaa or Identity services.
This library is also integrated in SAP Java Buildpack.

In the table below you'll find links to detailed information.

| Library | Usage Examples |
| --- | --- |
| [java-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security) | [java-security-xsuaa-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/java-security-usage) demonstrates java-security usage with Xsuaa service  [java-security-identity-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/java-security-usage-ias) demonstrates java-security usage with Identity service  [sap-java-builpack-api-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/sap-java-buildpack-api-usage) demonstrates java-security usage with SAP Java Buildpack |

💡 Changes with SAP Java Buildpack 1.26.0
The former SAP Java Buildpack versions have used deprecated (Spring) Security libraries and had to be updated. As of version 1.26.0 SAP Java Buildpack uses the [`java-security`](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security) library. Please consider these (migration) guides:

* [MANDATORY: clean-up deprecated dependencies](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security/Migration_SAPJavaBuildpackProjects.md)
* [OPTIONAL: Leverage new APIs and features](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security/Migration_SAPJavaBuildpackProjects_V2.md)

#### 2.1.2. Spring Boot web applications

Developers seeking OAuth2 token validation and access to token information for their Spring Boot applications can benefit from the [spring-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-security) library.
This library streamlines the process of handling token validation for tokens issued by Xsuaa or Identity services and obtaining token details, such as principal and audiences from the security context.

❗ For backward compatibility there is [spring-xsuaa](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-xsuaa) library available that supports only Xsuaa service integration, but with the next major release it will be removed.

* If you're already using [spring-xsuaa](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-xsuaa) in your project you should plan the time to migrate to the [spring-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-security), see [migration guide](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-xsuaa/Migration_JavaContainerSecurityProjects.md).
* If you're just setting up your project you should use [spring-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-security) library.

In the table below you'll find links to detailed information.

| Library | Usage Examples |
| --- | --- |
| [spring-security](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-security) | [spring-security-hybrid-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/spring-security-hybrid-usage) demonstrates usage of xsuaa and Identity service token validation |
| [spring-xsuaa](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/spring-xsuaa) | [spring-security-basic-auth](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/spring-security-basic-auth) demonstrates how a user can access Rest API via basic authentication (user/password)  [spring-xsuaa-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/spring-security-xsuaa-usage) demonstrates xsuaa only setup |

### 2.2. Token Flows for token retrievals

Java applications that require access tokens (JWT) from Xsuaa or Identity services can utilize the Token Flows API from the [token-client](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/token-client) library, to fetch JWT tokens for their clients (applications) or users.

Typical use cases:

* technical user / system tokens for service to service communication
* user token exchange for principal propagation in service to service communication

In the table below you'll find links to detailed information.

| Library | Usage Examples |
| --- | --- |
| [token-client](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/token-client) | [java-tokenclient-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/java-tokenclient-usage) demonstrates usage of token client library in Jakarta EE application [spring-security-xsuaa-usage](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/spring-security-xsuaa-usage) demonstrates usage in Spring Boot application |

### 2.3 Testing utilities

For authentication/authorization flow testing purposes there is [java-security-test](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security-test) library at your disposal that can be used for unit and integration tests to test the Xsuaa or Identity service client functionality in the application.
It provides a [JwtGenerator](/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/java-security-test/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/test/JwtGenerator.java) to generate custom JWT tokens that work together with a pre-configured [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/) web server that stubs outgoing calls to the Identity or Xsuaa service, e.g to fetch the JWKS used to check the validity of the token signature.
With this library you can test end to end all your secured endpoints or app logic that is dependant on information from the tokens.

Key features:

* Generates and signs tokens with user provided attributes
* Provides a pre-configured local authorization server that mocks communication with the BTP security services to validate self-generated tokens
* For Jakarta EE application sets up a local application server that is pre-configured with a security filter matching self-generated tokens. It can be configured to serve the servlets you want to test with mocked authorization

In the table below you'll find links to detailed information.

## Common Pitfalls

### java.lang.NoSuchMethodError and java.lang.ClassNotFoundException errors

Most common reason for these errors are out of sync client library versions. All the modules of the Security Client libraries
should be always in the same version.
This can be verified by executing `mvn dependency:tree` command.

The easiest way to manage the module versions and keep them in sync is to use the [BOM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms)

The usage of the Security Client Libraries BOM is demonstrated also in the [spring-security-hybrid-usage sample](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/blob/main/samples/spring-security-hybrid-usage/pom.xml#L35-L45)

### reference-instance plan not supported

The `reference-instance` plan is not an original plan of the Xsuaa service, therefore it is not supported by the Security Client Libraries out of the box.
For a workaround please refer to the [#1279 (comment)](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library/issues/1279#issuecomment-1735542987)

## How to get support

**Support is no longer provided via the Issues feature in this Github repository.**

Please use SAP official support channels to get support under component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-LIB` or `Security Client Libraries`.

Before opening support tickets, please check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and [Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls) sections first in addition to the READMEs of the modules that you are using from this repository.

Make sure to include the following mandatory information to get a response:

* List of module(s) of this library used by your application (java-security, spring-security, spring-xsuaa etc...) and version of this library installed in your application.

  *Alternative*: maven dependency tree
* Auth service set-up of your application (XSUAA, IAS, XSUAA+IAS, IAS+AMS, etc.)
* For exceptions: Stack trace that includes the executed code locations of this library that lead to the exception
* For unexpected 401 / 403 response codes: relevant log output of this library with active DEBUG flag (see module READMEs for a guide how to enable it)
* Steps you have tried to fix the problem
* Reason why you believe a bug in this library is causing your problem

Unfortunately, we can *NOT* offer consulting via support channels.

In our ongoing commitment to maintaining a robust and secure SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) environment, we want to bring your attention to an important security note that has recently been released. While we understand the significance of transparency, we'll refrain from explicitly detailing the nature of the issue to prevent any potential exploitation. Instead, we encourage all BTP users to carefully review this security note and take necessary actions promptly.

[**Security Note 3411067**](https://me.sap.com/notes/3411067)

This security note addresses a critical privilege escalation issue within SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries. The note outlines the symptoms, prerequisites, and reasons behind the identified concern, providing a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks involved.

**Action Steps:** To safeguard your SAP BTP environment, we strongly urge all users to:

1. **Check the Security Note:** Navigate to SAP's official support portal and review Security Note 3411067 for detailed information.

1. **Validate Prerequisites:** Ensure your system aligns with the noted prerequisites to accurately assess the relevance of this security update to your setup.

1. **Implement the Solution:** Follow the provided solution outlined in the security note to address the identified issue and fortify your system against potential threats.

SAP takes all matters relating to your security very seriously, and we are constantly working on improving our product security measures.

[Report a Security Issue](https://me.sap.com/createIssue/0/overview "Report a Vulnerability")

## SAP Security Patch Day

The security maintenance of installed SAP software is key to continuously protect also against new types of attacks or newly identified potential weaknesses.

Based on feedback from customers, partners and SAP user groups, SAP has launched a regular **SAP Security Patch Day**, scheduled for the **second Tuesday of every month** — which has been synchronized with the Security Patch Day of other major software vendors.

On these SAP Patch Days, SAP publishes software corrections as **SAP Security Notes**, focused solely on security to protect against potential weaknesses or attacks. Access [SAP Security Notes in SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/app/securitynotes), then select *All Security Notes*, to get the complete list of all SAP Security Notes. **We recommend that you implement these corrections at a priority**. Several tools are available to help identify, select and implement these corrections.

SAP categorizes SAP Security Notes as *Patch Day Security Not*es and *Support Package Security Notes*, with the sole purpose of making you focus on important fixes on patch days and the rest to be implemented automatically during SP upgrades. For details refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html). Security fixes for SAP NetWeaver based products are also delivered with the support packages.

Starting June 11, 2019, for all new SAP Security Notes with high or very high severity we deliver fix for Support Packages shipped within the last 24 months\* for the versions under Mainstream Maintenance and Extended Maintenance. This is extended from the previous Support Package coverage of 18 months.

Notes with low or medium priority contain corrections in at least the newest support package in all mainstream and extended maintenance releases.

\*For information on areas with an exception from the 24 months maintenance strategy, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html?anchorId=section_237298869 "exceptions").
