```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the `/common/down/file` route, where the `fileKey` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability: By crafting the `fileKey` parameter with malicious file paths (e.g., `/../../../../../../../etc/passwd`), attackers can bypass access controls and access files outside of the intended directory."
    , "Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with a malicious `fileKey` parameter in the `/common/down/file` route.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific position or privileges on the target system are required."
