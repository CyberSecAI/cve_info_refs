- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unprivileged user can perform actions that are intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies case by case but could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or other security breaches depending on the specific function affected by the missing checks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a function within the WordPress plugin that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber of the WordPress website, which is considered a low-privileged user role.
