Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50128:

**Verification:** The provided content directly discusses CVE-2023-50128, relating to a replayable remote control signal vulnerability in the Hozard® Alarmsysteem.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the absence of a rolling code mechanism in the remote control of the Hozard® Alarmsysteem. This allows the same signal to be replayed to achieve the same effect of disarming the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of rolling code implementation: The remote control transmits a static signal each time it is used.
- No authentication: The system accepts the signal without any authentication check besides the signal itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can record a single disarm signal and replay it at will to disarm the alarm system, gaining unauthorized access to the protected perimeter.
- This allows an attacker to bypass the alarm system's intended security function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Wireless signal interception: An attacker needs to intercept the radio signal transmitted by the remote control when disarming the system.
- Signal replay: The attacker replays the captured signal, which the alarm system accepts as valid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept radio signals: The attacker needs equipment capable of intercepting radio signals (e.g., Flipper Zero).
- Proximity: The attacker needs to be within the range of the remote control and alarm system to intercept and replay the signal.
- No technical skills required: The article mentions that the Flipper Zero makes it easy to replay the signal without extensive technical knowledge.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Secura while evaluating the security of smart home devices.
- The Flipper Zero tool was used to capture and replay the signal
- The vendor did not respond to communications attempting to disclose this vulnerability
