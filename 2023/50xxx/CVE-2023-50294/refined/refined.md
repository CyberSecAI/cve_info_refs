Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Cleartext storage of sensitive information: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the "Secret access key" within the App Settings (/admin/app) page is stored in cleartext, meaning it's not encrypted or properly protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-312:** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information - The application fails to encrypt or hash the secret access key before storing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who gains access to the App Settings page can obtain the Secret access key for external services. This access could lead to unauthorized information access or misuse of external resources associated with the key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network access: An attacker needs to have network access to the GROWI application.
*   Administrative access: An attacker must have administrative privileges to access the App Settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires valid credentials with high privileges to access the admin panel.
*   No user interaction is required for exploitation after the attacker has access to the admin page.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-50294 is a vulnerability where the "Secret access key" is stored in clear text, making it accessible to an attacker who has already gained administrative access to the App Settings page, leading to the possibility of unauthorized access to external services associated with the key.
