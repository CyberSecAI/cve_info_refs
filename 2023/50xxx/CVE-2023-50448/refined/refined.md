The provided content relates to CVE-2023-50448.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A concurrency issue in ActiveAdmin versions prior to 2.12.0 where a variable holding the collection to be exported as CSV was shared across threads without proper synchronization. This allowed an attacker to potentially access private data of another user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Thread unsafety due to shared state of the collection variable used for CSV export.
- Lack of proper synchronization mechanisms for concurrent requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to private data belonging to another user.
- Potential data leak through the CSV export functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network.
- Attacker and victim must use the same ActiveAdmin application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs access to the same ActiveAdmin application as the victim.
- Ability to make a CSV export request.
- Ability to time the attack to coincide with a victim's CSV export request, or make frequent requests hoping to overlap with other users.
- High privileges within the ActiveAdmin application.
- User interaction is required since the user has to initiate the export.
