Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50862:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2023-50862 and provides specific vulnerability details about it, confirming that it is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation for the `hotelIDHidden` parameter in the `booking.php` resource. The application directly uses this parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific vulnerability is an SQL injection (SQLi). The application is vulnerable to this attack because it doesn't sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this SQL injection to:
*   Gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
*   Potentially gain control of the server if database user permissions allow it.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `hotelIDHidden` parameter in the `booking.php` resource. An attacker can manipulate this parameter through a crafted HTTP POST request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker can be remote since it is an HTTP based attack.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `booking.php` file, specifically in the code snippet related to processing the `hotelIDHidden` parameter.
*   The vulnerable SQL query is:  `SELECT * FROM \`hotels\` WHERE hotelID='$hotelID'`.

This information provides more detail than a standard CVE description, which would typically only provide a high-level summary of the vulnerability. The document gives precise code examples and attack vectors, making it easier to understand the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2023-50862 details an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability due to a lack of input validation on the `hotelIDHidden` parameter within the `booking.php` resource of the Travel Website v1.0 application, leading to potential data breaches and system compromise.
