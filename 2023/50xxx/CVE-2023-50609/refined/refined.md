- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `templatedefine` parameter in `/ajax.aspx`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject a crafted script through the `templatedefine` parameter in the URL to `/ajax.aspx`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that is then visited by a victim user. No authentication is needed for exploitation.
