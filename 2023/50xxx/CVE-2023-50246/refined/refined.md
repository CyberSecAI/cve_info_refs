Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-50246:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `decToString` function within `decNumber.c`. This occurs during the conversion of a decimal number to a string representation. The `decNumberToString` function allocates a buffer that is too small, missing space for the null terminator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow (CWE-122):** The allocated buffer in `decNumberToString` is calculated as `digits + 14` bytes, where "digits" is the number of digits in the number. However, an additional byte is needed for the null terminator when converting it to a C-style string, leading to a write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions on the heap, leading to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The AddressSanitizer output confirms the heap-buffer-overflow and a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specific numeric input. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows an example of a number "-10E-1000010001" triggering the overflow. This number, when converted to a string, results in "-1.0E-1000010000" with the null byte written out-of-bounds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input to `jq`:** An attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted numeric input to the `jq` program. This could be through command-line arguments, files, or other means of input to the program.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix was implemented by allocating `digits + 15` bytes instead, to include the necessary space for null terminator.
- The vulnerability was originally reported by SEU-SSL.
- The vulnerability exists in `jq` version 1.7 and was fixed in version 1.7.1.
