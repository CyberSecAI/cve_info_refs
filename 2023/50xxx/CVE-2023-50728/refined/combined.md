## Description

### Impact

Versions [v9.26.0](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js/releases/tag/v9.26.0), [v10.9.x](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js/releases/tag/v10.9.1)), [v11.1.x](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js/releases/tag/v11.1.1), [v12.0.x](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js/releases/tag/v12.0.3) all contained the code that would throw the error.

Specifically, during a pentest we encountered a bug in the octokit/webhooks library (a dependency of Probot, a framework for building Github Apps). The resulting request was found to cause an uncaught exception that ends the nodejs process.

The problem is caused by an issue with error handling in the @octokit/webhooks library because the error can be undefined in some cases.

Credit goes to [@pb82](https://github.com/pb82) (for the early analysis) and [@rh-tguittet](https://github.com/rh-tguittet) (for discovery).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
