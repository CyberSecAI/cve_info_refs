  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The HozardÂ® alarm system allows an attacker to disarm the system via SMS using a default engineer password, or by guessing the user password via multiple attempts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The system does not force a password change upon initial setup.",
      "The default engineer password is hardcoded and can be used to retrieve system information and disarm the system.",
       "The settings to alter the engineer password are not easily discoverable for a regular user.",
      "The system allows multiple attempts to guess the user password via SMS without locking out the sender."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can remotely disarm the alarm system, allowing unauthorized access to the protected perimeter without triggering the alarm.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Sending SMS messages to the alarm system's phone number."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must know the phone number of the alarm system, which can be obtained through various means such as: retrieving the number from a sent SMS message on the victim's mobile phone, or by intercepting SMS traffic."
