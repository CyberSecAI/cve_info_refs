- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Anti Hacker plugin versions 4.34 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions that the attacker can force the user to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page that performs unauthorized actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that targets a vulnerable function in the plugin and trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into executing it. The attacker does not need to authenticate to execute the attack.
