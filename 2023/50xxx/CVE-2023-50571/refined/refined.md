Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the MVEL expression language within the `easy-rules-mvel` library. MVEL allows the dynamic evaluation of expressions, including the instantiation and execution of arbitrary Java classes if they are available in the classpath. This feature is exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted Class Loading:** The MVEL engine, as used in `easy-rules-mvel`, does not restrict which classes can be loaded and instantiated. This allows an attacker to provide an expression that instantiates a malicious class present in the application's classpath.
*   **Dynamic Code Execution:**  The `when` and `then` methods of the `MVELRule` class accept MVEL expressions, which can be crafted to execute arbitrary Java code.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:**  The `MVELRule.then` and `MVELRule.when` methods do not validate or sanitize the provided MVEL expressions. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the expression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting malicious MVEL expressions, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
*   **System Compromise:** The provided example demonstrates the ability to execute system commands (e.g., opening a calculator on Windows). In a real attack, this could be leveraged for more malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MVEL Expressions:**  The attacker exploits the `MVELRule.when` or `MVELRule.then` methods by providing malicious MVEL expressions that load and execute arbitrary classes, including those containing malicious code in static blocks.
*  **Classpath Dependency:** The malicious class must be present in the classpath of the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to `MVERule.then` or `MVERule.when`:**  The attacker must be able to influence the input provided to the vulnerable methods, either directly or indirectly. This could be through user-supplied data or by manipulating other parts of the application that feed into the rule engine.
* **Understanding of MVEL syntax:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft MVEL expressions to instantiate and trigger execution of arbitrary classes.
* **Class presence:** The attacker needs to know which classes are available in the application's classpath, allowing them to use a class for malicious code execution.

**Mitigations (from the provided content):**

*   **Input Validation:** Strictly control and sanitize inputs to `MVERule.then` and `MVERule.when` to prevent injection of malicious code or class instantiations.
*   **Restrict Class Loading:** The provided code example shows how to use a custom `ClassLoader` to disable class loading within the MVEL parser context. This can prevent the execution of arbitrary code by preventing the loading of custom classes.
*   **Downgrade to a safe version:** Downgrading to version 4.0.0 of `easy-rules-mvel` is suggested as a workaround, but this may not be feasible if other features are needed.
*  **Migrate to another rule engine:** The maintainers of `easy-rules` have stated that the project is in maintenance mode, and migration to an actively developed rule engine is recommended.
