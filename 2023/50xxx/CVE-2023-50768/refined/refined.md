The provided content is a Jenkins Security Advisory that details multiple vulnerabilities, including **CVE-2023-50768**.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-50768**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Nexus Platform Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation, and these methods do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing permission check: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit this.
    *   CSRF: Lack of POST request requirement.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credential IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable form validation methods.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to know the ID of the credentials to be used for capturing.
    *   The attacker needs to host an HTTP server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions that Nexus Platform Plugin is not currently distributed by the Jenkins Project due to licensing issues.
*   The advisory also covers other vulnerabilities, which are not related to CVE-2023-50768.
