- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Blockslidingcart::renderModal()` method in the "Sliding cart block" module (blockslidingcart) for PrestaShop has insecure SQL calls that can be exploited via a simple HTTP request, leading to SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `$id_product` parameter before it's used in an SQL query. Specifically, the code directly uses the `$id_product` variable within an SQL query without ensuring that it contains only integer values.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to neutralize special elements used in an SQL command, leading to potential manipulation of the database query by an attacker.
    - Lack of input sanitization of the `$id_product` parameter.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Data breach**: Attackers can obtain sensitive information from the database, potentially including admin access details, customer data, or other confidential information.
    - **Data manipulation**: Attackers could remove data or modify existing data in the PrestaShop database.
    - **Account takeover**: Attackers could potentially gain administrator access by manipulating SQL queries or exposing tokens.
    - **Email hijacking**: Attackers could rewrite SMTP settings to redirect emails, potentially intercepting or manipulating communications.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Network**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    - **HTTP Request**: The exploit uses a front controller call that can be triggered using a simple HTTP request. The module controller's path can be concealed during the exploit, meaning the attack might be difficult to trace using traditional frontend logs.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior authentication.
    - No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

- **Additional details**:
  - The vulnerability is present in all versions of the module up to and including version 2.3.8.
  - The module's author has discontinued support for it, making patching essential.
  - The provided patch replaces a direct usage of `$id_product` with an integer-validated, comma-separated list, preventing SQL injection on this parameter.
  - The advisory recommends upgrading the module, enabling OWASP rules on the web application firewall, and changing the default database prefix.
