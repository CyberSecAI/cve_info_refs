# Reflected XSS in resque-web failed and queues lists

Moderate

[PatrickTulskie](/PatrickTulskie)
published
GHSA-gc3j-vvwf-4rp8
Dec 18, 2023

## Package

bundler

resque
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 2.2.1

## Patched versions

2.2.1

## Description

### Impact

The following paths in resque-web have been found to be vulnerable to reflected XSS:

```
/failed/?class=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
/queues/><img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

```
### Patches

v2.2.1

### Workarounds

No known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to not click on 3rd party or untrusted links to the resque-web interface until you have patched your application.

### References

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-50725

### @madslundholmdk **[madslundholmdk](/madslundholmdk)** commented [Feb 21, 2022](#issue-1146130830)

After a penetration test, there were multiple Reflected XSS vulnerabilities found in the the web interface.

The following paths has been found vulnerable:

* `/failed/?class=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
* `/queues/><img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

I have look through the other views, and found other places where HTML wasn't escaped from the params.

Sorry, something went wrong.
