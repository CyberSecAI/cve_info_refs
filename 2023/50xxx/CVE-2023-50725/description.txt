Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing them on multiple queues, and processing them later. The following paths in resque-web have been found to be vulnerable to reflected XSS: "/failed/?class=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>" and "/queues/><img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>". This issue has been patched in version 2.2.1.
