Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-controlled input in the `/test/<protocol>/<path:url>` endpoint within the `proxy` function of the `bazarr/app/ui.py` file. Specifically, the `protocol` and `url` variables are concatenated and used in a `requests.get()` call without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SSRF. The server makes a request to a URL provided by the attacker, but the response content is not directly returned to the attacker. Instead, the application checks for a `version` key in the JSON response, revealing the success or failure of the request. This makes the SSRF "blind" as the attacker doesn't get the raw response data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Resource Discovery:** An attacker can use the SSRF to probe internal networks for the existence of services and resources that would not otherwise be accessible from the outside.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Although this is a blind SSRF, further exploitation might be possible, depending on the internal services that become accessible.
- **Denial of Service:** By making requests to very large files or to endpoints that don't respond, the server can be caused to slow down or consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `/test/<protocol>/<path:url>` endpoint.
- The attacker crafts a URL containing a chosen protocol (http or https) and a target URL, which can be an internal or external resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs network access to the Bazarr instance to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version v1.2.4 and fixed in a later commit (17add7f) included in v1.3.1.
- The fix implemented limits the protocols to `http` and `https`.
- The provided commit message indicates that the issue is a blind SSRF and arbitrary file read which implies that the arbitrary file read was fixed in the same commit.
