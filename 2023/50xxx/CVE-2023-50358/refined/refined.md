    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `quick.cgi` component of QNAP QTS firmware. Specifically, the `SPECIFIC_SERVER` parameter, when set in an HTTP request with `todo=set_timeinfo`, is written to `/tmp/quick/quick_tmp.conf` and later used unsanitized in a command executed with `system()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "OS Command Injection",
        "Unvalidated input",
        "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection')",
           "Inadequate authentication"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands on vulnerable QNAP devices.",
      "Attack vector": "The attack vector is remote via HTTP requests, specifically by setting the 'todo' parameter to 'set_timeinfo' and injecting malicious code through the 'SPECIFIC_SERVER' parameter.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to a vulnerable QNAP device is able to exploit this vulnerability.",
       "Affected component": "quick.cgi component of QNAP QTS and QuTS hero firmware"
     , "Affected product": [ "QNAP QTS", "QNAP QuTS hero", "QNAP QuTScloud"],
        "Solution": "Update to the latest version of QTS or QuTScloud hero (e.g., QTS 5.1.5 or QuTS hero h5.1.5), or mitigate by testing the quick.cgi URL and updating to a partially fixed firmware version. QNAP has provided specific build numbers for fixes and mitigations for different firmware branches."
