Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Zammad application's public endpoint `/api/v1/signshow`, which is intended for the login screen. This endpoint improperly exposes internal configuration data related to user object attributes.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is **Information Disclosure**. The `/api/v1/signshow` endpoint leaks sensitive internal configuration data, such as selectable values for user object attributes. This data should not be publicly accessible.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to internal configuration details by querying the publicly available endpoint. This leaked information could be used to gather insights about system configurations, internal structures, and potentially enable further attacks based on the revealed information.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a publicly accessible API endpoint: `/api/v1/signshow`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the Zammad instance to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required since it's designed for the login screen.

The advisory also specifies:
*   **Affected Product:** Zammad 6.1.x
*   **Fixed in:** Zammad 6.2.0
*   **Severity:** Low
