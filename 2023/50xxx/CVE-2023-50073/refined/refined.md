Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `SetEnews.php` file of EmpireCMS v7.5, specifically around line 353. It stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when configuring FTP passwords, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize the 'ftppassword' parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., database name, potentially other user data).
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker modifies the `ftppassword` parameter in the HTTP POST request sent when configuring FTP settings in the administrative panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the administrative panel: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the admin panel of the EmpireCMS to modify the FTP settings.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to know that the 'ftppassword' parameter in the HTTP request is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical details:**
- The provided images show the step-by-step process of exploiting the vulnerability.
-  A specific payload `ftppassword=test'+and+(updatexml(1,concat(0x3a,(database())),1))+and'` is used to demonstrate the SQL injection and extract the database name.
- The vulnerability is found in `e\admin\SetEnews.php` line 353.
- The affected version is EmpireCMS 7.5.
- The vulnerability can be reproduced on a Windows 10 system running PHP 5.4.45 and Apache 2.4.39.
