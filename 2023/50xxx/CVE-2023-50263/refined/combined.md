# Unauthenticated db-file-storage views

Low

[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)
published
GHSA-75mc-3pjc-727q
Dec 12, 2023

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=1.1.0

## Patched versions

1.6.7,2.0.6

## Description

### Impact

In Nautobot 1.x and 2.0.x, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...` and `/files/download/?name=...` are used to provide admin access to files that have been uploaded as part of a run request for a Job that has FileVar inputs. Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and are deleted once the Job in question runs.

It was reported by [@Kircheneer](https://github.com/Kircheneer) that in the default implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances.

Note that no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering this a vulnerability.

### Patches

Fixes will be included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6.

### Workarounds

No workaround other than applying the patches included in <https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4959/files> (2.0.x) or <https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4964/files> (1.6.x)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
