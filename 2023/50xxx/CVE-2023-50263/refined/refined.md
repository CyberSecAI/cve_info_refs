Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-50263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and authorization checks on the `/files/get/?name=...` and `/files/download/?name=...` URLs provided by the `django-db-file-storage` library. These URLs were intended for internal admin access to files uploaded as part of Job run requests with FileVar inputs. However, these URLs did not enforce any user authentication or permissions checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The core issue is the absence of authentication requirements on the file retrieval endpoints. This allows unauthenticated users to attempt to access files if they know the correct file name.
*   **Missing Authorization:** Even if a user is authenticated, there were no permission checks to ensure the user is authorized to view the requested `FileProxy` object.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability relies on the direct use of file names (`name` parameter in the URL) without any validation against permissions associated with the `FileProxy` model instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who knows or can guess file names stored via `FileProxy` can download files without needing to authenticate or possess any specific permissions.
*   **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability is somewhat mitigated by the lack of a file listing/traversal mechanism. Attackers need to know or guess file names to exploit it.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact**: The vulnerability does not allow modification or deletion of files, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker could construct specific URLs with known file names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker requires network access to the Nautobot instance.
*   **File Name Knowledge:** The attacker must know or be able to guess the names of files stored via `FileProxy`. There is no direct mechanism to list or traverse available files, but information disclosure might reveal file names.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have a user account or be authenticated on the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `@Kircheneer`.
*   Patches for this vulnerability were included in Nautobot versions 1.6.7 and 2.0.6.
*   The fix involves enforcing authentication and object-level permissions on the vulnerable file storage views. This was achieved by:
    *   Adding a `@permission_required` decorator to the `get_file_with_authorization` view, ensuring that only users with "view" permissions on the `FileProxy` model can access the view.
    *   Adding an object-level permission check using `FileProxy.objects.restrict(request.user, "view")` and `get_object_or_404` to ensure users can access the specific `FileProxy` object associated with the requested file.

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS v3 score is 3.7 / 10.
*   Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

This reflects the low severity due to the requirement of knowing the file name.

**CWE:**

*   CWE-200: Information Exposure

The provided content describes a vulnerability where unauthenticated users could access files due to a lack of access control on certain URLs. The patches add authentication and authorization checks to mitigate this issue.
