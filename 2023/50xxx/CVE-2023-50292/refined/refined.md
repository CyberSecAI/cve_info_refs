Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-50292:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the Apache Solr Schema Designer feature, which was introduced to simplify schema and configSet configuration. The Schema Designer incorrectly loads configSets without considering their "trust" status (whether they were created by authenticated users).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** The Schema Designer allows loading configSets without proper authorization checks.
*   **Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources:** The Schema Designer loads configsets, including those from unauthenticated users, which can lead to the loading of external libraries.
*   **Lack of Authentication Check:** The "trust" or authentication status of configSets was not checked by the Schema Designer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By loading a malicious configSet created by an unauthenticated user, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the Solr server due to the ability to load external libraries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Users:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability; they can create a malicious configSet and then use the schema designer to load it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create configSets.
*   The attacker needs access to the Solr instance to use the Schema Designer.
*   No authentication is required, making the attack vector accessible to anyone with network access to the Solr instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache Solr versions 8.10.0 through 8.11.2 and 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
*   The fix is implemented in Solr version 9.3.0 and later, which now ensures that external libraries are only loaded from configSets created by authenticated users.
*   The issue is tracked as SOLR-16777.
