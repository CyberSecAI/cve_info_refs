- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation when establishing connections to external services via SSL/TLS. Specifically, the hostname and certificate authority were not properly validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing SSL/TLS certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who can redirect network traffic can potentially intercept or manipulate communications between the Zammad server and external services.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack via network traffic redirection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to redirect network traffic destined for external services used by Zammad.
