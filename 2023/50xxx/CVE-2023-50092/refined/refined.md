Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization in the `requestBeforeLogin` parameter of the apiida API Gateway Manager login page. The application fails to properly encode or remove double quotes (") and allows injecting new HTML attributes into a hidden input field. While it does filter out `<` and `>` characters, this is insufficient to prevent exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application reflects user-supplied input from the `requestBeforeLogin` parameter into the HTML source of the login page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize user input by failing to encode double quotes, allowing attribute injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the hidden input field. While this field is hidden and not directly interactive, using the accesskey attribute with an onclick event, an attacker can execute JavaScript by tricking the user into pressing a specific key combination (ALT+SHIFT+X, in this instance), leading to actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*  **Phishing:** The attacker can inject a message along with the malicious payload, tricking the user into pressing the required key combination.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload embedded in the `requestBeforeLogin` parameter. The user needs to be tricked to click on the malicious URL.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be convinced into pressing the accesskey combination to trigger the exploit. This can be achieved through social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with the XSS payload.
*   **Social engineering skills:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit the malicious link and then execute the injected javascript by using the `accesskey` functionality.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is found in a hidden input field with the name `requestBeforeLogin`.
*   The application removes `<` and `>` characters, which blocks the direct injection of HTML elements; however, it does not encode `"` which allows injection of HTML attributes.
*   The `accesskey` attribute, combined with an `onclick` event, can be used to execute Javascript.
*   The provided CVSS score is 4.3: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
