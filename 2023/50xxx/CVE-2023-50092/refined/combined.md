# CVE-2023-50092 Explained

### Overview

The apiida API Gateway Manager login screen (Tested on v2023.2.2) is vulnerable to a Reflected XSS. The XSS is found in a hidden input field. However injecting the “<” or “>” character with any text after it is removed by the application. This makes it impossible to create a new JavaScript payload. It is however possible to inject new attributes in this hidden input field because of “ not being removed/encoded. This makes it possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the hidden type attribute.

### Setup

The apiida API Gateway Manager software should be downloaded (<https://apiida.com/product/apiida-api-gateway-manager/>) and installed. There is a 30 day free trial available. Setting it up can be done by following the instructions (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0glynREqRcc>). Do not select any different authentication method but keep the standard after setup. As shown in the image below.

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image1.png)
### **Vulnerability steps**

After the setup it should now be possible to visit the login page. If using Docker it can be found by navigating to <https://localhost/>:

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image2.png)

Checking the source code of the login page will show multiple hidden parameters, including one called requestBeforeLogin without a value:

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image3.png)

Navigating to <https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test> will show that test has been added to the requestBeforeLogin parameter:

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image4.png)

Next step is to add a new attribute and trying to break out of the hidden form to receive HTML injection.

**HTML Payload:**

```
[test"%20newAttribute="attribute1"><h1>Text</h1><](https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test%22%20newAttribute=%22attribute1%22%3e%3ch1%3eText%3c/h1%3e%3c)":
```

Navigating to [https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test](https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test%22%20newAttribute=%22attribute1%22%3e%3ch1%3eText%3c/h1%3e%3c)**[“](https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test%22%20newAttribute=%22attribute1%22%3e%3ch1%3eText%3c/h1%3e%3c)**[%20newAttribute=”attribute1″><h1>Text</h1><](https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=test%22%20newAttribute=%22attribute1%22%3e%3ch1%3eText%3c/h1%3e%3c)“ Will show that the newattribute has indeed been added and that “ is not encoded:

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image5.png)

The other attribute such as <h1> and </h1> have been removed however making it only possible to inject JavaScript in the hidden form.

Injecting XSS in hidden input fields can be difficult to exploit because of it being hidden. This means onmouseover, onfocus, onload, etc will not work. There is a way where it can be exploited by using the accesskey attribute (FireFox was used). More information on this can be found here (<https://portswigger.net/research/xss-in-hidden-input-fields>).

In this case you have the trick the user into pressing a certain combination of buttons. In the apiida gateway manager it is possible to also inject a text message after the XSS payload which might trick the user into pressing the buttons.

**XSS Payload:**

```
%22%20accesskey=%22X%22%20onclick=%22alert(%27Succesfull%20XSS%27)%22%3E%20Press%20ALT+SHIFT+X%20to%20see%20something%20cool
```

Navigating to https://localhost/?requestBeforeLogin=%22%20accesskey=%22X%22%20onclick=%22alert(%27Succesfull
%20XSS%27)%22%3E%20Press%20ALT+SHIFT+X%20to%20see%20something%20cool Will have the XSS payload including the phishing message shown in the image below:

![](https://senscybersecurity.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image6.png)

Now when the user presses ALT+SHIFT+X the XSS payload gets executed:

## Step-up your APIOps capabilities

* One-Click Deployment + Migration
  Easy and reliable migration of APIs simplify and speed up deployments between the different environments for development, testing and production. APIIDA’s API Gateway Manager automatically takes care of mapping elements in the different environments to each other and highlights probable causes of errors before even attempting a migration.

  You can create and manage any number of environments with any form-factor. The API Gateway Manager supports virtual appliances as well as containerized gateways. Step up to the next level by using ephemeral gateways, that use customized Docker images instead classic migrations. All with the same workflow and interface.

  Migrations are persisted in the API Gateway Manager’s database and can be used as part of the audit trail. And because we backup all replaced elements before the migration, migrations can be rolled back right from the interface.
* True DevOps flows with Git Integration + Version Control
  Enhanced management and version control of APIs using our built in git integration brings Layer7 on par with other solutions in the market. Automate the deployment of new versions using the Gateway Manager’s REST interface or the command line interface. By leveraging our enhanced, JSON-based format to export APIs from the gateways, we open the door to managing Layer7 policies as code.

  Define dependencies to shared libraries or solution kits within your APIs, to reduce the API policies to what really matters: The policies and business logic.
* CI/CD Pipeline Automation
  Integrate APIIDA’s API Gateway Manager with your CI/CD pipeline tools by leveraging the REST-based API or the command line interface. Our tooling enables you to create pipelines similar to the ones in software development, reacting to changes in code, that continuously integrate changed policies and run automated test-suites.
* Health Check + Security Advisor
  Continuously monitor your API gateway instances and services across multiple clusters in near real-time. Leverage our Advisor module to identify potential issues before they impact the business. These issues include security related ones like unsecured listen ports or expired certificates as well as operational ones as for example resources that differ within the same environment.
* Monitoring + Alarming
  Real-time alerting in the event of a service degradation using your favorite notification channels including, emails, Slack, Teams, Twilio, Mattermost, Webhooks, and others. Make use of your existing Prometheus infrastructure. The API Gateway Manager will retrieve all the metrics from your Layer7 gateways, label them correctly and push them into your Prometheus installation, allowing you to reuse already existing dashboards or alarming settings.
* Modern Dashboard
  Freely customizable dashboard, showing the status of the services and API Gateway instances. Create personalized views, choosing from a library of powerful component widgets.
