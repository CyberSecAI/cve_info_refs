The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2023-50129.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Flient Smart Lock uses MIFARE Classic 1K tags for access control. These tags only use the Unique Identification Number (UID) for identification, without any form of authentication. This allows attackers to easily clone the tags by emulating the UID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication: The system relies solely on the UID of the NFC tag for access control, without any additional authentication mechanisms.
- Use of insecure tags: MIFARE Classic 1K tags are known to be vulnerable to cloning due to their lack of security features.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker can clone an authorized NFC tag and use the clone to unlock the door, gaining unauthorized access to the protected premises.

**Attack vectors:**
- Proximity: The attacker needs to be in proximity to the authorized NFC tag to scan and clone it.
- Cloning device: The attacker needs a device capable of scanning and emulating MIFARE Classic 1K tags (e.g., a Flipper Zero).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical proximity to the authorized tag.
- Possession of a device capable of reading and emulating MIFARE Classic 1K tags, such as the Flipper Zero.
- Basic understanding of how to operate the cloning device.
