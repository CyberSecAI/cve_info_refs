Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2023-50769:

**CVE-2023-50769: Missing permission check in Nexus Platform Plugin leading to credential capture**

*   **Root Cause:** The Nexus Platform Plugin, in versions 3.18.0-03 and earlier, lacks permission checks in its form validation methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Form validation methods lack proper checks, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **CSRF:** The affected form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs (obtained through another method), effectively capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method.
    *   They use the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability to trick a Jenkins user into making the request, thus capturing credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs `Overall/Read` permission in Jenkins.
    *   Attacker needs to know or be able to obtain a valid credential ID from the Jenkins instance.

**Summary of Changes in Fixed Version (Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01):**

*   Requires POST requests for the affected form validation methods.
*   Requires `Overall/Administer` permission for the affected form validation methods.
