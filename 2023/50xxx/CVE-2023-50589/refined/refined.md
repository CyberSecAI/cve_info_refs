Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability described, which is relevant to CVE-2023-50589:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of unsanitized user-supplied input directly in the construction of SQL queries, specifically within the `codLogin` parameter of the login form of GeoSiap ERP. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the `codLogin` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This lack of input validation allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, leading to the execution of unintended database operations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There's no adequate input validation or sanitization to prevent the injection of SQL metacharacters or commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers could gain administrative access to the database if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- **Potential for System Compromise:** The attacker could potentially execute system-level commands under certain conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `codLogin` parameter in the login form at the vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/websis/siapegov/recursos_humanos/grh/grh_rh_online.php`.
- The attacker crafts a malicious string containing SQL code and injects it into the `codLogin` parameter of the login form through a web browser request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is present in an unauthenticated part of the application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required to construct malicious SQL queries.
- SQLMap or a similar tool can be used to automate exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The proof of concept demonstrates how a time-based SQL injection is possible by using `PG_SLEEP` which is a PostgreSQL function. This also identifies the database type (PostgreSQL) which helps crafting the correct SQL injection queries.
- The attacker can extract database names (e.g. 'public') and other database information.
- The report indicates that approximately 25 cities use this vulnerable system, highlighting the wide impact of this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The content recommends the use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries) and sanitizing the input parameters to eliminate unwanted characters as a mitigation.
The use of parameterized queries prevents the user supplied input from being treated as code. Input sanitization prevents special characters that can be used to construct SQL injection payloads from reaching the database.
The OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet is referenced for mitigation guidance.

The content from GitHub is a proof of concept of this vulnerability and is very detailed. The OWASP content provides general guidance on SQL injection, and the OWASP cheat sheet covers SQL injection prevention.
