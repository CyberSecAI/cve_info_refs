Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-50714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) in the `OAuth2` class of the `yii2-authclient` library. Specifically:
   1. The `authCodeVerifier` was not being removed after usage, making it potentially reusable.
   2. There was a risk of a "downgrade attack" if PKCE was relied on for CSRF protection due to the missing removal of the `authCodeVerifier`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Replay Attack:** The `authCodeVerifier` value, which is meant to be used only once, was not being cleared after the access token was fetched. This could allow an attacker to potentially reuse the same `authCodeVerifier` in a replay attack.
*   **PKCE Downgrade Attack:** If an application relies solely on PKCE for CSRF protection, an attacker could potentially exploit the fact that `authCodeVerifier` is not cleared, performing a downgrade attack by attempting to get a new authorization code and using the old code verifier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Compromise:**  By successfully replaying the `authCodeVerifier` an attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.
*   **CSRF bypass**: An attacker may bypass CSRF protection in an application relying on PKCE for it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, where the attacker intercepts or replays the authorization code exchange.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the communication between the client and the authorization server (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack) or be able to cause a user to reuse a previous code verifier.
*   **Understanding of OAuth2 and PKCE:** The attacker needs to have a good understanding of OAuth2 and PKCE to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction as the user needs to initiate the authentication flow and the attacker needs to reuse a code verifier.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in commit `721ed974bc44137437b0cdc8454e137fff8db213` addresses the issue by removing the `authCodeVerifier` from the state after it has been used to fetch the access token.
*   The vulnerability affects versions `<=2.2.14` of the `yiisoft/yii2-authclient` package.
*   The patched version is `2.2.15`.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 6.8
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attack Complexity:** High
*   **Privileges Required:** None
*   **User Interaction:** Required
*   **Scope:** Unchanged
*   **Confidentiality:** High
*   **Integrity:** High
*   **Availability:** None
