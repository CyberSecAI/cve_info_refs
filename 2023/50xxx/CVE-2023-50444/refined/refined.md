Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way metadata is handled within .ZED containers. Specifically, user-sensitive information is included by default in the container's metadata.
- If a user chooses a weak password, this metadata can be compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure default behavior**: Inclusion of sensitive user information in container metadata by default.
- **Brute-force vulnerability**: Susceptibility to brute-force attacks targeting the .ZED container metadata.
- **Reliance on strong user passwords**: Weak passwords can lead to the compromise of the metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Disclosure of sensitive user information**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to uncover user information contained in the .ZED container metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based brute-force attacks**: An attacker can attempt to gain access by repeatedly guessing the password to decrypt the .ZED container's metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access**: The attacker needs to have network access to target the vulnerable system.
- **Ability to perform brute-force attacks**: The attacker must have the ability to run brute-force attacks against the password-protected metadata.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects multiple products, including ZED! Enterprise for Windows, ZED! features in ZONECENTRAL for Windows, and ZED! features in ZEDMAIL for Windows.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS base score of 8.7.
- Patches are available for the affected software versions, which should be applied to remediate the issue.
