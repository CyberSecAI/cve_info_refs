The provided content relates to CVE-2023-50628.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation in the `parser.c` component of libming when parsing SWF files. Specifically, the parser does not verify that the input file is in a valid SWF format, leading to memory leaks when parsing a manipulated or invalid header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leaks occur in `parseSWF_DEFINETEXT`, `readBytes`, `parseSWF_TEXTRECORD`, and `parseSWF_GLYPHENTRY` functions within `parser.c`. These are triggered by an invalid SWF header.
- Insufficient input validation leading to incorrect memory access.
- The `swftophp` tool does not properly handle error conditions or invalid input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leaks during parsing.
- Application instability as the memory leak accumulates.
- Resource exhaustion of the system running `swftophp`.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted SWF file to the `swftophp` utility.
- Attackers can manipulate the header section of the SWF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted SWF file to the `swftophp` utility.
- The attacker needs to have the `swftophp` utility installed or be able to execute it.
