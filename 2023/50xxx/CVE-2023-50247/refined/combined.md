# QUIC state exhaustion DoS

Low

[kazuho](/kazuho)
published
GHSA-2ch5-p59c-7mv6
Dec 12, 2023

## Package

h2o

## Affected versions

commits up to 3576054

## Patched versions

commit d67e81d and above

## Description

### Impact

The QUIC stack (quicly), as used by H2O up to commit [3576054](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab), is susceptible to a state exhaustion attack.

When H2O is serving HTTP/3, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to progressively increase the memory retained by the QUIC stack. This can eventually cause H2O to abort due to memory exhaustion.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been resolved in commit [d67e81d](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35).

It is recommended for H2O instances running with HTTP/3 support to be updated to commit [d67e81d](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35) or a later version.

### Workarounds

HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are not affected by this vulnerability as they do not use QUIC. Administrators looking to mitigate this issue without upgrading can disable HTTP/3 support. For guidance on this, see [HTTP/3 configuration directives](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http3_directives.html).

### References

This vulnerability is an instance of a missspecification (or an oversight) of [the QUIC version 1 protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000), which was reported by [@marten-seemann](https://github.com/marten-seemann).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
