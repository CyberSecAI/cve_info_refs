*  These scripts are executed when a user visits the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through input fields or parameters within the plugin.
*   The specific attack vector will depend on the exact location of the vulnerable code within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
