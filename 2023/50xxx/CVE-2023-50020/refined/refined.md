Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper handling of the `SIGPIPE` signal when the SCTP connection is closed abruptly. When a peer closes the connection, and the application attempts to write to the socket, a `SIGPIPE` signal is generated, which can lead to a crash if not handled correctly.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when `EPOLLIN`, `EPOLLOUT`, and `EPOLLRDHUP` events occur simultaneously on the socket.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The vulnerability lies in the insufficient error handling within the `ogs-epoll.c` file, related to how the `EPOLLRDHUP` event is processed.
- The code was not correctly setting the `when` variable, causing it to attempt to write to a closed connection when `EPOLLRDHUP` is received, leading to `SIGPIPE`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) component of the Open5GS core network.
- A malicious actor could intentionally trigger this crash, causing service disruption by repeatedly cycling the gNB on and off while the UE sends registration requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves exploiting the SCTP connection behavior between the AMF and gNB/eNodeB.
- An attacker could simulate a UE and repeatedly initiate connections and then abruptly close them or turn the gNB on/off cyclically, causing the AMF to attempt to write to a closed socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the AMF, acting as a simulated UE or a manipulated gNB.
- The attacker must be able to control the network connectivity to cause a condition where the SCTP connection is closed abruptly.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue is triggered by a specific sequence of events, namely, the simultaneous occurrence of `EPOLLIN`, `EPOLLOUT`, and `EPOLLRDHUP` events.
- The fix involved modifying `lib/core/ogs-epoll.c` to correctly handle the `EPOLLRDHUP` event. This ensures that the code does not attempt to write to a socket that has been closed.
- The fix implemented in commit `1aba814938e3a1b2eec7014bf6ce132d34622e08` addressed the issue by setting the correct flags (`when |= OGS_POLLIN; when &= ~OGS_POLLOUT;`) when EPOLLRDHUP is received.
- The fix is part of the issue2734 branch.
- The issue was resolved after a code change.
