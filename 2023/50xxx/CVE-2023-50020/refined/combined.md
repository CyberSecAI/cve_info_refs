| Open5GS Release, Revision, or Tag v2.6.6 Steps to reproduce Please set up the environment following the instructions at [https://github.com/s5uishida/open5gs\_5gc\_ueransim\_sample\_config](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/url), we use just one UE and one UPF.  Run the following script on the UE for about 10 minutes with the gNB turned off. This will result in the AMF having a large number of packets to process.  ``` #!/bin/bash while true;do         sudo ./nr-ue -c ../config/open5gs-ue0.yaml &         process_pid=$!         sleep 10         kill $process_pid         sleep 1 done ```  Then just try to cyclically turn the gNB on and off . [SIGPIPE.zip](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/files/13333131/SIGPIPE.zip) Logs ``` I have printed some logs in the function that polls and handles events to help me debug.  The attachments are the relevant logs and pcap.  As can be seen, when EPOLLIN,EPOLLOUT and EPOLLRDHUP occur at the same time, SIGPIPE also occurs.  11/13 16:55:43.340: [amf] DEBUG:     IP[192.168.182.134] RAN_ID[1] (../src/amf/ngap-path.c:70) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG: gmm_state_authentication(): AMF_EVENT_5GMM_MESSAGE (../src/amf/gmm-sm.c:1376) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] WARNING: Registration request (../src/amf/gmm-sm.c:1475) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] INFO: [suci-0-001-01-0000-0-0-0000000000]    SUCI (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:157) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     OLD TSC[UE:0,AMF:0] KSI[UE:7,AMF:7] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:224) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     NEW TSC[UE:0,AMF:0] KSI[UE:7,AMF:7] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:231) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [amf] WARNING: GUTI has already been allocated (../src/amf/context.c:1380) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     OLD TAI[PLMN_ID:00f110,TAC:1] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:275) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     OLD NR_CGI[PLMN_ID:00f110,CELL_ID:0x10] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:278) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     TAI[PLMN_ID:00f110,TAC:1] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:281) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     NR_CGI[PLMN_ID:00f110,CELL_ID:0x10] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:284) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [gmm] DEBUG:     SERVED_TAI_INDEX[0] (../src/amf/gmm-handler.c:311) { 	"supiOrSuci":	"suci-0-001-01-0000-0-0-0000000000", 	"servingNetworkName":	"5G:mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org" }11/13 16:55:43.340: [sbi] DEBUG: [POST] http://127.0.1.10:7777/nausf-auth/v1/ue-authentications (../lib/sbi/client.c:656) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [sbi] DEBUG: SENDING...[113] (../lib/sbi/client.c:432) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [sbi] DEBUG: { 	"supiOrSuci":	"suci-0-001-01-0000-0-0-0000000000", 	"servingNetworkName":	"5G:mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org" } (../lib/sbi/client.c:434) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [amf] INFO: rv = -2 . second cycle : queue_pop (../src/amf/init.c:140) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [core] INFO: after eopll_process , num_of_poll is 1 (../lib/core/ogs-epoll.c:215) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [core] INFO: received: 2005 (../lib/core/ogs-epoll.c:230) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [core] INFO: EPOLLIN event occurred (../lib/core/ogs-epoll. 11/13 16:55:43.340: [core] INFO: EPOLLOUT event occurred (../lib/core/ogs-epoll.c:259) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [core] INFO: EPOLLRDHUP event occurred (../lib/core/ogs-epoll.c:263) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [amf] DEBUG: SCTP_SHUTDOWN_EVENT:[T:32773, F:0x0, L:12] (../src/amf/ngap-sctp.c:191) 11/13 16:55:43.340: [amf] INFO: ogs_queue_push amf_sctp_event_push (../src/amf/event.c:104)  Thread 2 "open5gs-amfd" received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe.

Observed Behaviour AMF crashed on SIGPIPE eNodeB/gNodeB UERANSIM v3.2.6 UE Models and versions UERANSIM v3.2.6 |
