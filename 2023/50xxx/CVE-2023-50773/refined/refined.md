Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50773:

**CVE-2023-50773:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Dingding JSON Pusher Plugin stores access tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller, and these tokens are not masked in the job configuration form.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Plaintext Storage:** Access tokens are stored in plaintext within job configuration files, making them easily accessible.
    *   **Lack of Input Masking:** The job configuration form does not mask the tokens, further exposing them to observation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Item/Extended Read permissions or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the plaintext access tokens. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Dingding service, depending on the permissions associated with the tokens.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access to Job Configuration Files:** Attackers with access to the `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller can directly read the tokens.
    *   **Jenkins UI:** Attackers with Item/Extended Read permissions can view the unmasked tokens through the Jenkins job configuration form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Item/Extended Read permissions within Jenkins.
    *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there is no fix for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   This CVE is related to the masking of the tokens. There's also CVE-2023-50772 related to the storage of the tokens in plaintext, for the same plugin.
