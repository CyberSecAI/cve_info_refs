Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50093

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the application's (apiida API Gateway Manager) improper handling of the Host header in HTTP requests. The application uses the value from the Host header directly in the login form action and forgot password request URL, making it susceptible to Host Header Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The application trusts and uses the Host header value without proper validation or sanitization when constructing URLs.
- **Credential Theft:** By manipulating the Host header, an attacker can redirect the login form submission to an attacker-controlled domain, leading to credential theft.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential theft:** An attacker can steal user credentials (username and password) when a user submits the login form after a Host header injection.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could potentially use the stolen credentials for unauthorized access or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could use a MitM attack to intercept the request to the login page and modify the Host header before it reaches the user's browser.
- **Network Compromise:** If an attacker can compromise the network, they can manipulate the traffic to inject the malicious Host header.
- **DNS Poisoning:** An attacker could poison the DNS records to redirect the user to a malicious login page with a manipulated Host header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to intercept/modify HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the Host header value in HTTP requests. This could be done via a proxy, network access, or MitM attack.
- **Set up a malicious server:** The attacker needs a server under their control to receive the stolen credentials.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was tested on apiida API Gateway Manager v2023.2.2.
- The vulnerability affects both the login and the forgot password pages.
- The CVSSv3.1 score is 3.1, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates a low-severity vulnerability.
