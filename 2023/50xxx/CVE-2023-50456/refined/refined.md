- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation for user data, specifically first and last names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to the possibility of injecting malicious data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious data (e.g., phishing links) into the first or last name fields of user profiles. This malicious data can then be included in notification emails generated by the system, leading to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by providing malicious input in the first or last name fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify user data in the Zammad system. This would likely require an account within the system, and the ability to edit user profile information.
