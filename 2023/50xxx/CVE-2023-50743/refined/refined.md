Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-50743, as well as the related CVE-2023-50752 and CVE-2023-50753:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

The provided content details multiple SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities within the "Online Notice Board System v1.0" software developed by Kashipara Group. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into specific parameters. The system fails to properly validate user-supplied inputs before using them in database queries, leading to the SQL injection flaws.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CVE-2023-50743:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `dd` (day) parameter of the `registration.php` resource. The application directly inserts the value of the `dd` parameter into an SQL query without validation or sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `POST` request to `registration.php` with malicious SQL code in the `dd` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could manipulate the database leading to data exfiltration, data modification, and potentially complete system compromise.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required. Any user can send a malicious registration request.
*   **CVE-2023-50752:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `e` (email) parameter of the `login.php` resource. The application directly inserts the value of the `e` parameter into an SQL query without validation or sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `POST` request to `login.php` with malicious SQL code in the `e` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to CVE-2023-50743, an attacker could manipulate the database leading to data exfiltration, data modification, and potentially complete system compromise.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required. Any user can send a malicious login request.
*   **CVE-2023-50753:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `dd` (day) parameter of the `user/update_profile.php` resource. The application directly inserts the value of the `dd` parameter into an SQL query without validation or sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `POST` request to `user/update_profile.php` with malicious SQL code in the `dd` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to CVE-2023-50743 and CVE-2023-50752, an attacker could manipulate the database leading to data exfiltration, data modification, and potentially complete system compromise.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** User must be logged in to access the `user/update_profile.php` resource.

**Commonalities:**

*   All three vulnerabilities are SQL Injections stemming from a lack of input sanitization.
*   They all involve the use of `extract($_POST)` and directly embedding POST parameters into SQL queries.
*   They all occur in version 1.0 of the "Online Notice Board System" from Kashipara Group.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSSv3 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity rating. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, which translates to Network Attack Vector, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact and High Availability Impact.

**Mitigation:**

*   The provided document notes that no patch is currently available.
*   The suggested fix would be to implement proper input validation and sanitization before passing any user-supplied values to the database. This would involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Fluid Attacks.
*   The vendor website is <https://www.kashipara.com/>.
*   The vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed.

**Conclusion**

The information provided confirms that CVE-2023-50743, along with CVE-2023-50752 and CVE-2023-50753, are related to SQL Injection vulnerabilities within the Kashipara Group's "Online Notice Board System v1.0". The root cause is a lack of input sanitization, and exploitation can lead to significant security breaches.
