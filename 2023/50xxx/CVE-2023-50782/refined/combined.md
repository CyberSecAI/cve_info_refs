# The Marvin Attack

* [Paper](#paper)
* [Q&A](#question-answer)

The Marvin Attack is a return of a 25 year old vulnerability that
allows performing RSA decryption and signing operations as an attacker
with the ability to observe only the time of the decryption operation
performed with the private key.

In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that the error
messages given by SSL servers for errors in the PKCS #1 v1.5
padding allowed an adaptive-chosen ciphertext attack; this attack
fully breaks the confidentiality of TLS when used with RSA
encryption.
[In 2018](https://robotattack.org/),
Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young have
shown 19 years later that many internet servers were still vulnerable
to slight variations of the original attack.

We show that many implementations previously thought
immune, are vulnerable to the timing variant of the same attack.

While the main venue of attack are TLS servers, the core issues
that caused its wide spread are applicable to most
asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA, etc.),
not just to RSA. Lessons learned are also applicable to testing
the majority of cryptographic algorithms that can be vulnerable to
side-channel attacks, not just public key cryptography.

### What can the attackers gain?

For a vulnerable implementation the attacker is able to decrypt
RSA ciphertexts and forge signatures.

For a TLS server that defaults to RSA encryption key exchanges, that
means the attacker can record a session and decrypt it later.

For TLS hosts that use forward secure ciphersuites, the attacker
would have to perform a massively parallel attack to forge a server
signature before a client would time out during the connection attempt.
That makes the attack hard, but not impossible.

The attack is also applicable to other interfaces that perform
RSA decryption in automated manner but don't provide the attacker
ability to perform
arbitrary operations with the private key. Examples include
S/MIME, JSON web tokens, or hardware tokens (HSMs, smartcards, etc.).

### Who is affected?

We have identified the vulnerability in multiple implementations
and confirmed fixes in few of them,
but belive that most of cryptographic implementations are vulnerable
in practice.

We also found few APIs that are handling errors or numbers in a way

1. The API may be secure only if the returned data is used with a KDF that is fed also random, outside attacker's control, data, like in TLS

Finally, so far, we have verified just two implementations that
were not vulnerable
when tested in at least one environment:

| [BearSSL](https://www.bearssl.org/) 0.6 | Intel i9-12900KS @ 5.225 GHz, x86\_64, Friedman test negative (p-value=0.152, n=22.2M, k=36), 95% confidence interval for 25% trimmed mean of pairwise differences: ±466ps. |
| --- | --- |
| BoringSSL ([6 Sep 2023](https://github.com/google/boringssl/commit/be84aeed7), TLS) | Intel i9-12900KS @ 5.225 GHz, x86\_64, Friedman test negative (p-value=0.074, n=17.3M, k=36), 95% confidence interval for 45% trimmed mean of pairwise differences: ±574 ps. |
| [rustls](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) 0.21.9 (TLS) | no support for TLS\_RSA\_\* ciphersuites (inherently not vulnerable) |

Implementations not listed above have either not been tested
or have been verified as vulnerable, but the issues are still
embargoed.
We will continue updating the lists as we learn of new vulnerabilites
or once embargoes are lifted.

We have provided tools to detect the issue both on TLS server
level and help with testing on API level.

### What should I do?

If you use one of the affected implementations, you should install
the relevant updates. However we are reiterating the previous
recommendations:

#### Stop using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption!

On the TLS level, only servers that enable RSA encryption are
affected. Most modern clients support the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie
Hellman, thus disabling ciphersuites that use RSA encryption is
the recommended way to fix this vulnerability.

Older clients will be able to use Finite Field Diffie Hellman,
which will be secure as long as server uses fresh DHE key shares
for every connection (protection against the Raccoon attack) and
well known parameters (or safe primes in general) for the general
protection against cryptologic attacks. Both of those things
are trivial to check for and verify compared to testing, let alone
fixing, the issues in the RSA key exchange.

#### I depend on this legacy mode

While cryptographic protocols and formats allow, and have defaulted
to use of the
PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, they either don't need it any more for
interoperability (like TLS), or have been updated to support
RSA-OAEP (S/MIME, JWT, etc.). If your software or hardware doesn't
allow use of RSA-OAEP, pressure the vendor to fix it.

#### I'm a developer of a cryptographic library

Our recommendation is similar: deprecate and disable support for
PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for encryption. While we do provide a way to
handle errors in a way that should be compatible with any API
and not leak the information relevant to the Bleichenbacher attack
to the calling application **we recommend against its use**.

We have had 25 years of people trying to patch this fundamentally
broken padding mode. ROBOT have shown that the far easier workaround
was implemented incorrectly by a large number of implementations.
Implementing the
Marvin workaround *correctly* is much more tricky, as it must
include actually testing it for side channel leakage.

While we focus on PKCS#1 v1.5, the vulnerability is not limited
to just that mode, any RSA padding mode can be attacked if blinding is
not implemented using side-channel free code, or conversion from
numerical representation to a byte-string is not made using
side-channel free code. You should verify that the deblinding
operation and conversion to byte-string is side-channel free also
with RSA-OAEP and RSASVE interfaces. Only when you're able to
confidently verify that they are side-channel free, we would suggest
looking into making PKCS#1 v1.5 side-channel free.

Finally, we don't believe that this is limited to RSA itself,
any implementation that uses general purpose integer implementation
(like the default mode of OpenSSL's BIGNUM, NSS's MPI,
Java's BigInteger, Python's int, Rust's apint,
Gnu MP's mpz\_t, Go's math/big Int,
etc.) will suffer from the same issues. Given that there are attacks
that exploit high order bits being zero in other algorithms, like
[Minerva](https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/) against
ECDSA and [Raccoon attack](https://raccoon-attack.com/)
against FFDH (attack against ECDH works fundamentally the same way,
it just requires higher precision of the timing side-channel),
any cryptographic implementation that depends on general purpose
integer arithmetic library will be similarly vulnerable.
See the mpn interface of GNU MP for an example of an
[interface well suited for side-channel free programming](https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions#Low_002dlevel-functions-for-cryptography).

### How do I test for it?

We have released a
[script](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-pregenerate.py)
for testing TLS servers as well as
[instructions](https://tlsfuzzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timing-analysis.html)
on how to execute it.
It's very reliable (i.e. if it reports a vulnerability, there's
by default a 1 in 100 thousand chance that it's a false positive)
unless it's executed with --static-enc option, or executed
against a server that implements a Marvin workaround.

In case the server implements the Marvin workaround
(implicit rejection), you can
verify that that code is implemented correctly using either the
TLS based [test script](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-marvin.py),
or, in case you're testing the API directly,
[a script to generate decryption inputs](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/marvin-ciphertext-generator.py).

Upon execution the script reports the
[*p*-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)
of sign tests
and Friedman test. If they're consistently small or very small (smaller
than 10-9) then it's extremely likely that the tested
implementation is vulnerable.

For testing APIs, we've also prepared few scripts to make testing
them easier in the
[marvin-toolkit](https://github.com/tomato42/marvin-toolkit)
repo.

Please note that to *exclude* the possibility of a side channel
the test needs to report a 95% confidence interval for bootstrapped
differences of around a nanosecond and the statistical tests need
to still be negative (have *p*-values larger than
10-5). In practice that means collecting a data set
of at least few million connections.

### How do I fix it?

While we can't give general instructions, as any fixes depend on
where the leak happens and how the code is implemented, we wrote
a separate article about debugging the code with the use
of the tlsfuzzer tooling in the
[Debugging Timing Side-channel Leaks](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/09/29/debugging-timing-side-channel-leaks/) article.

#### Where does the Marvin name comes from?

The previous comprehensive attack against RSA was called ROBOT.
Given the
complexity and fragility of required fixes we don't believe that this
attack will generally go away. Thus we named it after an android
that lasted till the end of the universe in
*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

#### What are the technical details?

For the complete details, see
our [full technical
paper](marvin-attack-paper.pdf).

In technical terms, the Marvin Attack is not new, both
vulnerabilities
to timing side-channels and vulnerability of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
in general were known already in the 1990's.
The main contribution we bring is related to how to test for side
channel timing leakage in a way that provides high accuracy,
high precision (if provided with large data set), and thus very low
false positive rate.
Additionally, because we measure the whole end-to-end operation,
by performing a complete TLS handshake,
we're able to find issues in places other than the low level numerical
calls (e.g. the GnuTLS vulnerability was in code that was making a
decision about what kind of error message to print if debugging
mode was enabled) and able to test different implementations
relatively easily and quickly.

In other words, we got results because we were thorough, not
because we used novel techniques.

#### Is there a CVE for the Marvin Attack?

No. While it is a fundamental flaw in the RSA decryption, it
has been widely known that padding errors need to be handled in
constant time. But because of the complexity of implementing it in
practice, every implementation will likely have a slightly different
bug in the code.

#### How easy is it to carry out the attack? Is it practical?

Yes. We’ve been able to execute the attack against M2Crypto and
pyca/cryptography in just a couple of hours in a normal environment
on a mid-range laptop.
Estimating the practically of attacks on TLS servers is more complex as
it critically depends on the key sizes used, CPU model of the victim,
hardware and OS configuration, the RSA implementation in question, and
how closely to the server can the attacker
co-locate the probe measuring the response times.
For an attacker that can get access to a host connected to the
same network switch as the victim, a worst case scenario (for the
victim) would
require a few days to perform the attack against a vulnerable version
of OpenSSL and couple of hours to attack NSS.

#### The test script reports a very small side-channel, does it mean I'm not vulnerable in practice?

No. While previously the general consensus was that very small
side channels, on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds, were not
considered to be exploitable, that was based on flawed testing.

All statistical tests make some assumptions about tested data.
The most common assumption is that the compared samples are
[Independent and Identically Distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables) (IID).
That assumption is also central to the Box Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test and Mann-Whitney U test.
In practice, we haven't found that the timing data was independent,
in fact, for many tests of independence, just a few hundred
observations were sufficient to absolutely exclude that possibility.
For context, to get precise measurements we commonly need thousands to
millions of measurements, so the lack of independence will affect
large samples only more.

Since the requirements of the test were not met, it gave incorrect
results and thus incorrect
conclusions from it were drawn.

In our approach to testing, we use
[paired difference tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paired_difference_test) which require idependence of the
*differences* within pairs of measurements, not measurements
themselves. That property is much easier to achieve if we have
complete control over the executed test (in which order the individual
connections are executed), and is met for the collected data.

By using this kind of tests (sign test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
bootstrapping of the median of paired differences, etc.) we were able
to both show no false positives for very large samples in practice
(hundreds of millions of observations) and the ability to detect very
small
differences in timing, in the order of a few CPU clock cycles, even
when measuring across a production network, a few kilometers away,
and 6 router hops between
victim and attacker.

In other words, the size of the side channel affects only **how
many** observations will the attacker need to perform, **not if**
they will be able to measure the difference at all.

Also, because the paired difference tests require consistent
environment only within each pair, parallelization of the attack
is trivial.

#### Is the vulnerability currently being exploited by attackers?

While we have no reason to believe that the Marvin Atttack has been
exploited
in the wild prior to this disclosure, the original ROBOT attack did
suggest that timing variants of the vulnerability may also be possible.
Since the details of the
vulnerability are now public, attackers may start exploiting
it at any time, and we recommend taking the
countermeasures [explained above](#mitigation) as
soon as possible.

#### RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 has been known to be insecure for 25 years. What’s the big deal?

Indeed, while problems with RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding have been
known for over 25 years, and just as long we had alternatives
in form of RSA-OAEP, protocol and format designers valued backwards
compatibility over inheritent security of better options.
While protocols like S/MIME (a.k.a CMS) also date from that era,
protocols like JSON Web Tokens have been concieved well after
RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 was known to be hard to implement correctly, yet
included it anyway. We need to go to standards as new as WebCrypto
to find standards that omit this bad padding completely.

The other is complacency of implementers and protocol designers
in considering that there are side channels that are "too small to be
detectable". Best illustrated by subsequent versions of TLS, that
included more and more complex workarounds for the attacks against
ciphersuites with CBC padding and RSA key exchange, only to finally
remove them completely in TLS 1.3.

#### I don't use RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, only OAEP, does that mean I'm safe?

No. At least, not universally. Both OpenSSL and NSS bugs were in
the numerical library, not in the padding or error reporting code.
That code is shared between all padding modes, be it PKCS#1 v1.5, OAEP,
or RSASVE. As such, any decryption operation will leak the same kind
of information, and thus can be used to attack messages encrypted
with any padding method.

Only RSA-OAEP implementations that use constant-time mathematical
library (specifically, constant-time code for deblinding and
converstion of the large precision integer to a byte string),
and ignore the value of the first byte of padding will not
be vulnerable to the Marvin attack.

#### Does the Marvin Attack allow an attacker to steal the server’s private key?

No. The Marvin Attacks allows an attacker to decrypt one ciphertext
(connection) or sign a message at a
time. The attacker does not learn the server’s private
key.

#### Can the Marvin Attack be also used to perform MitM attacks?

Yes, but not easily. If the server supports RSA key exchange
and is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack
it's possible to forge a signature on an arbitrary message,
including a ServerKeyExchange in TLS 1.2 or CertificateVerify in
TLS 1.3. The difficulty is that both of those signatures include
a random value selected by a client. Thus the signature needs to be
forged before the connection times out on the client side. In practice
that means that the attacker will need to attack multiple servers
at once, all of which will need to provide quite clear timing signal.

#### Do I need to get a new certificate for my server?

Probably not. As the attacker does not learn the server’s
private key, there’s no need to obtain new certificates.
While continued use of the same key is necessary for the attacker
to be able to decrypt previous sessions, if the server doesn't
enable RSA encryption ciphersuites the attack is impossible
either way.

#### Do I need to update my browser?

Yes. While there is nothing practical that web browsers or other
client software can do to prevent the Marvin Attack on TLS servers.
The WebCrypto in Firefox does support RSA-OEAP decryption operation
that is vulnerable (CVE-2023-5388), as such you should install
Firefox 124 or Firefox ESR 115.9.0 to fix that.

#### Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?

Possibly. If you run a server and can be certain no one
made a large number of connections that attempted RSA key exchange
to any of your
servers (for example, by examining IDS or server logs), then
you weren’t attacked. Your logs may contain a small number of
RSA key exchange connections from the Internet-wide scans or
very old clients. In best case scenario an attack requires
tens of thousands of connections per decryption.

#### My cryptographic module is FIPS certified, do I still have to take action?

Yes. FIPS certification for cryptographic modules doesn't require
robust testing of side-channel protections.
Only on Level 4 certification are *protections* against
side-channel attacks mandatory.

#### SSLLabs says I have RSA disabled. That means I’m safe, right?

Unfortunately, no. Although [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
provides an invaluable suite of security tests, right now it
only checks whether your HTTPS server directly allows RSA key exchange.
You’re just as much at risk if your site’s certificate or key
is used anywhere else on a server that does support RSA.
Common examples include SMTP, IMAP, and POP mail servers, and
secondary HTTPS servers used for specific web
applications.

#### Are you planning to release the code for your implementation of the attack?

Sort of... while we have already released the tlsfuzzer scripts
to check if a server is vulnerable or not (i.e. tool to run a single
oracle call), and a toolkit to make testing APIs easier,
we do not plan to release a complete attack script.

#### What factors contributed to the Marvin Attack?

Testing for constant-timeness is *hard*.
While there exists a
[multitude of tools](https://neuromancer.sk/article/26)
to do that, their usability is not conducive to them
being used by
[developers](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/publications/pdf/2022-sp-jancar.pdf)
or [researchers](https://neuromancer.sk/article/29).

Any tool that requires code annotations to work is also
subject to user error.

The other factor is the disregard of small side-channels,
for example, in TLS 1.2 specification we read:
> This leaves a small timing channel, since MAC
> performance depends to some extent on the size of the data fragment,
> but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable, due to
> the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
> timing signal.

[RFC5246](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#page-24)

#### Why did this research take so long?

While indeed the first CVEs were assigned in 2020, the last major
fixes were performed in 2023. This was caused by two problems:
first is that we were struggling with false positives caused by
the timing signal generated by the *harness* (test script),
and that caused the other issue. Because of unreliable results
it was hard to pinpoint the particular cause for the timing signal
and without that, it was hard to convince upstream developers to
work on the issue. Only when we created a constant-time test
harness were we able to move forward with fixes (and that happened
in the middle of 2022).

#### I'd like to learn about side-channel attacks, do you have some example code for that?

Yes. If you'd like to see if side-channel attacks are easy
to perform against particularly vulnerable services, or
how introduction of a network between the attacker and the
victim impacts the statistical tests, or even try to implement
simple password comparison using side-channel free code,
we have published a blog post with relevant resources:
[Experiment with side-channel attacks yourself!](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/10/16/experiment-with-side-channel-attacks-yourself/)

#### How is this related to previous research?

First practical timing attacks against DH, RSA, and DSA were presented
[by Paul Kocher in 1996.](https://paulkocher.com/doc/TimingAttacks.pdf).

Originally this type of attack was
[discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher in 1998](http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf).

Klima, Pokorny and Rosa
[improved the attack and discovered the bad-version oracle in 2003](https://eprint.iacr.org/2003/052).

In 2012 Romain Bardou and others [developed a much more efficient Bleichenbacher attack algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/417)
that reduces the number of needed connections.

In 2014
[Christopher Meyer and others discovered Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities in JSSE and other products](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/meyer)
and describe the first practical timing attacks.

Tibor Jager and colleagues discovered that
[it is possible to use a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher attack against TLS 1.3 and QUIC](https://www.nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2015/08/21/Tls13QuicAttacks.pdf).

The [DROWN attack](https://drownattack.com/) is a protocol
level Bleichenbacher vulnerability in SSL version 2. The DROWN research
also contains further insights on cross-protocol scenarios.

In 2018, Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young
[did show that a lot of HTTPS
hosts are still vulnerable against a slight variation of the original
Bleichenbacher attack](https://robotattack.org/).

In 2019, Eyal Ronen and others have
[shown that a
lot of cryptographic libraries can be attacked using cache timing
attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835216).

### **[tomato42](/tomato42)** commented [Oct 26, 2023](#issue-1963716989) • edited Loading

| Different comments around [CVE-2020-25659](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hggm-jpg3-v476 "CVE-2020-25659") (like in [#6167](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6167) and [#5507](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/5507)) state that the fix is incomplete and documentation (<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/limitations/#rsa-pkcs1-v1-5-constant-time-decryption>) specifies that PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption padding is vulnerable to side-channel attacks.  I'm filing this issue with the evidence that this is a confirmed fact, not just an assertion based on code analysis.  While I've executed it with python3-cryptography-3.2.1-6.el8.x86\_64, python36-3.6.8-38.module+el8.5.0+12207+5c5719bc.x86\_64, and openssl-1.1.1k-10.el8\_9 both the cryptography package has the [CVE-2020-25659](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hggm-jpg3-v476 "CVE-2020-25659") fix and openssl has the [CVE-2022-4304](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p52g-cm5j-mjv4 "CVE-2022-4304") fix.  The test was executed with 2048 bit RSA, with 100k repeats per probe, in a VM on a fairly noisy/busy 2.3GHz Icelake Xeon system.  The measured side channel is about 400ns, so it should be fairly easy to exploit even over remote network connections.  analysis.py summary:  ``` tlsfuzzer analyse.py version 5 analysis Sign test mean p-value: 0.3447, median p-value: 0.1886, min p-value: 2.459e-13 Friedman test (chisquare approximation) for all samples p-value: 8.947806111025913e-27 Worst pair: 1(no_header_with_payload_48), 6(valid_48) Mean of differences: -5.35165e-07s, 95% CI: -1.51931e-06s, 4.859572e-07s (±1.003e-06s) Median of differences: -4.50001e-07s, 95% CI: -5.85012e-07s, -3.309875e-07s (±1.270e-07s) Trimmed mean (5%) of differences: -5.91658e-07s, 95% CI: -9.38480e-07s, -2.549461e-07s (±3.418e-07s) Trimmed mean (25%) of differences: -5.80887e-07s, 95% CI: -7.53559e-07s, -4.100913e-07s (±1.717e-07s) Trimmed mean (45%) of differences: -4.75457e-07s, 95% CI: -6.04405e-07s, -3.463844e-07s (±1.290e-07s) Trimean of differences: -6.01688e-07s, 95% CI: -8.09003e-07s, -3.924847e-07s (±2.083e-07s)  ```  Results for comparisons between individual samples are in the [report.csv](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/files/13178886/report.csv)  Graphical representation of the confidence intervals of the difference between different classes to class 0: [conf_interval_plot_trim_mean_45](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/618246/278377723-65112fee-d71b-4267-bc4c-d6a2b8c7d431.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY5NDIxMjAsIm5iZiI6MTczNjk0MTgyMCwicGF0aCI6Ii82MTgyNDYvMjc4Mzc3NzIzLTY1MTEyZmVlLWQ3MWItNDI2Ny1iYzRjLWQ2YTJiOGM3ZDQzMS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTE1JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExNVQxMTUwMjBaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT01MTRhMGJkMDhlZmZmNzgwNWQ3OTBkODljYzZkNzI5YTU3NTYwNmI5MDQwOTY5MDZhODk5NzFhYjg2MzViNTA1JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.CVRBUwP7YMRXuiVGfGqlvJsYLx8UONTdC7EBGaqRoUY) mapping numbers to classes is in [legend.csv](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/files/13178961/legend.csv) explanation of the ciphertexts generated is in the [step2.py](https://github.com/tomato42/marvin-toolkit/blob/master/step2.py) script.

| Yes, Hubert's `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection` feature is in OpenSSL 3.2. Even better, it is **enabled** by default.  OpenSSL 3.0 in CentOS 9 Stream and RHEL 9.3 have a [backport](https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/openssl/-/blob/c9s/0120-RSA-PKCS15-implicit-rejection.patch?ref_type=heads) of the feature. (And yes, the backport [broke](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2203840) `test_decrypt_invalid_decrypt`). |

| We landed a skip for that test when handling the implicit rejection in [7e33b0e](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/7e33b0e7739d633c77b8c478620167f693ed13f4)  We'll undoubtedly start shipping OpenSSL 3.2.0 in our wheels when it is final, and at least one distribution has already backported -- is there anything we should change in our documentation here? |

| Maybe link from documentation also to this issue, so that it's clear that the statements in the documentation are backed by real data?  Technically, it could list that the API will be secure if used together with OpenSSL that implements implicit rejection, but then *people really should stop using PKCS#1v1.5* so I'd rather not do that.  If you decide to fix it, I think a small rephrasing in that section would be good:  ``` For this reason we recommend not implementing online protocols that use RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption with cryptography –  independent of this limitation, such protocols generally have poor security properties due to their lack of forward security.  ```  The problem is not online protocols, it's any kind of interface which the attacker can measure the timing of. Online *contexts,* as stated in first sentence, would be better. But then there are situations in which seemingly offline systems can be attacked too: <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/hackers-can-steal-cryptographic-keys-by-video-recording-connected-power-leds-60-feet-away/> or <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/new-attack-steals-e-mail-decryption-keys-by-capturing-computer-sounds/> (the same side-channels can be used to measure processing much more precisely, or in situations where the decryptions are performed in batch operations, e.g. an email client that decrypts messages right after downloading them) |

| hi [@alex](https://github.com/alex) , Thanks for your update!  I can see that cryptography-42.0.0 is now available in pip3 installation.  We're about to perform release 42.0, which will resolve this via upgrading our OpenSSL to 3.2.0.  Which openssl library do you refer here? Is it pyOpenSSL? The latest for pyOpenSSL is still at version 23.3.0, and it is **incompatible** with cryptography-**42.0.0**:  ``` ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts. pyopenssl 23.3.0 requires cryptography<42,>=41.0.5, but you have cryptography 42.0.0 which is incompatible.  ```  Is it an issue with <https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl>?  Best regards |

| FWIW, the fix is not in PyCA cryptography but in OpenSSL 3.2.0. If you use the cryptography binary wheels, then you have to update to 42.0.0.  If you use downstream Linux or BSD packages from your vendor, then the version of PyCA cryptography does **not** matter. Your vendor must either ship OpenSSL 3.2.0 or have a backport of the 3.2.0 fix. Supported versions of Fedora, RHEL 8/9, and CentOS stream c8s/c9s have a fix for the timing problem for a while now.  There is an easy way to detect whether a build is affected by the timing vulnerability. If the following code raises an exception, then you are vulnerable. If it returns random junk, then your OpenSSL has `EVP_PKEY_CTRL_RSA_IMPLICIT_REJECTION` enabled and you are fine.  ``` >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding, rsa >>> rsa.generate_private_key(65537, 2048).decrypt(b"\x00" * 256, padding.PKCS1v15())  ``` |

| I have a question. This problem occurs because cryptography invokes the OpenSSL API, and the decryption time of the corresponding OpenSSL API is not constant-time logic (prior to OpenSSL version3.2.0). Why is this CVE not assigned to OpenSSL (a new CVE number)? After all, directly invoking the OpenSSL interface in other ways also leak time information. |

| This problem occurs because cryptography invokes the OpenSSL API, and the decryption time of the corresponding OpenSSL API is not constant-time logic.  No, since the fix to [CVE-2022-4304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304) OpenSSL's API will decrypt RSA ciphertexts in constant-time.  The problem is that before OpenSSL 3.2.0 (or before inclusion of implicit rejection) OpenSSL will return errors in case padding check fails. It still returns errors in the same amount of time as a result from decryption, so the API is side-channel safe. The problem is that pyca/cryptography changes that error into an exception, which causes different code path to be taken, and thus make execution take different amount of time. It's pyca/caryptography that introduces the side-channel leakage.  In 3.2.0 (or with implicit rejection) OpenSSL doesn't return errors, it returns a deterministically random message in case padding check fails. Since there is no error[1], pyca/crypptography doesn't raise an exception and thus doesn't create a side-channel leakage.  1 - more precisely, implicit rejection decouples the error being returned from the PKCS#1v1.5-compliance of the plaintext, which makes the API return uncorrelated with the first byte of the plaintext being a zero byte. See the Marvin paper for details.  Yes, both the score and description for [CVE-2023-50782](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3ww4-gg4f-jr7f "CVE-2023-50782") is incorrect, it's not about TLS, it's about RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption. And the CVSS should be the same as for [CVE-2020-25659](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hggm-jpg3-v476 "CVE-2020-25659"). I've send an email to Red Hat Product Security to fix that, but I guess it got stuck in queue or something... |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c0)  Robb Gatica    2023-12-13 21:45:44 UTC  ``` Description: The fix for [CVE-2020-25659](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25659) is not addressing the leakage in the RSA decryption. Because of the API design, the fix is generally not believed to be possible to be fully addressed. The issue can be mitigated by using a cryptographic backed that implements implicit rejection (Marvin workaround). Only applications that use RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding are affected.  Implicit rejection in RHEL has shipped in 9.3.0. Will ship in 9.2.eus, 8.6.eus, 8.8.eus, and 8.9.z. No other releases are planned  References: <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/9785> <https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/> <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c2)  Robb Gatica    2023-12-13 22:17:30 UTC  ``` Created python-cryptography tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 2254438](show_bug.cgi?id=2254438 "CLOSED NOTABUG - TRIAGE CVE-2023-50782 python-cryptography: Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack against RSA decryption - incomplete fix for CVE-2020-25659 [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c5)  Sandipan Roy    2023-12-14 04:51:10 UTC  ``` Created python-cryptography tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-38 [[bug 2254465](show_bug.cgi?id=2254465 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2023-50782 python-cryptography: Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack against RSA decryption - incomplete fix for CVE-2020-25659 [fedora-38]")] Affects: fedora-39 [[bug 2254466](show_bug.cgi?id=2254466 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2023-50782 python-cryptography: Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack against RSA decryption - incomplete fix for CVE-2020-25659 [fedora-39]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c6)  Christian Heimes    2024-01-02 08:52:04 UTC  ``` python-cryptography on Fedora is not affected by the timing oracle vulnerability, because Fedora's OpenSSL comes with a backport of implicit rejection for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption. The mitigation prevents timing attacks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c7)  Alicja Kario    2024-01-04 15:53:32 UTC  ``` Note: this is mitigated through changes in RHEL-9 openssl since openssl-3.0.7-24.el9 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:6627](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023%3A6627)) and in RHEL-8 openssl since openssl-1.1.1k-12.el8_9 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7877](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7877))   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c10)  Christian Heimes    2024-01-31 11:49:29 UTC  ``` Actually the "fixed version" is incorrect for Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL. The fix for the CVE is not in python-cryptography but in OpenSSL.  The binary packages from upstream PyCA Cryptography are no longer affected by the bug, because they are shipping binaries with OpenSSL 3.2.0. Upstream OpenSSL 3.2.0 comes with a fix for the timing oracle.  Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL are not using the binary packages from upstream. We are building against our own copy of OpenSSL. Our OpenSSL packages have a backport of the 3.2.0 mitigation since mid of last year. See Hubert's [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=2254432#c7).   ``` |  |

fixes [#13421](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13421)

The code is functional (behaves the same as the implementation in NSS and tlslite-ng).

We need to decide if we want to cache the `d_hash` value or not.

##### Checklist

* documentation is added or updated
* tests are added or updated

| [@t8m](https://github.com/t8m) do you plan to merge it to 3.1.0 later?  There is currently no plan to merge it to 3.1 branch.  [@t8m](https://github.com/t8m) I am not sure if you remember this old pull-request. But may I ask you why there is currently no plan to merge it to 3.1 branch? What prevented you from backporting this PR to the OpenSSL 3.1/3.0?  There is already a patch for this pull-request included in the downstream OpenSSL 3.1 RPM package on Fedora Linux 39. <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/openssl/blob/f39/f/0079-RSA-PKCS15-implicit-rejection.patch>  And there is also already a patch for this pull-request included in the downstrem OpenSSL 3.0 RPM package on Feodra Linux 38. <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/openssl/blob/f38/f/0100-RSA-PKCS15-implicit-rejection.patch>  So, I assume preparing the patches for the OpenSSL 3.1/3.0 is relatively easy. For example, if [@tomato42](https://github.com/tomato42) will send the pull-requests into both the `openssl-3.1` and `openssl-3.0` branches, could you help to review the pull-requests? |

| This is clearly a feature and thus it is not eligible to be merged to stable branches.  [@t8m](https://github.com/t8m) Thanks for your reply. If you think this PR is about a feature, not backporting to the stable branches makes sense to me.  While this PR adds the `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection`, I was thinking this PR is about a security fix. If a change is about a security fix, you would generally backport it to the stable branches, right?  While I can see the [CVE-2020-25659](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25659) for python-cryptography and [CVE-2020-25657](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25657) for m2crypto in `CHANGES.md` of this PR, does not OpenSSL project have the own CVE ID? |

| No, we do not regard this issue as a security issue and we did not assign a CVE to it.  [@t8m](https://github.com/t8m) OK. Why do you think you don't regard this issue as a security issue?  Perhaps, do you think that in OpenSSL 3.1 or older versions, using the RSA decryption API safely is a responsibility of users or applications using OpenSSL C APIs? If you think so, could you create a document in this repository or somewhere to guide users about how to use the RSA decryption API safely in OpenSSL 3.1 or earlier versions? Or Is there already such a document? |

| <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/RSA_private_decrypt.html>  ``` WARNINGS  Decryption failures in the RSA_PKCS1_PADDING mode leak information which can potentially be used to mount a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. This is an inherent weakness in the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding design. Prefer RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING.  ```  The newer man page is much more explicit: <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/EVP_PKEY_decrypt.html>  ``` In OpenSSL versions before 3.2.0, when used in PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, both the return value from the EVP_PKEY_decrypt() and the outlen provided information useful in mounting a Bleichenbacher attack against the used private key. They had to processed in a side-channel free way.  ``` |

   Instead of patch configure, patch m4 files and use autoconf to generate
   configure.

   PHP 8.2.20 (2024-06-06)

   - CGI:
     . Fixed buffer limit on Windows, replacing read call usage by _read.
       (David Carlier)
     . Fixed bug GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv (Bypass of CVE-2012-1823, Argument Injection
       in PHP-CGI). (CVE-2024-4577) (nielsdos)

     . Fixed bug GH-13970 (Incorrect validation of #[Attribute] flags type for
       non-compile-time expressions). (ilutov)
     . Fixed bug GH-14140 (Floating point bug in range operation on Apple Silicon
       hardware). (Derick, Saki)

   - DOM:
     . Fix crashes when entity declaration is removed while still having entity
       references. (nielsdos)
     . Fix references not handled correctly in C14N. (nielsdos)
     . Fix crash when calling childNodes next() when iterator is exhausted.
       (nielsdos)
     . Fix crash in ParentNode::append() when dealing with a fragment
       containing text nodes. (nielsdos)

   - FFI:
     . Fixed bug GH-14215 (Cannot use FFI::load on CRLF header file with
       apache2handler). (nielsdos)

   - Opcache:
     . Fixed bug GH-14109 (Fix accidental persisting of internal class constant in
       shm). (ilutov)

   - OpenSSL:
     . The openssl_private_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
       (OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack
       unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes the changes from this pull
       request: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817 (rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection).
       These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2 and have also been backported to stable
       versions of various Linux distributions, as well as to the PHP builds provided for
       Windows since the previous release. All distributors and builders should ensure that
       this version is used to prevent PHP from being vulnerable. (CVE-2024-2408)

   - Standard:
     . Fixed bug GHSA-9fcc-425m-g385 (Bypass of CVE-2024-1874).

### **[mbartosch](/mbartosch)** commented [Aug 7, 2024](#issuecomment-2273943595)

| I am currently in the process of debugging a problem that seems to happen in conjunction with this patch.  This came to my attention due to a problem that occurred after upgrading OpenSSL to openssl-1:1.1.1k-12.el8\_9.x86\_64 on a Rocky Linux 8 system. The same happens on a RedHat RHEL 8 system. According to the RedHat changelogs, this patch has been backported into RedHat's OpenSSL.  Problem description: When performing an `openssl cms -decrypt` using an RSA key in a PKCS#11 token, the decryption fails with a hard error:  ``` openssl cms -decrypt -in rocky-ciphertext-softhsm.cms -inform pem -recip softhsm-cert.pem -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -inkey "pkcs11:model=SoftHSM%20v2;manufacturer=SoftHSM%20project;serial=064c221662be4c79;token=Testtoken;id=%D8%A8%DB%E0%D6%37%1F%BE%DE%C2%B2%08%FF%6F%A2%E3%8C%61%62%D0;object=rsatest1" engine "pkcs11" set. Enter PKCS#11 token PIN for Testtoken: Error decrypting CMS structure 140457840785216:error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:crypto/evp/evp_enc.c:643:  ```  I have verified that the same happens with a Nitrokey HSM2 and an nCipher Edge HSM, so I am pretty sure that the problem is not related to a particular HSM type or PKCS#11 library.  After downgrading RedHat openssl to a previous version that does not include this patch, the above command works without problem. |

| [@mbartosch](https://github.com/mbartosch) this should be filed as a separate issue, preferably with a complete stand-alone reproducer  that being said, use of `-recip` should be unaffected if the ciphertext matches the key... |
