The provided content relates to **CVE-2023-50262**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how dompdf handles SVG image references. It fails to properly validate chained references between two or more SVG documents, leading to infinite recursion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of chained SVG image references.
- Lack of depth checking in SVG image recursion validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: The infinite recursion consumes memory and CPU resources, potentially leading to a crash of the application or server.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated exploitation can exhaust server resources, preventing legitimate requests from being processed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: Attacker can send specially crafted HTML documents with chained SVG references to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious HTML document to the dompdf service, which will parse and render the included SVG images.
- No privileges or user interaction is required.
