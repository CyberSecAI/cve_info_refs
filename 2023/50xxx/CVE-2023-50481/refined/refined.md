The provided content relates to CVE-2023-50481.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of outdated encryption algorithms and fixed initialization vectors within the `blinksocks` project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Usage of non-random Initialization Vectors (IVs)** in CBC and CFB modes. Specifically, the files `lib/presets/ssr-auth-aes128.js` (line 100) and `lib/presets/ssr-auth-chain.js` (line 163) use fixed IVs.
2.  **Usage of insecure symmetric-key algorithm RC4.** This algorithm is considered weak and insecure. Specifically, it is used in `lib/presets/ssr-auth-chain.js` at lines 173, 278, 391 and 436.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to data leakage, data tampering, and other security vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit these weaknesses by potentially performing attacks such as:
*   Decrypting traffic if the same IV is used with the same key in CBC/CFB mode.
*   Compromising the confidentiality and/or integrity of the data stream due to the weaknesses of RC4

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to intercept the network traffic and have the ability to analyze and manipulate it.
