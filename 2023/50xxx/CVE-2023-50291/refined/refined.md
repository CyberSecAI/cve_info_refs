Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50291:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Inconsistent redaction logic for Java system properties. The `/admin/info/properties` endpoint only hid properties with "password" in the name, failing to redact other sensitive properties like "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials: Sensitive information, such as passwords, were exposed through the `/admin/info/properties` endpoint because the redaction logic was incomplete.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials. Attackers with `config-read` permissions could view these credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to Solr resources and potentially other systems if the leaked credentials are used elsewhere.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the `/admin/info/properties` endpoint via a web browser or API calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the `config-read` permission in a Solr Cloud environment with authorization enabled to exploit the vulnerability.

**Versions Affected:**
- Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
- Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache Solr version 8.11.3 or 9.3.0 or later
- As a workaround, users can use the following Java system property: `-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=".*(password|secret|basicauth).*"`.
