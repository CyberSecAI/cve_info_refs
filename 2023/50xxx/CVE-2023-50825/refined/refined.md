Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the "iframe Shortcode" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into the plugin's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Redirects:**  Injected scripts can redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Advertisements:**  Attackers can inject unwanted advertisements.
- **Other HTML Payloads:** The ability to inject arbitrary HTML allows a wide range of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Input:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious code through user-supplied input that is processed by the plugin. This most likely occurs via shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Contributor Level Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" privileges on the WordPress site. This suggests the vulnerability exists in the way shortcodes are handled and displayed to users with this level of access.

**Additional Notes:**
- **No Official Fix:** There is currently no official fix available for the vulnerability.
- **Low Priority:** The vulnerability is marked as a low priority and is considered unlikely to be exploited, according to the source.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5.
- **Vulnerable Versions:** The plugin versions <= 2.0 are vulnerable.
