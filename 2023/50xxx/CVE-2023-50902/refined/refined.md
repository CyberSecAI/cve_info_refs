- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress New User Approve plugin (versions <= 2.5.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on their behalf, while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that is unknowingly submitted by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting the crafted request, typically by enticing the user to click a malicious link or visit a compromised website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
