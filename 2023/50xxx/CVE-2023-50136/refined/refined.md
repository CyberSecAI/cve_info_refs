The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JFinalcms version v5.0.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when handling user-supplied data in the custom table functionality of JFinalcms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to various consequences, including:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious code into the custom table feature. This payload is stored by the application.
- When another user views the content containing the injected payload, the attacker's script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify content within the custom table feature of JFinalcms. This likely requires an authenticated user account with sufficient privileges.
- The attacker does not necessarily require direct access to the server, only the application's interface.

**Additional Details**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) is: `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`.
- The PoC shows the injection of an HTML image tag that, upon error (due to invalid 'src'), executes the JavaScript `alert(1)`. This confirms the successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
