- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `JmsSetting::getSecondImgs()` method in the Joommasters - Jms Setting module for PrestaShop contains a vulnerable SQL call that doesn't sanitize the `productids` parameter, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection (CWE-89). The module directly includes the unsanitized `productids` parameter into a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Technical and personal data leaks
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
    - Display sensitive tables in the front-office, potentially revealing admin Ajax scripts of modules protected by tokens.
    - The vulnerability is also actively used to deploy webskimmers to steal credit cards.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, through a crafted HTTP request to `modules/jmssetting/initajax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated guest.
