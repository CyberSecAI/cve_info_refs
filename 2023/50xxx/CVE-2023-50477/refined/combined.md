### **[tianjk99](/tianjk99)** commented [Dec 4, 2023](#issue-2023385063)

| A security issue was found in your project. I hope you will check whether this approach poses security risks.   1. src/common/util/getRPCEndpoint.js, line 6.    The current implementation in getRPCEndpoint.js disables certificate validation by setting the rejectUnauthorized option of the https.Agent to false. This introduces a potential security risk.   It is recommended to enable certificate validation by setting rejectUnauthorized to true in the https.Agent configuration. This ensures secure and authenticated HTTPS connections. |
