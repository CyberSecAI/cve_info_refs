  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application disables certificate validation for HTTPS connections by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` option of the `https.Agent` to `false`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure TLS configuration",
      "Missing certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting and manipulating network traffic. This could lead to data breaches or the injection of malicious code, since the client does not verify the identity of the server it is connecting to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and server, or with the ability to control a network endpoint, could exploit the lack of certificate validation."
