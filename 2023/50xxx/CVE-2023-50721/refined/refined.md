Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the XWiki SearchAdmin interface not properly escaping the ID and label of search user interface extensions. This lack of escaping allows for the injection of XWiki syntax, including script macros (specifically Groovy macros), which can lead to remote code execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the failure to sanitize or escape user-provided input (specifically, the extension ID and label) before rendering it within the SearchAdmin interface.
- **XWiki Syntax Injection:** This vulnerability is a classic example of injection, where an attacker injects malicious code into a context where it will be interpreted and executed.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected Groovy code allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability has severe consequences:
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the XWiki instance.
- **Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Availability Impact:** Attackers could disrupt the availability of the XWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **UI Extension Injection:**  Attackers inject malicious code through a UI extension object by setting the "Extension ID" and "Extension Parameters" to include Groovy script macros.
- **Editable Wiki Pages:** The ability to add UI extensions on any document, including editable user profiles, provides an easy attack vector. An attacker does not need special access to the SearchAdmin page itself to inject the malicious code.
- **SearchAdmin Page:** The exploit is triggered when the vulnerable `XWiki.SearchAdmin` page is accessed and the injected code is rendered on the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker only needs the ability to edit wiki pages (like a user profile), which is often a default permission.
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based (as indicated by CVSS:3.1/AV:N), making the exploit possible remotely.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered upon loading the vulnerable `XWiki.SearchAdmin` page; no further user interaction is needed (as indicated by CVSS:3.1/UI:N).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in XWiki 4.5-rc-1 with the search UI implementation.
- The issue has been fixed in XWiki versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1 by adding necessary escaping to the affected code.
- A workaround involves manually applying a patch to the `XWiki.SearchAdmin` page.
- The provided commit diff highlights changes made to `SearchAdmin.xml` to escape the extension ID and label, using `$escapetool.xml()`.
- There are unit tests provided in the commit diff, `SearchAdminPageTest.java`, that show that an attacker could inject javascript via the UI extension ID and label.
