The provided content is related to CVE-2023-50252.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe merging of attributes when parsing the `<use>` tag in the `php-svg-lib` library. Specifically, when a `<use>` tag references an `<image>` tag, the `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag overwrites the `href` attribute of the referenced `<image>` tag without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe attribute merging: The library merges attributes from a `<use>` tag with the referenced element, including the `href` attribute, without validation.
- Lack of sanitization: The `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag is not sanitized before being used to load an image, allowing for the injection of malicious URLs, including `phar://` URLs.
- PHAR deserialization:  In PHP < 8, using `phar://` URLs can lead to dangerous deserialization, potentially leading to file deletion (denial of service) or remote code execution (RCE).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- In PHP < 8, successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file deletion (denial of service) or remote code execution (RCE).
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass existing sanitization of image `href` attributes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted SVG file containing a `<use>` tag that references an `<image>` tag with a malicious `href` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious SVG file that includes a `<use>` tag referencing an `<image>` tag with a crafted `href`.
- No specific privileges or user interaction are required. The attacker only needs the application to parse the crafted SVG.
