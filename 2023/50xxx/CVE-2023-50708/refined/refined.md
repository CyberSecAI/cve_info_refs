Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50708:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-50708. It describes a timing attack vulnerability in the `yiisoft/yii2-authclient` library, specifically within its OAuth1, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect implementations. The vulnerability arises from the usage of standard string comparison (`strcmp`) instead of a timing-attack-safe comparison, which is addressed in the provided patch.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcmp()` to compare state parameters in OAuth1 and OAuth2 flows, and the `nonce` in OpenID Connect flows.  `strcmp()` is susceptible to timing attacks because it returns on the first character mismatch, which leaks information about the string. An attacker can exploit this to deduce the correct value of the state/nonce.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The use of `strcmp()` for comparing security-sensitive strings.
*   **Lack of Constant-Time Comparison:** Absence of a constant-time string comparison mechanism which ensures that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the input.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Security Measures:** An attacker could potentially bypass the intended security measures of OAuth1, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect flows by successfully guessing or inferring the correct state/nonce values.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** Successfully exploiting this timing attack might enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or resources by manipulating the authentication flow.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker would perform timing analysis by sending multiple crafted requests.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** A MitM attacker could also monitor and analyze the timing of requests to the vulnerable server to infer the correct token.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to Send/Monitor Requests:** Ability to send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable server and measure the time taken for a response.

**7. Patch:**

The vulnerability is addressed by replacing the `strcmp()` function with `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()` which provides constant-time string comparison. The patch affects these files:
  * `src/OAuth1.php`
  * `src/OAuth2.php`
  * `src/OpenIdConnect.php`

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub security advisory (GHSA-w8vh-p74j-x9xp) provides a clear description of the vulnerability, the affected code locations, and the fix.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is **Low**, with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N
