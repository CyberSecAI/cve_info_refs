I pushed some unit tests to <https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/commits/2023-09-luke-DatacarrierBytes-test> (only the latest commit). It looks like some functional tests are failing (`p2p_segwit.py`, at least), and there should be some new functional tests for this PR. I'll try to do that over the next couple of days.

| Concept NACK  The transactions targeted by this pull-req are a very significant source of fee revenue for miners. It is very unlikely that minres will give up that source of revenue. Censoring those transactions would simply encourage the development of private mempools - harmful to small miners - while making fee estimation less reliable. |

| Concept ACK  The transactions targeted by this pull-req. are a very significant source of prohibitive cost for regular node operators. It is very unlikely that regular node operators will give up mitigating that source of operative cost. Regular policy rule for these transactions would encourage the economical resource usage of mempools - not harming any miners - neither changing any fee estimation already on the field. |

| Concept ACK The transactions targeted by this pull-req. are a very significant source of prohibitive cost for regular node operators. It is very unlikely that regular node operators will give up mitigating that source of operative cost. Regular policy rule for these transactions would encourage the economical resource usage of mempools - not harming any miners - neither changing any fee estimation already on the field.  As long as miners continue to mine these transactions they will end up in blocks, requiring node operators to process those transactions. Censoring those transactions simply shifts when that bandwidth usage happens. Indeed, it'll make block propagation happen somewhat slower for some users/miners due to interference with compact blocks. This is harmful to many users, as well as some smaller miners.  Secondly, fee estimation requires knowledge of unconfirmed transactions to determine what the next block will likely consist of. Censoring unconfirmed transactions that could be included in blocks makes it harder to estimate fees correctly because you lack information about the true total demand for blockspace.  There is not censoring of anything. Focusing to propagate that framing is just misleading and dishonest.  Miners entities will propose any block which complies the consensus rules; it was so since the beginning, it is so and it will remain so. Nothing has changed, nothing will change.  If block propagation after consensus rules validation may slow somehow then that would be the cost internalization for mining entities proposing blocks with transaction which increment prohibitively the operation cost for regular node operators.  There are already many mechanisms to increment the fees from an already broadcasted transaction (nobody probably knows that better than the RBF’s proposal author). Furthermore, there is not something called “demand for blockspace”, what there is, is a fee bidding for transaction processing in a timely manner; a compensation for mining entities for losing relative competitiveness with each marginal transaction inclusion. |

| Secondly, fee estimation requires knowledge of unconfirmed transactions to determine what the next block will likely consist of. Censoring unconfirmed transactions that could be included in blocks makes it harder to estimate fees correctly because you lack information about the true total demand for blockspace.  False, I let you compare these two instances of the mempool software you will see that the fees are rarely incorrect.  <https://mempool.space> <https://orangepill.ovh>  Censoring those transactions would simply encourage the development of private mempools - harmful to small miners  You are mistaken about the purpose of this PR, the goal is simply to apply the same restrictions as on OP\_RETURN.  As long as miners continue to mine these transactions they will end up in blocks  Probably false, mining pools require exorbitant fees to mine a tx out of the mempool, thus making the "mint" of "BRC-20 tokens" unprofitable. He will therefore stop having demand for that. |

| You are quite literally word for word repeating talking points made by BSV users  I don't care what BSV people say, and I don't listen to them. Go argue the points themselves, if you can, don't argue based on who makes which points.  harm Bitcoin by spamming the UTXO set  Inscriptions don't do that, unless you mean STAMPS or something else.  And UTXO set increase affects pruned nodes' storage requirement (not RAM, as is commonly misstated on Twitter), and based on conversation with some, only minimally. Regardless, they can pay less by using Inscriptions, yet pay more because they hear threats/antagonism from others to try to filter inscriptions, so they get worried. That's the whole point of the argument that was made all the back in Jan 2023 by Poelstra, and previously by Casey, that op-return is the best way to do it, and interfering will worsen the issue.  creating an unreasonably high fee environment in which the average end user is incentivised not to participate or if so forced into a custodial solution from which their Bitcoin fails to actually be a bearer instrument  Then support efforts to actually scale Bitcoin, like improving layer 2 LN and ARK via efforts like CTV and/or other covenants proposals, and improving efficiency of layer 1. I already addressed this point. This PR's filter change is a larp.  Broadly though, as I explained in a prior post to someone else, the txs where it is not economic to pay the tx fee can still be made if using layer 2 like LN (and sidechains like Liquid, with the new Aqua wallet recently released). So the problem is far overstated, and would be the case even if the bull market arrived and caused a big spike in tx demand and thus tx fees.  So this is not unique, and it is not unsolvable, and it can be improved by focusing energy on actually scaling Bitcoin.  All the connections were made by a random pleb in this video, don't think that because you pretend not to notice or actually are dumb enough not to notice that we wont. We notice the connections  Yeah, typical conspiracy theories, and conspiracy theorists always sound the same (but sometimes they are right). We already had such behavior from bcashers during the block size controversies of the past, and they were famous for becoming deranged because they ended up on the wrong side of reality (sound familiar right now?). The conspiracy theory arguments basically revolve around guilt by association, speculation, misunderstanding, catastrophization, correlation vs. causation fallacy, etc.  But I'll add that if BSVers are serious about wanting to push for a block size increase fork on Bitcoin, then most people in my camp (like 99%?) will obviously be 100% against it. So it's not a real concern.  Bigblockers think they are harming bitcoin because they don't understand how bitcoin works (since they supported big blocks vs. the small block design that bitcoin has). I saw another video where a BSVer is gloating about the fee increases and saying he is spinning up projects to build on bitcoin, but he showed he doesn't understand bitcoin's small-block design and how and why it works.  And whatever involvement BSVers have with the arbitrary data protocols ecosystem is not something that can be prevented. It's obviously a free market.  And Udi trolls a lot as a marketing tactic, then some take him literally and seriously and miss the joke. But if he also pushes some contentious fork, then it's the same story, it would be evaluated on merits, not blindly accepted obviously.  Furthermore you have made so many straw-man arguments in your response  Go prove it, don't make things up because you lack arguments. I tried to directly respond to specific arguments, while also providing extra related information. Maybe you don't understand what strawman argument means.  "re: "scam protocols" -- This is a subjective analysis,"  No it literally is not. They are convincing new and uniformed users that there exists such a thing as satoshis that are more rare than other satoshis. Not only is this completely false and a scam, but if legitimized even a little bit would completely destroy the value proposition of anyone unfortunate enough to encounter this as their experience with Bitcoin.  Nah. First of all, what you are referring to here is "ordinals", which is a collective hallucination Casey developed and some people chose to believe in, similar to the idea of numismatic collector coins. (People earlier last year were saying it is an attack on fungibility and making other irrational arguments, none of which were true if you applied the slightest logic to it.)  It is not false nor scam, it is what some choose to believe. Some people are collectors, they do what seems to be weird, like this. Some large mining pools, like F2pool iirc, already engage in "ordinal theory", since there is a market for "rare sats" and so on. It cannot be stopped, and anyone can make any proposal, then it's up to the market if it cares or not.  Other protocols sell cheaply random generated JPEGs that are not even owned by the recipient in any realistic way, they are totally public domain. Another scam.  I don't pretend to be an expert or understand any of this deeply btw, since I don't do it myself, but it is not a "scam" to buy a jpeg, stupid maybe depending what you value, but not a scam, unless the buyer is being misrepresented about what they are buying. If the buyer knows what it is, then it's not a scam, there is no fraud, they own the private key to the jpeg asset and so claim ownership, and then can and do engage in market buy/sell transactions with others who care about such stuff.  If you cannot see how this makes Bitcoin look like a scam and not money to be taken seriously you should feel sick to your stomach.  People are gambling, like they gamble with lottery tickets/casinos/penny stock trading/leveraged trading/etc. Gambling is not scamming. I know it's popular to call anything and everything a scam, but scam only comes into play if fraud is involved. If the buyer is aware of the situation, it cannot be a scam.  And, as I already said, 'scam or not' is irrelevant to how the Bitcoin protocol, which is neutral, functions. This is not a centralized system. This is a decentralized system. You should think about what that means, instead of trying to force your morality onto a neutral value-transfer protocol like Bitcoin, in which value is subjectively determined (just like Bitcoin itself is subjectively valuable by some, and not by others who claim it is virtual nothingness).  It does not make Bitcoin look like a scam, any more than people using Bitcoin to actually scam people (like with Plus Token or whatever that was called, and the other scams done over the years across the world using Bitcoin) made Bitcoin look like a scam. That is to say, I guess it's subjectively determined again. Some will not be interested in a decentralized permissionless system (with everything it entails -- they'll go to centralized fiat land), while others will respect the unique value offered by a decentralized system.  You can only control how you yourself use Bitcoin, NOT how others use Bitcoin.  You need to learn to remove your ego from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not about you.  People with big egos in Bitcoin's history tended to decide they knew better than Bitcoin, and tragedies ensued from that fatal error. This situation is not the first time it is starting to happen, and it won't be the last time. |

| eragmus, there are ALREADY out of band Txs happening with ViaBtc.... See their latest block with 20 to 30 sat/vByte Txs: <https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001b26d226a7993950d14bec4acce2d85eeb9974a63d9bf>  It seems to me that there are 2 camps here.. Those that think the standard Txs (including IsDust() ) should be defined for the benefit of the monetary network as a whole.... and then those, who think that these standard Txs should be defined by miners, pools on an individual basis. GetDustThreashold() includes the following comment:  "If you'd pay more in fees than the value of the output to spend something, then we consider it dust."  These standard Tx policies are obviously GOOD for the efficiency of the monetary network, and dust obviously shouldn't be hardcoded at 3 sat/vByte if the network never again drops below 20~40 sat/vByte.  The integrity of the network and the real worth to miners is not short-term fees, but long-term growth and adoption of the MONETARY network itself. "Permisionless file storage" and dusty tokens that price out monetary Txs do NOT make a good combatant to the central banks, which IS the purpose of Bitcoin.. as evidenced in the Genesis Block itself. Nowhere did Satoshi Nakamoto mention the right to "trustlessly inscribe cartoons", but he definitely mentioned that Bitcoiners would want to keep the network slim, efficient, and focused. I truly hope that this goal is not lost on others, miners and core devs included.  Most people know that to truly understand Bitcoin itself, you need to study cryptography, economics, programming, etc. This specific issue definitely needs some study in history and even language (defining things like "Bitcoin" itself, "standard Tx", "dust", etc. To throw all this out because it makes miners happy in the short-term is... well, short-sighted to say the least, while a large portion of Bitcoiners would say it's sacrilegious. To take something as sacred as freedom money, a tool to exit the fiat system, and then boast about fiat gains, is completely losing sight of the mission. |

Nowhere did I deny out of band txs are already happening. I said they will only get worse, if filtering is used as a policy response. And I said out of band txs can be logically reduced, if relay policies are aligned with consensus policies, instead of being out of sync and thus creating a reason for out of band txs.  The integrity of the network and the real worth to miners is not short-term fees, but long-term growth and adoption of the MONETARY network itself.

To take something as sacred as freedom money, a tool to exit the fiat system, and then boast about fiat gains, is completely losing sight of the mission.  Bitcoin works on economic incentives, not altruism. This is a core principle that needs to be internalized.  And fees are exactly how bitcoin's security model is designed, fees and price of bitcoin. But price of bitcoin can't be controlled, and can be impacted by events out of our control, like macroeconomic climate and other global situations. Only fees are under our control, in terms of generating use cases that pay significant fees to offset the exponentially-declining subsidy paid by Bitcoin's inflation. The integrity of the network longterm revolves around tx fees. And fees matter because miners get paid by fees, longterm, to secure the network, as the subsidy becomes too nominal to matter.  I've also stated several times in this thread (and surely others have too?), and it should be obvious if you think about it a little, that pricing out of lower-value normal txs is not a real concern, if using layer 2 networks like LN (and, in response to high fees, we recently got an easy to use wallet, Aqua, for sidechains like Liquid) to amortize cost of layer 1 tx fee. Actually if you send LN tx directly from LN-compatible exchange to a wallet, or Liquid bitcoin from exchange to wallet, like with Aqua, and then pay with only LN or Liquid, then you completely escape the layer 1 fee. -- And to focus efforts on actually useful efforts like scaling bitcoin via improving efficiency of layer 2 networks like LN and ARK, via CTV or other covenant proposals.  This is getting so repetitive. It's like people don't care to actually read the prior discussion and understand it, before repeating the same old arguments over and over and over... |

| "Bitcoin works on economic incentives"  is not just some magical phrase you can throw around and make your assertions true. the incentives for full node runners are becoming smaller and smaller every single day. this demonstrably hurts decentralization of bitcoin. you people would care about that if you actually cared about the state of the mempool, but instead you are concern trolling that setting a filter to EVENLY DISTRIBUTE COST for all transactions will kill the mempool. Your fallacious arguments are tiring. |

Actually if you send LN tx directly from LN-compatible exchange to a wallet, or Liquid bitcoin from exchange to wallet, like with Aqua, and then pay with only LN or Liquid, then you completely escape the layer 1 fee. -- And to focus efforts on actually useful efforts like scaling bitcoin via improving efficiency of layer 2 networks like LN and ARK, via CTV or other covenant proposals.  You can only control how you yourself use Bitcoin, NOT how others use Bitcoin.  It is funny how you say Bitcoin isn't about you however you think you can tell me what I can and cannot find to be a concern. Your hypocrisy is plenty evident. You should try having consistent arguments next time you blatantly lie to people who are more informed about the topic than you are. Just a couple years ago people like P Wuille himself were saying he does not even know how lightning works at all, now we are saying its totally cool to thrust end users into it (we know it is not ready for that, far too many issues with routing to scale, current liquidity / volume is garbage compared to real financial systems). I have studied lightning myself, I have several channels, it is NOWHERE NEAR prepared to scale bitcoin if we do not deal with UTXO set spam and mempool fee over-payment spam / constant inorganic end user prohibitive fee spikes first. It proves ignorance of lightning and timelock based protocols IN GENERAL to misunderstand why prohibitive l1 fees coming from a publicly announced inorganic source that intends to attack the network is not positive. |

| "Bitcoin works on economic incentives"  is not just some magical phrase you can throw around and make your assertions true. the incentives for full node runners are becoming smaller and smaller every single day. this demonstrably hurts decentralization of bitcoin. you people would care about that if you actually cared about the state of the mempool, but instead you are concern trolling that setting a filter to EVENLY DISTRIBUTE COST for all transactions will kill the mempool. Your fallacious arguments are tiring.  It's true, and it's not my problem if you don't understand how Bitcoin works, or refuse to accept it.  As for node runners, as usual, this was addressed already in this thread, if you bothered to read it and understand the prior discussion, instead of spamming the thread. Or you could think for yourself, and actually figure out the answer? -- Which is that full node runners' storage is not affected worse by this situation vs. what would happen if the blocks were full of "normal" txs. And consensus already agreed to the current block size limits during the segwit fork, so the growth limits were agreed to and is bounded, and it was understood that growth rates are not sufficiently problematic for full nodes (and this was the case in 2017 or when segwit was implemented, while now it's 2024, 6 years later, with improved technology and even less concern).  It is funny how you say Bitcoin isn't about you however you think you can tell me what I can and cannot find to be a concern.  What I said applies to the one changing Bitcoin. That would be you.  people like P Wuille himself were saying he does not even know how lightning works at all, now we are saying its totally cool to thrust end users into it (we know it is not ready for that, far too many issues with routing to scale, current liquidity / volume is garbage compared to real financial systems)  Plenty of people use it and have mostly no problems.  And it is only 1 option I gave. You can support efforts, as I already said, to improve LN functionality, like with CTV or other covenant proposals.  And you can use Liquid sidechain, via the Aqua wallet.  But you are not entitled, as bcashers also felt entitled, to use Bitcoin layer 1 for lower-value txs despite being unable to afford the layer 1 tx fee. Bitcoin doesn't scale via layer 1, it scales via other layers. We established this during block size controversy, and if you don't agree with this decision, consider using bcash instead?  source that intends to attack the network  Using bitcoin in a way you disagree with, and paying for the privilege with competitive tx fees, is not an "attack". What's an attack is feeling entitled to pay low fees on layer 1 to make txs on Bitcoin, and trying to bully developers to cater to your false understanding of Bitcoin.  "Read my arguments more carefully? Nowhere did I deny out of band txs are already happening. I said they will only get worse"  If they are already happening it literally does not matter if they get any worse, your arguments are incredibly weak and you have shown that you do not understand the basic situation and or are maliciously ignorant.  If that's what you think about my arguments, and those of others here who basically make similar or same arguments, you have a few options (since Bitcoin is not a democracy & since Core obviously lacks rough consensus to be able to implement the proposed change):   * Use Knots (which has your desired filter policies), OR fork Core (to adjust the policies yourself) and use the forked Core, thereby continuing to use Bitcoin. * Sell your bitcoin (if you own any?), and buy OR create a cryptocurrency that better aligns with what you want (something more centralized that you can take charge of, so you are able to make whichever changes are desired & whenever they are desired).   Good luck. |

| It is highly troubling to see this discord between people involved in bitcoin.  As someone who recently joined the community, I find it unsettling.  Bitcoin is a decentralized system, so discord is natural. The guy I've been talking with is particularly nasty, but this is fortunately not the norm in the discussion thread, if you read the rest of it.  My stance is that monetary proposition of bitcoin is the one and only thing that core team must be focused on, but now I see that goal is lost, intentionally or not.  I know people think of it idealistically this way, as did I for a long time (actually until Jan of 2023, when I thought about it more deeply), but it is not realistic to force people to use their bitcoin in one narrow manner. Bitcoin is a permissionless network. People will inherently use it for whatever they personally find useful.   * Some will hodl their bitcoin, and almost never make a tx. * Some will spend it, or not spend it based on bad tax policies and reporting requirements and price volatility and lack of consumer protection and lack of ease of use and so on. * Some will gamble with it, in 100 different ways, either sending it back and forth between wallet and exchanges for trading and arbitrage, or with jpegs.   It is not a black/white situation either, where it's either 100% monetary use or 0% monetary use. It will be based on competitive tx fee rates determining the proportion of uses. Basically, the market will decide the price of miners' precious layer 1 block space (fee rate), and what proportion of use cases by the buyers.  Everyone like to spout 'decentralization', but how is pushing people to sidechains not centralization is beyond me. I find argument that everything will be solved with L2/L3, especially coming from core devs,... Wrong for the lack of better word.  Decentralization comes in degrees.   * Layer 1 offers most decentralization, yet has the highest tx fee and 10 min average (yet variable) block time. = high economic value txs that can afford a high tx fee * Layer 2 like LN has a little less decentralization, yet has very low tx fee and instant reliable transaction speed. -- low/medium economic value txs that can afford a low tx fee * Sidechain like Liquid is perhaps semi-decentralized (globally distributed federation model), but has low tx fee and 1 min block time and confidential transactions for privacy (etc.). -- low/medium economic value txs that can afford a low tx fee   There are tradeoffs across different layers. This is how blockchain works to remain decentralized. Blockchain is not magic.  Core team imho should be focusing on fixing existing issues with L1 and one of those problems is staring us in the face.  Simple fact of the matter is it can't be fixed (without some type of fork), and the reasons why have been explained ad nauseam in this thread.  And a fork would obviously be a very big deal; first, it would need to be figured out (one idea is implementing Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin, just as it is on the Liquid sidechain), and then it would need to gain rough consensus that pros sufficiently > cons. |

| I hope the following information helps in adding clarity to the thought process of folks who advocate otherwise:  "Satoshi made only 1 mistake, which I believe is the root of the confusion among some Bitcoiners who defend spam.  He used the same name bitcoin - to define two different elements: the asset, and the network.  Although they are interdependent, they possess very distinct properties.  The network is decentralized, permission-less, and resistant to censorship - not the asset.  The asset is divisible, portable, scarce, and durable - not the network.  Crucially, to benefit from the asset's properties, one must have access to the network, and vice versa.  For instance, imagine holding a certain amount of BTC in self-custody, but facing prohibitively high fees that prevent you from moving it, essentially blocking access to the network. In this scenario, the Bitcoin loses its portability and divisibility.  Conversely, consider running 100 nodes, but for some reason being unable to acquire the asset.  Those who justify spam under the pretext of "Bitcoin is for enemies" fail to grasp this crucial distinction between the asset and the network.  Bitcoin - the asset - is for adversaries.  However, Bitcoin the network must be safeguarded at all costs, or we risk losing all the properties that define Bitcoin."  Credit for this information goes to @matteopelleg  My argument would be that Bitcoin - the network - needs to be protected from spam RIGHT NOW and if corporate sponsored devs at core with merge rights are incompetent in understanding the situation or to put the solution in place, they should step down and let other non corporate funded, community oriented, technically more skilled devs take control of the situation and make efforts to fix the spam issue.  Core does not belong to devs sponsored by one or two companies. It's a shared code and we all need to take responsibility of fixing the issue of spam.  Thank you. |

[datacarriersize: Match more datacarrying #28408 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1877812112)  Review Concept NACK. Trying to keep the points that have already been said short:   * This will not prevent ordinals. Given the high fees, this policy is incentive-incompatible to adopt as a miner. Even if this relay policy is adopted, this has not stopped ordinals in the past (4MB tx [in mempool.space](https://mempool.space/tx/0301e0480b374b32851a9462db29dc19fe830a7f7d7a88b81612b9d42099c0ae), [in ordiscan](https://ordiscan.com/inscription/652), as [tweeted](https://x.com/udiWertheimer/status/1621176136142045191?s=20)). * This change is likely harmful to the node by making its mempool exclude transactions that will be mined. This is a restriction to default policy, which can impact many users beyond an individual node operator, including making it difficult for people to access existing funds, and disrupting compact block relay. * This will not prevent data-carrying transactions. See above. It may be best to leave the methods that are most efficient wrt network resource costs. * People are calling this "spam" because they don't like ordinals. While I also personally think Bitcoin is best used for financial transactions, I disagree with this framing of "spam." In transaction validation and relay logic, we should define spam on the basis of network resources consumed and whether those costs are well bounded and/or paid for, *not on the basis of use case*. We have no way of detecting whether a bunch of bytes are real/legitimate/useful and, even if we could, it is not protocol development's place to decide which use cases of Bitcoin are legitimate and which ones aren't. |

| Concept NACK Purpose of `datacarriersize` `datacarriersize` refers to the payload of OP\_RETURN outputs, the output type that was introduced as a data carrier to provide an alternative for more harmful ways of embedding data. At that time, there was a worry that any blockspace production in excess of the demand from monetary transactions would be filled for cheap since demand for highly replicated perpetual storage is unbounded. Bounding standard transactions to a single data carrier output per transaction with a limited weight didn’t prevent users from using blockspace in this manner, but discouraged that use by increasing the overhead and cost.  Today, there is sufficient demand for blockspace from monetary transactions that blocks were full most of the week even before inscriptions got traction. As such, when the inscription hype brought additional demand to the network, a robust blockspace market emerged that required competitive bids for every vbyte of blockspace. We have been expecting a similar situation in a few years if adoption continued to increase just from additional demand of monetary transactions. The current blockspace market is a valuable preview for wallet developers, Bitcoin advocates, and users to scrutinize their design and narrative. There would be little need to introduce protective mempool policies such as `datacarriersize` today: when blocks are full, the price of blockspace already discourages low-value use on its own. Underlying motivation of discouraging inscriptions Clearly this PR is largely supported by those that would like to discourage inscriptions. While I agree that inscriptions and especially BRC20 tokens seem idiotic, their use of the witness section is far less harmful than many other ways of embedding data in the blockchain. However, this patch would fail to prevent relay of inscriptions. Bitcoin users are spending hundreds of bitcoins in fees on inscription transactions per week. If Bitcoin Core were to release a version that filters inscriptions in the manner proposed here, the inscription enthusiasts could maintain relay of inscriptions on the network by ensuring that a small fraction of the nodes on the network does not filter inscriptions.—This patch would trivially fail to achieve its goal because the proponents of the discouraged behavior would not participate in enforcing it.—The inscription proponents would be inadvertently supported by the large count of nodes that run older versions. Further, it is obvious that a block template built from a filtered mempool must result in a lower total block reward than one built from all unconfirmed transactions. This means that any miners filtering inscriptions reduce their own revenue to the benefit of non-filtering miners. This leads to a prisoner’s dilemma where the reward for dissent is greater as more miners filter. Therefore campaigning for miners to filter inscriptions seems self-defeating in a world where a significant portion of blockspace is purchased for inscription transactions.  In the end, users running this patch still process blocks including inscriptions. They only harm their own feerate estimation, slow down their block validation, and are less useful peers to other nodes. It seems to me that the proposed change here is more harmful than beneficial. |

| eragmus  You are quite literally word for word repeating talking points made by BSV users who intend to harm Bitcoin by spamming the UTXO set and creating an unreasonably high fee environment in which the average end user is incentivised not to participate or if so forced into a custodial solution from which their Bitcoin fails to actually be a bearer instrument.  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RswZDQTqsI>  All the connections were made by a random pleb in this video, don't think that because you pretend not to notice or actually are dumb enough not to notice that we wont. We notice the connections.  How Sarcasm Works:  Maxi: "Did you eat *another* doughnut?" Ordinal User: "Yes, and I ate it just to spite you" Maxi: "Ordinals users only care about spreading pain, they are willing to eat not because they are hungry, but just to destroy good food and deny others the opportunity for nourishment."  I dont think youll be able to reliably cling to a video of BSVers trolling you as evidence of the total illegitimacy of ordinals if irony sarcasm and spite exist, and I checked, they do exist. It makes sense after the reaction to ordinals that people might overstate themselves in the way designed to bother you as they have here. "We're here to ruin bitcoin" is not a sincere statement, it's meant to mock your reactions which seems beyond your understanding or maybe just your honesty. |

| "Bitcoin works on economic incentives"  is not just some magical phrase you can throw around and make your assertions true. the incentives for full node runners are becoming smaller and smaller every single day. this demonstrably hurts decentralization of bitcoin. you people would care about that if you actually cared about the state of the mempool, but instead you are concern trolling that setting a filter to EVENLY DISTRIBUTE COST for all transactions will kill the mempool. Your fallacious arguments are tiring.  Except that most new noderunners are ordinals indexers and inscribers. Ordinals are here to stay, fork off or accept it. |

| Seems pointless to argue the politics of the change when CI doesn't even pass:  ``` tests.cpp:1570:35: error: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace,-warnings-as-errors]  test/script_tests.cpp(1492): error: in "script_tests/script_DataCarrierBytes": check 13 == (CScript() << zeros(11) << OP_DROP).DatacarrierBytes() has failed [13 != 0]  ```  There are two different aspects of mempool policy: what you can configure the software to enforce, and the defaults. From that view, this PR is flawed in two ways:   * it couples the policy on OP\_RETURN output size and the new limits on data embedded in redundant script code, so that it's impossible to configure your node in a way that matches the default policy for 26.0 and earlier releases * it changes the default policy to reject transactions with data embedded in redundant script code in a way that would reject a significant amount of high feerate transactions, and thus would likely not match the policy adopted by the majority of hashrate   So that's an Approach NACK for me.  I believe core's strategy for PRs that add disabled-by-default mempool/relay rules is that it's fine for add config options if people want to set their own rules for their own node, even if that will result in them diverging from the network at large, provided the code supporting the option is reasonably small/self-contained/maintainable, and there's at least some demand for the option. On that basis I expect I'd be happy to invert that nack if the PR were modified to introduce an independent option for blocking txs with redundant script code that defaulted to off. (And also fixed the bugs that are resulting in CI failure, obviously)  (Note that Knots has also recently introduced (see [1](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/commit/53b0296feb0e2ab44440c05ff9476f84951c0f36) and [2](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/commit/e40ba918fd2afae2ec031e739f1d28367875aae1)) a default limit of 1650 bytes for scripts, which eg limits CHECKSIGADD-based multisig to about k/50; rather than up to about 1000/4000. I'm not sure there's actually any demand for that change in additional to filtering inscriptions, but if there is, presumably it would also be acceptable as a default-off policy option in core)  I expect I'd remain a nack on changing the default unless there was clear evidence that a majority of hashrate was either supportive-of or indifferent-to the change, eg a majority of blocks were already excluding these transactions. (ie, I'd accept that as resolving most of the concerns expressed in [sipa's comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1877812112))  Personally I think changes here (whether adding an option or changing the default) is unlikely to have any effect outside of generating tweets/articles/podcast episodes, and that in the unlikely event that it did have any effect, that would only be for witness-embedded data to use a different pattern. (ie, basically, [what Murch said](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1878746998)) |

| All these people really care about is being able to inscribe data in an immutable and decentralized manner, they don't really care about it being done on BTC blockchain in particular. I feel like if someone came along and created a solution for this purpose purely run on fees (basically a blockchain without the concept of token ownership) this would probably solve the problem IMO. Obviously there would be the issue of needing to somehow pay miners, but that part not being centralized isn't necessarily an issue. However there's not really any profit incentive to do so.  Bitcoin is the best "immutable and decentralized" network in existence, so those who care about that part (& are willing to pay the fee to do so) have no incentive to use anything else. The ones who don't care use a centralized shitcoin like Solana, or keep using Ethereum (out of inertia, or hope it's a good enough medium option).  The incentive would be lower fees as they don't need to compete with people wanting to make legitimate btc txs |

It is a complete fallacy to start imagining reasoning for organic usage in an instance where the entities funding it have literally admitted they are doing so in an effort to harm the Bitcoin network. They care about bloating the UTXO set and making regular transaction costs prohibitive for the end users of Bitcoin, something that can clearly be seen by all users.  where is the evidence that the majority of inscription fees are being motivated by network harm as opposed to immutable record of information? |

| It's abundantly clear that this PR is controversial and, in its current state, has no hope of reaching a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone. At this point in time, I see no reason to leave this open and to continue to send notifications for the constant back-and-forth stalemate discussion. |

# How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from very old versions of Bitcoin Core or Knots is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Knots are generally supported.

# Compatibility

Bitcoin Knots is supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel,
macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use
Bitcoin Knots on unsupported systems.

# Known Bugs

In various locations, including the GUI's transaction details dialog, transaction
virtual sizes may not account for an unusually high number of sigops (ie, as
determined by the `-bytespersigop` policy). This could result in reporting a
lower virtual size than is actually used for mempool or mining purposes.

In the interest of time, this release does not include updated translations.
Please open an issue on GitHub if this is of particular importance to you or
anyone you know. If nobody expresses interest in localization, it may continue
to be skipped going forward.

# Notable changes

## Security vulnerabilities fixed

Several security issues (CVEs CVE-2023-40257, CVE-2023-40258, and CVE-2023-40259)
were identified in the extended `rpcauth` wallet-restriction syntax, which is
intended to enable semi-trusted local applications using the Bitcoin Knots API to
access only specific wallets (or none at all) and not others. The full details of
these issues will be disclosed at a future time, but they have all been fixed in
this release.

## P2P and network changes

* To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers
  has been reworked. This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the
  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).

  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either
  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at
  the node's tip, a "presync" phase will begin, in which the node will download the
  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing
  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,
  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.

  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for
  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect
  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less
  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism
  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)
* Enable parallel compact block downloads to mitigate temporary stalls from a slow peer. (#27626)
* The rate limit on transaction relay has been doubled to 14 transactions per
  second (35 tx/s for outbound connections) to better adapt to present network
  conditions. (#28592)
* Transactions of non-witness size 65 and above are now allowed by mempool
  and relay policy. This is to better reflect the actual afforded protections
  against CVE-2017-12842 and open up additional use-cases of smaller transaction sizes. (#26265)
* With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound
  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)
* A new net permission `forceinbound` (set with `-whitelist=forceinbound@...`
  or `-whitebind=forceinbound@...`) is introduced that extends `noban` permissions.
  Inbound connections from hosts protected by `forceinbound` will now be more
  likely to connect even if `maxconnections` is reached and the node's inbound
  slots are full. This is achieved by attempting to force the eviction of a random,
  inbound, otherwise unprotected peer. RPC `getpeerinfo` will also now indicate
  `forced_inbound`. (#27600)
* The `-datacarriersize` policy limit has been updated to match newer style datacarrier
  transactions. (#28408)
* An additional `-datacarriercost` option has also been added to avoid giving the "segwit
  discount" to aribitrary data (and can be increased to require datacarrier transactions
  to pay higher fees).
* The spam filters limiting smart contract code sizes for pre-Segwit and Segwit
  "v0" scripts have been expanded to also cover Taproot. Since the sizes were
  inconsistent, the lower size of 1650 which actually had a rationale has been
  used as the default for this release. The size limit can be adjusted with the
  new `-maxscriptsize` option. If you know of any legitimate scripts that are
  larger than the default, please report a bug.

## New RPCs

* A new `getprioritisedtransactions` RPC has been added. It returns a map of all fee deltas created by the
  user with prioritisetransaction, indexed by txid. The map also indicates whether each transaction is
  present in the mempool.
* `getaddrmaninfo` has been added to view the distribution of addresses in the
  new and tried table of the node's address manager across different networks
  (ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns). The RPC returns count of addresses in new
  and tried table as well as their sum for all networks. (#27511, #28565)

## Updated RPCs

* The `verifychain` RPC will now return `false` if the checks didn't fail,
  but couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level. This could be due
  to missing data while pruning, due to an insufficient dbcache or due to
  the node being shutdown before the call could finish. (#25574)
* `sendrawtransaction` has a new, optional argument, `maxburnamount` with a default value of `0`.
  Any transaction containing an unspendable output with a value greater than `maxburnamount` will
  not be submitted. At present, the outputs deemed unspendable are those with scripts that begin
  with an `OP_RETURN` code (known as 'datacarriers'), scripts that exceed the maximum script size,
  and scripts that contain invalid opcodes.
* The `testmempoolaccept` RPC now returns 2 additional results within the "fees" result:
  "effective-feerate" is the feerate including fees and sizes of transactions validated together if
  package validation was used, and also includes any modified fees from prioritisetransaction. The
  "effective-includes" result lists the wtxids of transactions whose modified fees and sizes were used
  in the effective-feerate (#26646).
* `decodescript` may now infer a Miniscript descriptor under P2WSH context if it is not lacking
  information. (#27037)
* `finalizepsbt` is now able to finalize a transaction with inputs spending Miniscript-compatible
  P2WSH scripts. (#24149)
* The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed. The
  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was
  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is
  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.
* The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.
  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,
  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results
  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to
  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.
  (#25171)
* The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level
  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no
  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,
  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.
  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.
  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)
* The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,
  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the
  "P2P and network changes" section above.
* RPC `disconnectnode` now accepts a subnet into `address` argument. (#26576)
* The output from `getmempoolinfo` is extended to include a `rbf_policy` key
  briefly describing the current replace-by-fee policy ("never", "optin", or
  "always").

Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.

## Build System

* The `--enable-upnp-default` and `--enable-natpmp-default` options
  have been removed. If you want to use port mapping, you can
  configure it using a .conf file, or by passing the relevant
  options at runtime. (#26896)

## Updated settings

* If the `-checkblocks` or `-checklevel` options are explicitly provided by the
  user, but the verification checks cannot be completed due to an insufficient
  dbcache, Bitcoin Knots will now return an error at startup. (#25574)
* Setting `-blocksonly` will now reduce the maximum mempool memory
  to 5MB (users may still use `-maxmempool` to override). Previously,
  the default 300MB would be used, leading to unexpected memory usage
  for users running with `-blocksonly` expecting it to eliminate
  mempool memory usage.

  As unused mempool memory is shared with dbcache, this also reduces
  the dbcache size for users running with `-blocksonly`, potentially
  impacting performance.
* Setting `-maxconnections=0` will now disable `-dnsseed`
  and `-listen` (users may still set them to override).

Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.

## New settings

* The `shutdownnotify` option is used to specify a command to execute synchronously
  before Bitcoin Knots has begun its shutdown sequence. (#23395)
* To assist in controlling access to the RPC "cookie" file on multiuser systems, a new
  `rpccookieperms` setting has been added to set the file permissions mode before
  writing the access token.

## Wallet

* Added a new `next_index` field in the response in `listdescriptors` to
  have the same format as `importdescriptors` (#26194)
* RPC `listunspent` now has a new argument `include_immature_coinbase`
  to include coinbase UTXOs that don't meet the minimum spendability
  depth requirement (which before were silently skipped). (#25730)
* Rescans for descriptor wallets are now significantly faster if compact
  block filters (BIP158) are available. Since those are not constructed
  by default, the configuration option "-blockfilterindex=1" has to be
  provided to take advantage of the optimization. This improves the
  performance of the RPC calls `rescanblockchain`, `importdescriptors`
  and `restorewallet`. (#25957)
* RPC `unloadwallet` now fails if a rescan is in progress. (#26618)
* Wallet passphrases may now contain null characters.
  Prior to this change, only characters up to the first
  null character were recognized and accepted. (#27068)
* Address Purposes strings are now restricted to the currently known values of "send",
  "receive", and "refund". Wallets that have unrecognized purpose strings will have
  loading warnings, and the `listlabels` RPC will raise an error if an unrecognized purpose
  is requested. (#27217)
* In the `createwallet`, `loadwallet`, `unloadwallet`, and `restorewallet` RPCs, the
  "warning" string field is deprecated in favor of a "warnings" field that
  returns a JSON array of strings to better handle multiple warning messages and
  for consistency with other wallet RPCs. The "warning" field will be fully
  removed from these RPCs in v26. It can be temporarily re-enabled during the
  deprecation period by launching bitcoind with the configuration option
  `-deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield`. (#27279)
* Descriptor wallets can now spend coins sent to P2WSH Miniscript descriptors. (#24149)
* The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The
  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)
* The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and
  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created
  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)
* The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript
  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using
  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.
  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)
* The `tr()` output descriptor now supports multisig scripts through the `multi_a()` and
  `sortedmulti_a()` functions. (#24043)
* The `importdescriptors` RPC can now be used to import BIP 93 (codex32) seeds. (#27351)
* To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output
  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)
* The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new
  `parent_descs` field for every "receive" entry. (#25504)
* A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command. (#25504)
* RPC `importaddress` now supports watch-only descriptor wallets.
* RPC `walletprocesspsbt` return object now includes field `hex` (if the transaction
  is complete) containing the serialized transaction suitable for RPC `sendrawtransaction`. (#28414)
* The result of RPC `getaddressinfo` adds an `isactive` key which can be used to determine if
  the address is derived from the currently active wallet seed. (#27216)
* RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, "Label not found
  in wallet" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)

## Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets

An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to
Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the
[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).

## GUI changes

* The "Mask values" is a persistent option now. (gui#701)
* The "Mask values" option affects the "Transaction" view now, in addition to the
  "Overview" one. (gui#708)
* A new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (gui#471).
* Configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,
  proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to `<datadir>/settings.json`
  file rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktop
  config files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of being
  ignored. (#15936, gui#602)
* Also, the interaction between GUI settings and `bitcoin.conf` settings is
  simplified. Settings from `bitcoin.conf` are now displayed normally in the GUI
  settings dialog, instead of in a separate warning message ("Options set in this
  dialog are overridden by the configuration file: -setting=value"). And these
  settings can now be edited because `settings.json` values take precedence over
  `bitcoin.conf` values. (#15936)

## REST

* A new `/rest/deploymentinfo` endpoint has been added for fetching various
  state info regarding deployments of consensus changes. (#25412)
* The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use
  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The
  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old
  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.

  For `/headers`, use
  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`
  instead of
  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)

  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use
  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`
  instead of
  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)

  (#24098)

## Binary verification

* The binary verification script has been updated. In previous releases it
  would verify that the binaries had been signed with a single "release key".
  In this release and moving forward it will verify that the binaries are
  signed by a *threshold of trusted keys*. For more details and
  examples, see:
  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/verify-binaries/README.md>
  (#27358)

# Low-level changes

## RPC

* The JSON-RPC server now rejects requests where a parameter is specified multiple
  times with the same name, instead of silently overwriting earlier parameter values
  with later ones. (#26628)
* RPC `listsinceblock` now accepts an optional `label` argument
  to fetch incoming transactions having the specified label. (#25934)
* Previously `setban`, `addpeeraddress`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, methods
  allowed non-boolean and non-null values to be passed as boolean parameters.
  Any string, number, array, or object value that was passed would be treated
  as false. After this change, passing any value except `true`, `false`, or
  `null` now triggers a JSON value is not of expected type error. (#26213)
* The `deriveaddresses`, `getdescriptorinfo`, `importdescriptors` and `scantxoutset` commands now
  accept Miniscript expression within a `wsh()` descriptor. (#24148)
* The `getaddressinfo`, `decodescript`, `listdescriptors` and `listunspent` commands may now output
  a Miniscript descriptor inside a `wsh()` where a `wsh(raw())` descriptor was previously returned. (#24148)

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

```

Summary: Never confirming transactions

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.
