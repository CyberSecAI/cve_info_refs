Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of input sanitization/validation in multiple areas
    *   "基本信息"->"备案号" and “公安备案号” fields allow direct HTML input.
    *   “广告管理” section is vulnerable to HTML injection
    *   Hyperlinks in the rich text editor can be manipulated to bypass the front-end's automatic "http://" addition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages.
*   This can lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript code through the following input fields:
    *   "基本信息"->"备案号" and “公安备案号” fields
    *   “广告管理” section
    *   Manipulated hyperlinks within the rich text editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the EyouCMS application to inject the malicious code through the identified fields.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond the ability to edit the affected settings.
