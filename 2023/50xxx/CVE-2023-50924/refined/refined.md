Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient validation of user-supplied data in the DECT number, mobile number, and work-log comment fields within the Engelsystem application before version 3.4.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize or encode user input in the aforementioned fields before displaying them in log overviews. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' sessions when they view affected pages such as overview pages. The injected code could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions within the application on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the user interface by manipulating the DECT number, mobile number, or work-log comment fields with malicious JavaScript. This stored payload is then rendered to other users who view the log overviews.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Engelsystem application.
- No special privileges are required beyond having an account.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the specified input fields (DECT number, mobile number, work-log comments) with malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "Skruppy" and the remediation was done by "MyIgel".
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.4.1 with the commit `efda1ffc1ce59f02a7d237d9087adea26e73ec5f`.
- The commit diff shows that the fix involves using `htmlspecialchars()` on various outputs to escape HTML special characters, thus preventing the execution of injected scripts.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.3, classified as "High" severity with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
