The provided content is related to CVE-2023-50612.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA) in CloudExplorer Lite v1.4.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient access controls allow unauthorized access to sensitive cloud account credentials.
- The application exposes cloud account API keys (specifically "ak" and "sk" for Huawei Cloud, "secretId" and "secretKey" for Tencent Cloud) through API endpoints, allowing any user-level attacker to view them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full access to the cloud account owned by the manager, leading to a vertical privilege escalation.
- The attacker can use the exposed API keys to perform any actions permitted by the cloud account, such as creating or deleting resources and accessing data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a GET request to the API endpoints `/management-center/api/cloud_account/page` or `/vm-service/api/server/catalog/goods`.
- An attacker can use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the server responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user-level account in the CloudExplorer Lite application.
- The attacker needs to have access to the network where the application is running.
- No special privileges or admin-level access are required to exploit this vulnerability.
