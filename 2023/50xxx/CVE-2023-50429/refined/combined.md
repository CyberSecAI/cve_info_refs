# IzyBat Orange casiers - SQL injection (CVE-2023-50429)

High

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-mc3w-rv8p-f9xf
Dec 4, 2023

## Package

Orange casiers
(IzyBat)

## Affected versions

<20230803\_1

## Patched versions

20230803\_1

## Description

### Overview

Possible SQL injection from the web portal <https://orange-casiers.fr/>

### Details

SQL injection makes it possible to retrieve the RFID of employees in the database, which allows them to emulate their badge (e.g. with a zero pinball machine) and open their locker(s). In addition, SQLi allows you to recover the entire database (email, password hashes, etc.).

The vulnerability concerns the `getEnsemble.php` endpoint on a POST request and it is the ensemble parameter which is vulnerable. See [PoC\_1](https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/blob/main/IzyBat/poc1.png)

### Proof of Concept

See [PoC\_2](https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/blob/main/IzyBat/poc2.png), [PoC\_3](https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/blob/main/IzyBat/poc3.png), [PoC\_4](https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/blob/main/IzyBat/poc4.png)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
