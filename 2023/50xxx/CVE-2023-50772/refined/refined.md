Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50772:

**CVE-2023-50772**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The Dingding JSON Pusher Plugin stores access tokens unencrypted.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin stores access tokens in plain text within job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weakness:** Sensitive access tokens are stored in a recoverable format.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with `Item/Extended Read` permissions or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted tokens.
*   **Attack Vector:** Access to the Jenkins controller filesystem, or having the required `Item/Extended Read` permission for a specific job.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to read the contents of the Jenkins configuration files or have `Item/Extended Read` permissions.
*   **Additional Detail**: The plugin's configuration form also does not mask these tokens, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.
